Summary
-------

Light snow is expected this week across the North Country with
the best chances for a fresh 1â€“2 inches for skiing fresh tracks
on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. If you're planning a trip for
next weekend, the forecast is currently looking very cold.

Short Term Forecast
-------------------

Several inches of snow fell on Sunday into Sunday night across
southern and southeast New England. The storm responsible for
that snow is now pulling away from New England and on its way to
Nova Scotia; we now have a weak ridge of high pressure about to
crest overhead on Monday morning.

 network snowfall reports as of 7:30AM on Monday morning.

Our next "storm" moves in quickly as another weak region of low
pressure crosses through southeast Canada on Monday afternoon.
Light snow showers across the North Country will give way to snow
showers in upslope flow through Monday night. The light snow and
snow showers will produce 1–3 inches of new snow across the Green
and White Mountains.

NAM model forecast animation for 7AM Monday through 7AM Tuesday.

The week ahead is shaping up to be relatively quiet. We will
likely see another similar round of light snow on Wednesday night
with snow showers in upslope flow continuing into Thursday
morning. This storm should also produce another 1–3 inches across
the Greens and Whites. Otherwise, the weather is just going to
get colder as we head into next weekend (24–25 Jan) with daytime
highs and overnight lows below zero possible.

I actually hope that the forecast is wrong and that we see some
walk-back/moderation over the next several days. The latest
forecast for the mountains (e.g., Killington and Jay Peak below)
is for windchill temperatures between –55F and –25F on Friday (24
Jan) through Monday (26 Jan). If this forecast verifies, we'll
likely see a couple resorts take actions around potential cold
exposure. It's not fun skiing with air temperatures of –20F to
–10F and windchills below –30F; it's quite the opposite.

Extended Forecast
-----------------

One of the few storms worth mentioning in the extended range
forecast is on Sunday (25 January) over the Mid-Atlantic. The
models are suggesting that the region of Arctic high pressure
responsible for our cold-air outbreak will keep the storm track
south of New England next weekend. Most model ensembles (see
below) are indicating that a fairly large winter storm (featuring
snow, freezing rain, and rain) will cross the south-central U.S.
bringing snow to the Mid-Atlantic on Sunday (25 Jan).

We will need to watch the model trends for any changes in the
storm track north/south that could bring the storm closer to New
England. An example of the trend from the ECMWF AI ensemble (the
most robust ensemble signal so far) is shown below. It's still
dancing a bit, but starting to "lock in" just south of New
England.

ECMWF AI ensemble "model trend" showing how forecasts are
trending over time for a potential Sunday storm over the
Mid-Atlantic.

Compare the ECMWF AI ensemble above with the GFS ensemble below.
Notice the GFS is trending farther south over time and is "now"
more in line with the ECMWF AI ensemble. This trend gives some
weight to Mid-Atlantic solution, but overall the probabilities
for more than 3 inches (what is plotted on these maps) is still
fairly low. With that said, the 50% values in the AI ensemble at
a lead time of 7 days is pretty high! Let's watch and see.

Have a great Monday. We'll take a break from the updates on
Tuesday and check back in on Wednesday.
