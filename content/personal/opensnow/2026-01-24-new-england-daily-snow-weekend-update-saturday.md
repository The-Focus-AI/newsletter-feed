Good Saturday Morning.

It's currently 4:15AM, –30ºF on top of Mt. Washington, with a
windchill of –80ºF. You read that right. Many, many resorts have
updated their socials/websites with "cold holds" for this
morning, especially on upper mountains. Expect limited operations
today as the region battles its coldest weather of the season.

So is it going to snow? Yes.

We are locked in for snow on Sunday afternoon through midday
Monday associated with a large winter storm developing over the
country and re-developing offshore. The only questions are (1)
how far north does the warm nose make it into southern New
England (i.e., sleet concern); (2) does the dry slot punch in to
southwest New England (i.e., shutting down snow early); and (3)
where does the banding set up (i.e., where does the heaviest snow
fall)?

The forecast animation below (from the NAM) highlights both the
warm nose/sleet concern, the dry slot concern, and the heavy
snowfall falling along the Mass Pike on Sunday afternoon/evening.
While the heaviest snowfall rates won't likely make it into
western Massachusetts, southern Vermont, and southern New
Hampshire, they will likely make up for it with none of the
aforementioned concerns and really favorable (fluffy)
snow-to-liquid ratios.

NAM model forecast animation for 7AM Sunday through 7AM Monday.

That snowband is going to produce snowfall rates of 3–4 inches
per hour on Sunday afternoon/evening. Unfortunately, it's only
going to last in any one location for an hour or two. Otherwise,
there will be several hours of 1-inch+ snowfall rates that jack
totals up over a foot. When the snow starts in southern New
England, the roads are going to quickly become snow covered.

Multi-model comparison of the snowband dynamics in play at 4PM
on Sunday over southern New England.

So how much snow? A lot. The OpenSnow PEAKS AI model is
producing widespread 12–18-inch totals across New England with
the slightly farther north track of the low closer to the coast.
This pushes the 8–12-inch band now into northern New England and
introduces some lower, sleet-influenced snow totals along the
south shore. The highest totals will most likely top 18 inches
across the Catskills, Berkshires, southern Greens, hills in
southwest New Hampshire (e.g., Monadnock), and Worcester Hills
region (e.g., Wachusett).

According to the NWS, these totals are in-line with the expected
amounts, but also fairly close to the high-end amounts, implying
there really isn't much room for more snow, but there still is
some room to the downside. Even the downside is for "just" 8–12
inches across the region with slightly lower totals closer to the
Canadian Border.

I will be back for another update on Sunday morning. I have to
jump on a plane right now. I'm off to the Texas for the Annual
Meeting of the American Meteorological Society.
