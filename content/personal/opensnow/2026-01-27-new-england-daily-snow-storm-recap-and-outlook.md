[Written at 6PM on Monday evening]

The snowstorm ending on Monday morning ended up dropping a wide
swath of 12–20 inches totals across New York and New England. The
highest report received from the National Weather Service was
just a bit higher at 22.2 inches in Massachusetts with a whole
slew of 22-inch reports. Note that totals also popped above 18
inches in northern Vermont; these reports were received later in
the day on Monday between 3 and 5 PM.

The highest report from a mountain resort in New England on
Monday morning was at Wachusett with 20 inches of new snow.
Second in line was Waterville Valley at 18 inches. However, as
the day wore on, more and more resorts started adding up
additional amounts from light snow on Monday morning and early
Monday afternoon. We soon saw Sunday River and Mohawk Mountain
also pop 20-inch reports.

I am guessing that Tuesday's resort reports will be a mess. Why?
Some resorts will report single digit amounts for NEW snowfall
from Monday and Monday night, whereas some resort will add the
two together and post a storm-total from Sunday into Tuesday.
Expect to see some funny totals in the list/on the map. With the
18-inch totals in northern Vermont on Monday afternoon, we'll
definitely see central and northern Vermont resorts drop some
good reports on Tuesday morning. Check out the latest reports
from New England here

As for the week ahead, we're still looking at mostly quiet
weather, turning colder with single-digit and teen temperatures.
Additional light snow is likely on Tuesday night and Wednesday
morning, but without a lot of accumulation. Model forecasts,
including the OpenSnow PEAKS AI model, suggest that 1–2 inches is
possible in the Greens. Otherwise, expect a "meaningless" dusting
of snow on top of the foot and half that just fell. I know it's
cold, but conditions are absolutely fantastic; most resorts are
now open at or near 100%.

I am still watching the potential for another coastal storm this
weekend; however, have tempered expectations. The storm track is
once again more out to sea and we'd need to see a significant
trend toward the north and west for widespread heavy snowfall in
central and northern New England. It ended up coming to fruition
last week, so we'll have to wait and see what happens this
weekend. The timing for this storm would be ~7PM Saturday (31
Jan) through 7PM Sunday (1 Feb). As of right now, the best chance
for accumulating snows >3 inches during that period favors
southern New England.

Hope you all are having a wonderful week.
