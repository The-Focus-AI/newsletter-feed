Summary
-------

Winter returns in New England with several rounds of snow
throughout the week. Snow will be mostly light to start the week,
but could end with larger storms into the long weekend.

Short Term Forecast
-------------------

The January thaw has come to an end across most of central and
northern New England with minimal impact to the high-elevation
snowpack across northern Vermont. Temperatures trended lower for
most locations than anticipated; however, locations at lower
elevations in central New England did see a retreat/lowering of
snow depths. Elsewhere, the warm air did soften the snow, so a
return to colder weather may result in hard pack and some icy
spots. I will note that locations in Maine (e.g., Sugarloaf)
faired the best with the most snow (and least rain) over the last
several days.

The Mt. Mansfield snow stake did drop back to 60 inches over the
weekend, but returned to 63 inches on Sunday. The snow depth is
still far above average for this time of year.

Upslope snow showers and snow squalls returned overnight into
Monday morning with accumulations ranging from a dusting to 3
inches across valley locations in central New England to several
inches across the mountains in northern New England. The high
totals included 3.5 inches reported in Woodbury, Vermont and 8-10
inches at Jay Peak; Stowe reported 4 inches.

Snow showers will linger across the mountains on Monday and pick
back up in coverage and intensity primarily in northern Vermont
overnight into Tuesday with the passage of a shortwave trough of
cold air aloft. Total snowfall on Monday night will range from
0–1 inches across most of northern Vermont with 1–3 possible at
higher elevations (mostly at Jay).

NAM model forecast animation for 7AM Monday through 7AM Tuesday.

Additional snow is likely with the passage of a cold front on
Tuesday night; however, again, snowfall accumulations with be
light and likely only 0–1 inches across portions of Vermont and
New Hampshire.

Extended Forecast
-----------------

What we are probably all interested in is what's going to happen
on Wednesday (14 Jan) through the long weekend. Recall that
Monday (19 Jan) is the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday. There are
a few different scenarios all featuring at least some snow.

Most model guidance has a large trough of cold air dropping
south over the Central U.S. and Great Lakes region that sets the
stage for a temperature gradient extending from southwest to
northeast along-ish the Appalachians. This temperature gradient,
along with western North Atlantic moisture, serves as the energy
needed for an East Coast storm and/or Nor'easter (or both) as we
head into the weekend.

It may not be immediately obvious, but the GFS ensemble model
forecast has that large trough of cold air slightly farther west
as compared to the ECMWF ensemble model forecast. This shift can
make all the difference in whether the storm track is along the
coast or out to sea.

The general line up is for light snow over New England with
near-coastal (but onshore) low pressure on Wednesday into
Thursday. The potential for a coastal storm/Nor'easter increases
on Friday as low pressure develops just offshore and likely
tracks toward/south of Maritime Canada. Additional snow is
possible as we head into the weekend with another near-coastal
(but maybe out to sea) region of low pressure on Sunday.

The pattern was always going to be favorable for coastal
mischief; these model-to-model and run-over-run changes teasing
Nor'easters are getting interesting.

What does all this mean for snowfall totals? It's still hard to
say with any confidence.

At Killington 
( https://clicks.opensnow.com/f/a/_XyH_4fT-I2evrDGWt3rwg~~/AAQRxRA~/x4QfvPTeORBmm55hxxevYlYXijfo1cuB22wjSGliQ3PVQ1vkaSLLojCkroffyegHVpFX4A2BFMGHdrqAR0WmPiiUahazcyHixTppKZ7lk8PiiPlJiuwZia-xLdRI-R7dvgfgHfdkZOp3rh1bRx3JFA~~ ), the
model forecast ranges/plumes for total snowfall suggests anywhere
from ~3–7 inches on Thursday and Friday with another ~2–10 inches
possible on Sunday (18 Jan). The increasing forecast range
reflects the increased uncertainty.

A similar story is in the forecast ranges at Sugarloaf 
( https://clicks.opensnow.com/f/a/XtgqtJoRHKMRYrJCSLSQ7w~~/AAQRxRA~/KKochpTQVKVVyxNcSDcTnSktDPnWr7IYEqBxyQ-zlUuCXruJvX7U93NWHk93R0UVuLmk3d1q-VRPEAEd2HAdgm0xbr7fhMYajVyR2urEffPwL5G62PH_LB43LwlRTq1mMGLottMbCFNAUHzBhdqDpA~~ ), where
models range from ~2–5 inches on Thursday and Friday (16 Jan),
but have a higher ceiling on snows for next Sunday (18 Jan).

Overall, there is a lot of uncertainty. If you take the low-end
of the above estimates, we're only talking about ~3–6 inches of
snow through next Monday. If you take the high-end of the above
estimates, we're well over a foot. The ensemble models provide us
with some probabilities largely to temper our expectations.

The ECMWF, GFS, and Canadian Ensemble systems all have >75%
probabilities of more than six inches of snow through next Monday
across the mountains in northern New England. The GFS is really
the only modeling system with probabilities of more than six
inches of snow greater than 20–30% through southern New England.
I would say that this probability mostly also reflects our
"Nor'easter odds". It's worth noting that the AI version of the
ECMWF ensemble is a major buzzkill. I'm cautious here (i.e.,
pessimistic) given the AI model is leaning against the dynamical
models.

We'll find out which models are correct soon enough. Overall,
plan for at least some snow if you're heading out to the
mountains either later this week or for the long weekend.

Thanks for reading and check back all week for updates.

The OpenSnow PEAKS Model

Following 18 months of development, training, and testing, our
new PEAKS model is now live and creating every snow and
precipitation forecast in OpenSnow.

This is included with Free, Base, and Premium 
( https://clicks.opensnow.com/f/a/-gExDkSJvYcwTId3CHMs9Q~~/AAQRxRA~/sitHvftG3dOYATCTwvQmI9fKPuOYvx632u1TMqMQMynbdaXvX20cfiMlt3qWebBNKiJ2JCA1xBEPnVcHCuYnPCy4Gn7yxmDGrfqYTq3TvjSybC9pb-wiOeQXVNPhJUia ) accounts for every snow and
precipitation forecast in the OpenSnow app and website. No action
is needed to view PEAKS and its forecasts.

What is PEAKS?

PEAKS is an AI (machine learning) model that is up to 50% more
accurate in mountain terrain.

PEAKS learns from past storms and transforms normal weather
models (used by other apps) into sharper, more location-specific
forecasts. Learning from past storms is what human meteorologists
do, but unlike humans, PEAKS can forecast for every location on
earth with updates taking only seconds.

Bottom Line: OpenSnow has developed a world-first mountain
forecast model that evaluates past storms to create more accurate
predictions. This should provide you with higher confidence when
searching for your favorite conditions.
