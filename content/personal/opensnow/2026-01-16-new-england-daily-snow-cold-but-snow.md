Summary
-------

The forecast turns colder over the next two weeks with limited
prospects for widespread heavy snowfall. The pattern instead
supports plenty of light, scattered, and upslope snow showers.

Short Term Forecast
-------------------

Colder air has finally moved back into all of New England with
several inches of snow on Thursday and Thursday night. Reports
from the mountains had a large range with anywhere from 0 to 8
inches. The highest reports came from Sugarbush with 6 inches and
Cannon with 8 inches. See all of the reports (and estimates)
below or on the app 
( https://clicks.opensnow.com/f/a/MvhPDL08ZmF6XlFYv5iNjw~~/AAQRxRA~/HWdyDWAClOEHfDdlnhcSJbfph7XKSswXWzk5OX_XX50oz_7MN6JT-zrgi_EXIWYCoZZF9FptNhVgMlpvaAhI49j2NxnrL5hviY7ROG1dx0hwLu-eFP7wucVJBh19K1P_4it53HBNMpQ1IxZoA8ak5U7cqRN0EGjSNgWk_-yBI6JJSvnNzHJGW574Guig8IWp )
.

The return of cold air sets the stage for a somewhat prolonged
period of below normal temperatures across the region through
next week (and beyond) where high temperatures may struggle
through the teens.

In the near-term, strong cold air advection continues behind the
departing storm on Friday driven by a tightening pressure
gradient and northwest flow. No meaningful new snow is expected,
but temperatures will settle in the low 10s with near-zero wind
chills. The snowmaking crews will likely be busy and exposed
lifts will be unpleasant.

A positively tilted upper-level trough and region of weak low
pressure moves in overhead on Friday night into Saturday,
providing weak large-scale lift in an atmosphere with limited
moisture. Light snow will overspread the region overnight with
best chances for accumulating snow by Saturday morning across
northern New England and at higher elevations. Snowfall
accumulations are light, generally a coating to 1–2 inches,
locally higher in the usual upslope favored areas.

Saturday.

Snow continues on Saturday night and Sunday, but will be
primarily driven by upslope westerly flow with accumulations of
~1–3 inches at higher elevations in the Greens, and potentially
into the Whites. The rest of the region will remain cloudy on
Sunday with temperatures hovering in the upper 10s and low 20s.
It should be a great day to hit the slopes.

The coastal storm hype in the forecast for Sunday night has
backed off. Chances for a significant event are not zero, but
they are much closer to zero than 100%. The latest trends have a
weaker storm passing off to the east and offshore on Sunday night
into Monday (19 Jan). The best chance for accumulating snow from
this storm will be on Cape Cod where there are exactly zero
lift-serviced places to ski (last I checked). The ensemble models
suggest that portions of Downeast Maine and near-coastal regions
may yet have a decent shot of a whole inch of snow.

Extended Forecast
-----------------

Beyond Monday (19 Jan), a broad and cold longwave trough mostly*
dominates the eastern half of the U.S., with embedded shortwaves
periodically enhancing snow showers, especially in northern New
England and along the spine of the Green Mountains. Accumulations
are likely to be on the low side (relatively speaking) and more
akin to "upslope refreshers".

*There will be a brief reprieve from this pattern on Friday (23
Jan) and Saturday (24 Jan) where a small window for additional
forcing for more widespread snow may be possible.

its anomaly undulating from 7AM on Monday (19 Jan) through next
Sunday (25 Jan).

Otherwise, the key story in the extended forecast will be
temperatures remaining well below normal, which will bode well
for sustained snowmaking, but not so much for riding open lifts.
At Killington (below), slope side temperatures are expected to
drop to near or below 0F twice and remain below 20F over the next
15 days.
