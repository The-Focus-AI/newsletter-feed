Several inches of snow fell overnight across New England
associated with a weak area of low pressure. The NWS reports so
far this morning were primarily confined to Massachusetts where
~1–3 inches of snow was reported.

NWS snowfall reports as of 7:30AM on Thursday.

The CoCoRaHS reports were a bit more widespread across the
region with local amounts topping out closer to 4 inches in
Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Maine.

CoCoRaHS snowfall reports as of 7:30AM on Thursday.

Finally, the resorts checked in on Thursday morning with
anywhere from 1–5 inches, the highest out of Bromley in southern
Vermont.

OpenSnow snowfall reports (and estimates) as of 7:30AM on
Thursday.

While these inches are great and I'm sure everyone is loving the
fresh cover, the main question is what's going on this weekend?
There will be a massive storm across the U.S. and it looks like
it will impact portions of New England.

Side note: Don't forget it is still going to be very, very cold
on Saturday. High temperatures will not get above 0F on Saturday
and the windchill will be below –20F. Many resorts will take
action with limited operations to limit cold exposure. I already
saw on X that Jay Peak postponed

some of their planned activities. The NWS has issued an "extreme
cold watch" for much of northern New England. The text from the
extreme cold watch out of Burlington's NWS office is screenshot
below.

The main players this weekend include a "cutoff low" west of
Baja that will eject eastward over Mexico on Friday (23 Jan). The
cutoff will sync up with the Arctic high pressure and a bowling
ball of cold air dropping south over the U.S. and produce a large
widespread region of wintry precipitation on Saturday (24 Jan).
As this storm transitions to the East Coat it will intensify and
bring snowfall to New England on Sunday (25 Jan) and Monday (26
Jan). Last night's 06Z run of the GFS Model is shown below to set
the stage.

GFS Model forecast animation for 7AM Saturday morning through
7PM Monday evening.

Note that the Air Force 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron
(aka the "Hurricane Hunters") flew the cutoff low west of
California last night. They dropped "dropsondes" –– the same as
weather balloons without the balloon, but with parachutes –– to
collect information for the models. These observations went into
the 00Z model suite last night with some memory of those
observations transferring into the later runs today. They will
fly again today (Thursday) over the Pacific and with the NOAA
contingent over the Gulf. I get to help plan these flights as
part of my day job.

Map of the 500-mb (middle-atmospheric) flow, wind, and it's
vorticity/spin over the North Pacific last night at 00Z Thursday.
The track of the Hurricane Hunters is in black with squares
denoting the dropsonde observations of the cutoff low.

The GFS trends over the last several runs have shifted the band
of heaviest snow into southern New England with 2-day totals on
Sunday and Monday across Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Southeast
Massachusetts. The animation below shows snowfall with a
snow-to-liquid ratio of 10:1 and totals topping out near a foot.
One problem. The snow-to-liquid ratios will likely be 13:1 to
18:1 implying that snowfall totals may top out near 10–20 inches
if this forecast holds. This forecast would be bring more 6
inches into portions of central New England; however, any trends
back to the south would drop these totals.

GFS Model trends (last 4 runs) for 48-hour snowfall 7AM Sunday
to 7AM Tuesday.

The ECMWF model trends are locked in and favor that band of
heaviest snow even farther north than the GFS model. The heaviest
snow out of the ECMWF model is oriented along the Mass Pike with
10–20-inch totals likely well into portions of southern Vermont
and New Hampshire. Also note the maps below using that
snow-to-liquid ratio of 10:1 and our ratios will be much (much)
fluffier.

ECMWF Model trends (last 4 runs) for 48-hour snowfall 7AM Sunday
to 7AM Tuesday.

We will continue to see the models jump around in location and
intensity. The best bet right now is to expect fresh snow on
Sunday and Monday with totals of at least 3–6 inches for a good
portion of southern and central New England. There exists the
possibility (a really good one) for more than a foot for a large
portion of New England, especially over southern New England
favoring resorts in the Berkshires. Stay tuned.
