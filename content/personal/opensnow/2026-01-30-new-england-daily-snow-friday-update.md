The weekend is almost here and everyone wants to know what to
expect for conditions over the next few days. The overall
consensus among mountain reports is that the snow is absolutely
fantastic, but the temperatures are and will be cold. Groomers
are great and natural slopes are a bit mogul-ed, but otherwise,
everything is skiing and riding at or near 100%.

The Mt. Mansfield snow stake is now at a depth of 75 inches.
That is now "average" for the deepest the snow pack usually gets
on top of Mt. Mansfield in late March (see below). Everything
from here on out implies that the deepest snowpack is firmly
"above average" for the heart of the early Spring season. The
snow depth is still just fourth all-time for late January and if
the season ended today, there would still be many years with more
snow. If we remain at fourth all-time, then the snow pack will
continue to climb toward 100 inches by late March and early
April.

As alluded to earlier, the primary weather conditions for the
weekend will be the cold. Add on a bit of a northerly and
northwesterly breeze, and we're looking at windchill temperatures
below 0ºF across the region on both Saturday and Sunday. The
weather snapshot through Monday is shown below at Stowe. Bring
the extra layer.

We are (were?) tracking a snowstorm coming up the coast for
Sunday and Monday; however, it looks like the models have finally
caved toward a mostly out-to-sea solution relative to New
England. Some snow may still be possible over Southeast New
England, Cape Cod, and far eastern Maine, but the rest of the
region will remain dry. It really is a shame, because this storm
will be a beast.

ECMWF model forecast of a mostly out-sea-storm on Sunday into
Monday.

With the close shave along the coast, the ECMWF ensemble is
still suggesting three or more inches may be possible (~50%) over
Cape Cod. The other ensemble models now contain probabilities of
three or more inches below 20% over the region.

The next "best" chance for snowfall around the region appears to
be centered around 6–8 February, next Saturday and Sunday. The
ECMWF ensemble grid for 24-hour snow is shown below for Rutland
and centered on 7–8 February; however, the pattern shares
additional support from the GFS ensemble.

We also see this signal for snow, albeit a little bit earlier on
6–7 Feb, in the 12-hour snowfall from the OpenSnow forecast
ranges tool at resorts such as Killington, shown below. It's
something to look forward to and track as we head into next week.

Have a great Friday. Please look for an update over the weekend,
most likely on Sunday morning.
