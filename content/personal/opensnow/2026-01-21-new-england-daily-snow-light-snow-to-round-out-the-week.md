Summary
-------

Many locations will pick up some light snow through Friday (23
Jan) before the mercury drops out of the thermometer on Saturday
(24 Jan). Big snows are likely a miss on Sunday (25 Jan) into
Monday (26 Jan), but the trend may be our friend?

Short Term Forecast
-------------------

The weather on Tuesday was mostly clear across New England with
some occasional snow showers across portions of the Greens and
Whites. Clouds were quick to clear out overnight with another
display of the Northern Lights and starry skies. Jay Peak is
pictured below around 8PM (Tuesday).

If you look closely, you can see the snowcats grooming at
Sugarloaf under the northern lights in the video/animation below.

The weather will continue to be relatively quiet as far as
"storms" go through the rest of the week, but we will have
widespread scattered snow showers and some persistent upslope
snow showers in the Greens on deck starting on Wednesday night
and heading through to Friday. The more widespread snows will
shutdown on Thursday morning, but some isolated upslope in the
Greens will continue into Friday night.

GFS model forecast animation for 7AM Wednesday through 7PM
Friday

Overall snowfall totals through Friday evening will stack to 3–6
inches across the higher terrain in the Greens and Whites. The
valleys across the Northeast Kingdom into far northern New
Hampshire will also likely see totals in the 3–6-inch range. The
highest totals (if you look at the actual numbers) fall from
Bolton to Jay in the northern Greens with a "high forecast" of 7
inches at Smuggs.

Extended Forecast
-----------------

There are two things to focus on in the extended forecast: (1)
cold, and (2) snow chances Sunday (25 Jan) into Monday (26 Jan).

First, it's going to be cold on Saturday. Very cold.

Temperatures on Saturday morning will struggle to get above
–10ºF with windchill temperatures likely down near –20ºF to
–40ºF. Definitely plan on bringing the extra layers, the "good"
gloves, and the hand warmers. I would imagine that resorts may
delay upper (open-air) lifts if this forecast verifies. They will
want to do some cold exposure mitigation at these hazardous
levels.

Temperatures moderate some into Sunday, but will still be near
zero with below-zero windchills across the upper mountains in
northern New England. I've opted to show Killington below as an
example. Dress warm.

The moderation in temperatures on Sunday comes with an increased
chance of snow as a low-latitude storm track potentially shifts
just far enough north to impact the region. It's definitely going
to snow across the Eastern U.S. this upcoming weekend and into
early next week, but likely to our south. This one will hurt
seeing 1–2-foot totals from Oklahoma to Virginia, or slightly
farther north if the latest trends hold.

ECMWF total snowfall accumulation forecast through Monday 26
January, animated from 1PM Friday through 7AM Monday.

Note at the end of the forecast animation above where snowfall
"bumps" up into southern New England. That's our "ECMWF chance"
at some snowfall out of this southern storm track. From an
ensemble perspective, latest model guidance is for a ~10–70%
chance of 3 or more inches across southern New England,
increasing toward the coast and out of the region offshore and
into the Mid-Atlantic. Unless a significant trend north happens
over the next couple days, a big storm is not in the cards for
most of New England's mountains. Read on for hopium.

Overnight trends (i.e., from Tuesday 20 Jan into Wednesday 21
Jan) across the modeling suite were for a bit more of a northward
track which would bring some additional confidence in potential
accumulations into portions of central New England. Let's see how
this pans out.

Thanks for reading. The next New England Daily Snow will be
posted on Friday, unless an update is warranted on Thursday due
to those model trends. Stay tuned.
