Summary
-------

A cold front and possible region of low pressure on Wednesday
night and Thursday shifts rain to snow across northern New
England, with accumulations of 3 to 6 inches in the mountains.
Colder air settles in late week with lingering snow showers and
improving snowmaking conditions.

Short Term Forecast
-------------------

We have a complicated forecast ahead with most of New England
seeing both rain and snow through the weekend. I will break down
different aspects of the forecast chronologically and hit the
highlights relevant to the forecast.

Wednesday

Any precipitation on Wednesday is driven by residual warm air
advection ahead of a weak shortwave trough passing north of the
region, resulting in scattered rain showers. With southerly flow
and above-freezing temperatures firmly in place, precipitation is
mostly rain at lower elevations; however, some snow may fall near
the Canadian Border and in the highest elevations in the northern
Greens and Whites, especially later in the day after last chair.

NAM model forecast for 7AM to 7PM on Wednesday.

Wednesday night and early Thursday

There are two players (i.e., ingredients) in the forecast for
Wednesday night and early Thursday.

The first player is a deepening mid-level trough of cold air
aloft and strengthening low-level temperature gradient that will
lead to more organized forcing for precipitation across northern
and central New England on Wednesday night and early Thursday.
Precipitation will start as rain, but an advancing cold front and
strong cold air advection will result in a northwest-to-southeast
changeover to snow. There is some uncertainty is when and how
quickly this cold front will pass through the region.

Thursday Night.

The second player is a developing region of low pressure that
will track across/through New England out ahead of the first
player. Will they merge? Maybe.

Will the storm track farther west, slow down the progression of
the cold front with the first player and bring more rain into
portions of the coastal plain? Maybe.

Will the storm be weaker and/or track farther east, allowing for
the cold front with the first player to move through quicker, but
with overall less precipitation? Maybe.

The animation below shows 19 different model forecasts all valid
at 1AM Wednesday Night. Take your pick.

Wednesday night.

How much snow?

Snowfall will be highest where the cold air arrives earliest and
best forcing for precipitation overlaps longest, particularly
across the northern Adirondacks and northern Greens, with
orographic enhancement favoring 3–6 inches at Jay, Stowe, and
Killington among others.

In the Whites and western Maine mountains, including Sugarloaf,
precipitation likely falls as snow with accumulations closer to
2–4 inches, though total amounts depend on how quickly the
surface low lifts north especially in Maine.

Across valleys and parts of central New England, snowfall totals
depend on how much snow falls behind the cold front on Wednesday
night (which is likely not a lot; i.e., 1–2 inches).

Thursday and Friday

As the surface low lifts into northern Maine and Quebec, strong
cold air advection and increasing westerly flow will lead to a
final transition to snow showers before precipitation tapers.
Upslope flow maintains snow showers the longest across the Greens
and Whites with an additional 1–3 inches possible between 2PM
Thursday and 2PM Friday. Thereafter, confidence is high that
impacts shift from snowfall to cold, with wind chills across
northern New England dropping below 0F into Friday (see
Killington's forecast below the snowfall map).

Extended Forecast
-----------------

A broad trough of cold air settles across the Eastern U.S.
through the long weekend (17–19 Jan) and into early next week,
keeping temperatures well below normal across New England.
Northwest low-level flow within this pattern favors persistent
upslope clouds and scattered snow showers across the Green
Mountains, Whites, and occasionally western Maine. This pattern
is overall consistent with a more active storm track that is
shunted well offshore and out-to-sea.

its anomaly for 7AM Saturday (17 Jan) through 7PM Tuesday (20
Jan).

Throughout this period, small disturbances rotating through the
trough will briefly enhance snow showers, especially near the
Canadian Border and along higher terrain in the Greens and
Whites. Overall snowfall will be light but steady in favored
upslope areas, but temperatures will remain cold enough for
efficient snowmaking elsewhere (see Killington below).

The ensemble forecast guidance suggests the pattern will likely
undergo a slight regime transition as we head past 20 January
into the following weekend. This transition will likely feature a
re-development of the trough of cold air farther west over the
central U.S. allowing for more "normal" or "above normal"
temperatures to creep back into New England. While the transition
increases our chances of snapping the cold streak with a warm
storm, it could also increase our chances at seeing a larger
snowstorm.

its anomaly for 7PM next Monday (19 Jan) through 7PM next Friday
(23 Jan).

Thanks for reading! Please look for the next update on Thursday
morning with the latest forecast trends.
