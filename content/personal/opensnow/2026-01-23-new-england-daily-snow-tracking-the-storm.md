The forecast remains on track for a very cold day of skiing and
riding on Saturday. Temperatures will drop below 0F on Friday
evening and remain below 0F through Sunday morning. They will
likely bottom out somewhere between –10F and –20F across the
region with windchill values to –40F (or –40C, same thing). The
cold weather will likely impact operations at resorts across the
region, so be prepared for upper lift closures and limited
operations.

Temperatures will hover near 0F with windchill temperatures
remaining below –10F on Sunday with increasing clouds ahead of
the snowstorm. The storm likely starts producing snow on Sunday
afternoon from south-southwest to north-northeast. Snow
continues, heavy at times especially across southern New England,
through Monday evening.

The highest snowfall totals will fall across portions of
southern and central New England where a combination of optimal
forcing and high snow-to-liquid ratios pump out 1–2-inch per hour
snowfall rates on Sunday night. Higher rates seem possible as a
very strong band of frontogenesis crosses southern and coastal
New England between ~4PM Sunday and 4AM Monday.

Sunday through 4AM Monday.

There is still some wiggle room in the exact track of the storm,
its intensity, and the location of this "mega band" that will
traverse southern New England. Some models suggest that a dry
slot may even punch into southwest New England and sleet as a
possibility, effectively knocking back totals during the second
half of the storm.

Multi-model comparison of where a strong snowband may occur at
7PM on Sunday evening.

Overall precipitation totals from the different models are
1.0–1.2 inches in southern New England, 0.5–1.0 inch through
central Vermont, central New Hampshire, and southern Maine, and
~0.25–0.50 inches across northern Vermont and New Hampshire.

Multi-model comparison of 48-hour precipitation ending at 7PM on
Monday.

Snow-to-liquid ratios will generally range from 15:1 to 20:1 at
the onset of this storm in southern New England before likely
dropping closer to 12:1. Most of central and northern New England
should remain somewhere near 15:1 to 18:1 for the duration of the
event. This translates into three-ish bands of snow totals
topping out near 12–18"+ in southern New England, 12" through
central New England, and 6–10" in northern Vermont and New
Hampshire.

Based on latest model guidance, the "jackpot" may occur in the
Berkshires and southern Greens where the OpenSnow PEAKS AI model
has 18"+. Outside of New England there is also 18"+ totals from
the Poconos through Catskills and downwind of Lake Ontario. For
some numbers, Jiminy Peak (Berkshires) has 0.5" to 1.2" inch per
hour snowfall rates with a snow-to-liquid ratio (SLR) between
16:1 and 18:1 from 2PM Sunday through 3AM Monday. That's a fluff
bomb.

Now we wait. The forecast totals are already pretty high, so
don't expect them to go up much more. Totals near or over two
feet would really only happen with that mega band and some
coastal enhancement across far southern New England, but only if
the storm doesn't get too close. If the storm jogs a bit more
northwest, upslope in the Berkshires and southern Greens could
also do it.

There is still room for these numbers to go slightly up or
noticeably down depending on the overall evolution of the storm.
In other words, failure modes still exist for low-end
verification, but I remain optimistic (mostly because I'm headed
out of town and will miss the storm locally). The boom and bust
scenarios (through Monday morning) from the National Weather
Service are shown below. Note that since these maps end at 7AM
Monday morning there is still the opportunity for a few more
inches on top of these boom/bust totals.
