2025-2026 Winter Update, Long-Range Outlook
*******************************************

As of mid-January, the winter of 2025-2026 has been a rough one
across much of the Western United States. However, it has been an
excellent season across the Canadian Rockies and Eastern North
America. In this article, we take a look at the winter so far and
offer some thoughts on what the second half of the season may
hold, including comparisons to another similar winter, 2017-2018.

PowSlayer Freeride Kit
**********************

It’s a bold goal to make the best better.

Over the past 13 years, Patagonia’s PowSlayer series has earned
a near mythical status among those seeking the steepest, deepest
powder in the biggest mountains. These aren't the ones bragging
at the end of the day; they are the ones who let their tracks do
the talking, who start before sunrise and leave behind lines as
proud as they are nameless.

The new PowSlayer Freeride Kit is built for those riders.

West Remains Dry, Cold Pattern with Light Snow for the East
***********************************************************

The West will remain stuck in a dry pattern aside from
occasional flurries for the eastern slopes of the Continental
Divide. Cold air will persist across the East with light snow
chances, but no major storms are expected over the next 5 days.
After January 20, snow chances return to the Northwest & Northern
Rockies, while the Northeast will stay in a cold pattern with
increased snow chances.

Utah's Powder Promise
*********************

Utah averages 24 powder days per season—defined as 12" or more
snow falling within 24 hours at any resort. Factor in that 10 of
those resorts are within an hour of Salt Lake City International
Airport, and you’ve found yourself a fast track to The Greatest
Snow on Earth®.

Japan: Have you booked your flight yet?
***************************************

Japanuary is on, and the storms are lining up for the next ten
days. Northern Honshu and Hokkaido will be the focus for the next
several days before a major storm cycle begins on Honshu next
week. Hokkaido will continue to get good snow during this cycle
as well, so if you were wondering when to pull the trigger for
that Japan trip, now is the time.
