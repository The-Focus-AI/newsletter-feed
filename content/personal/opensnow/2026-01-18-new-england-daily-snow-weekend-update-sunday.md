Recap of Saturday

Snow on Saturday ended up coming in a bit stronger than
anticipated – well, at least stronger than *I* anticipated. Most
of the forcing for the snowfall ended up focused across portions
of central and southwest New England where >8 inches of snow was
reported in southern Vermont and the Berkshires. Many other
valley and mountain locations also notched >4 inch totals across
the region.

NWS snowfall reports received during the last 24 hours. [link

Sunday Forecast

A lot of eyes are on the next storm that will be traveling north
along the coast. The storm itself (i.e., it's region of low
pressure) will mostly stay offshore; however, the western edge of
snowfall will track along mid-Atlantic and southern New England
coastlines throughout the day in two "waves". The first wave is
along a decaying frontal boundary and the second wave is the new
near-coastal storm. The evolution of this storm according to the
NAM3K model is shown below.

NAM model forecast animation for 7AM Sunday through 7AM Monday.

The NAM model forecast evolution does a fairly good job at
represented where and how far north the snow is expected across
New England. This storm is really a southern New England special
with limited snow expected across portion of western/northern New
England. I will caveat that by saying that some portions of New
Hampshire and coastal Maine may be just close enough to the
action to see snow, but Vermont is likely going to miss out.

Total snowfall on Sunday into Sunday night will likely top out
between 3–6 inches over eastern Massachusetts and south of
Boston. Totals will decrease points north and west. In terms of
local resorts, Wachusett is likely looking at 2–4 inches and Blue
Hills is likely looking at 3–4 inches. Perfect for some fresh
tracks and holiday skiing on Monday.

The Patriots game in Foxborough on Sunday is likely also looking
at some snow. Game time will run from 3PM to 6PM with light snow
expected before and during the game, potentially mixing with rain
as temperatures hover right around 32F. The heaviest snow,
according to our OpenSnow PEAKS AI model and the NWS models, will
likely fall after the game from 7PM to 12AM.

The forecast remains relatively "unremarkable" as we head into
next week. The main weather focus will be on colder temperatures,
scattered snow showers in westerly upslope flow occasionally
enhanced by a passing trough aloft, and ideal conditions for
snowmaking,

Enjoy your Sunday. The next DailySnow will be posted on Monday
morning.

Go Pats.
