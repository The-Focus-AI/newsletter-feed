The tricky forecast that we were following for New England did,
in fact, diverge slightly from consensus. Rain did go over to
snow on Wednesday night across the region; however, the low
pressure responsible for the rain ended up going farther west
than anticipated. As a result, we saw a little more rain, a
little less snow, and the cold air was a little slower to arrive.

Weather Company.

Nonetheless, we did see accumulating snow at elevation,
especially in Vermont, with 2–6 inches of snow reported by
resorts

Thursday morning. Topping the list was 6 inches at Sugarbush a
several 4-inch reports at Bolton, Okemo, Waterville, Mount Snow,
and others.

Snow will slowly taper off across the region on Thursday with
little additional accumulations outside of the Greens and Whites.
In the mountains, upslope flow will lead to an additional 1–3
inches of snow through Friday morning.

NAM model forecast animation for 7AM Thursday through 7AM
Friday.

Models were teasing a Sunday/Monday snowstorm for southern New
England and we'll take a closer look at that forecast in the
Friday New England Daily Snow.
