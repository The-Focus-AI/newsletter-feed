My schedule will not permit me to make an update on Monday
morning, so I am writing this New England Daily Snow late on
Sunday night (10PM CT/11PM ET).

Snow has been falling hard and fast across southern New England
on Sunday with totals by ~11PM on Sunday well over a foot across
a large swath of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.
Totals greater than six inches extended far into central Vermont
and New Hampshire with snow still ongoing.

The snowfall reports from the National Weather Service as I saw
them at ~11PM on Sunday can be found below with the latest
available here 
( https://clicks.opensnow.com/f/a/_2-9Fyl2If3lT7cBAEMPVQ~~/AAQRxRA~/Eq-kO3rwyyGuIE12BZwCZUQjR6LZho3o59iOQLw3KuPO0CYXBaBnr7NPVsCPYzJlFEZ-U8yweWCbeKz8nyZqG547OoccVPYd2GIUe5AvZ82swaw81jE3-Y0JdDESSBy_F09_LaLXsSqJVwRJaY3kFcF_rW1rkeLk5U5pEVlX4ThTOUoSYW_8SaduEBZbJYcxEHqk08VmEy_tV8CKBpER3w~~ )
. The highest reports in New England were located in Ludlow and
New Braintree, Massachusetts with 18–19 inches. There were also a
pair of 18-inch reports in Eastford and Simsbury, Connecticut.
These totals no doubt increased overnight with snow continuing to
fall across New England.

NWS snowfall reports across the Northeast U.S. as of ~11PM ET on
Sunday night.

The bulk of the heaviest snow is slowly coming to an end across
portions of the region on Sunday night as the dry slot of the
storm advances into southwest New England. The heaviest snow is
likely offshore by the time most of you read this post on Monday
morning.

Weather Company.

With totals currently sitting between 12–20 inches across
southern New England as of 11PM on Sunday night, I expect storm
totals to push toward 2 feet at several locations along I-90 in
Massachusetts. Resorts in the Berkshires and in the Worcester
hills (Wachusett) will likely check in on Monday morning with
16–24-inch totals and resorts in southern Vermont will also top 1
foot. A full list of the New England snowfall reports (updated
automatically) can be found here 
( https://clicks.opensnow.com/f/a/hcAeFyniRoSrqW_DadmMEQ~~/AAQRxRA~/2FfhoD9jHkQSmZ2irX0rwMiXjfASEQhqsGfk1vPWPJrTFE_zancuSB0BJlsO-O7BAZqCZ8I4_8kWnsSh0qrnJUX60TVZvz2OXnnbFFkU9Io58L7xHnVQXy7v4_Zi0VKZ5kMrUYY24Gfu2-U2Nvh4yg~~ ).

Snow will linger across New England on Monday as a trough aloft
will a re-enhance light snow into Monday night. We likely won't
add significantly to totals already on the ground across southern
New England, but some locations, especially across the Vermont
and New Hampshire could pick up an additional 2–5 inches of snow,
especially in the Greens and Whites.

HRRR model forecast animation for 7AM Monday through 1AM Monday
Night.

The week ahead is looking fairly quiet once the snows back off
on Monday night. With the exception of some light snow and very
minimal accumulations expected on Tuesday night into Wednesday,
the main focus of the forecast will be on the continuation and/or
cooling back off of temperatures as we head toward next weekend.
High temperatures according to the ECMWF model in Central Vermont
(Rutland) and in western Maine (Sugarloaf) are expected to drop
back to near 0–10F through Friday (30 Jan). You'll want to dress
in layers and bring the gator if you're planning on taking
advantage of the fresh snow.

My schedule is quite variable this week while I'm on travel. I
will do my best to queue up or post updates as best as possible.
I apologize that I was not able to snapshot the storm totals in
my post here on Monday morning (queued up from late Sunday
night), but I will capture the totals in my next update late
Monday night or Tuesday morning.

Enjoy the day!
