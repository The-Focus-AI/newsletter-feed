We are watching a beauty of a storm develop over the western
North Atlantic and track off the Eastern Seaboard on Sunday. This
storm was responsible for quasi-generational snows across
portions of the Carolinas, but will unfortunately miss New
England wide right.

ECMWF model forecast animation for 1AM Sunday through 7AM Monday
(2 Feb).

The storm is on its way to Newfoundland, leaving New England
with sunshine and breezy north winds. Temperatures will remain in
the single digits across the region with windchills down below
0F. Snow conditions remain fantastic with most resorts operating
at near 100%, including most glades. Temperatures should remain
warm enough, and winds low enough, to keep lifts spinning on
Sunday.

The week ahead is looking fairly quiet on the East Coast. Some
(very) light snow will be possible on Wednesday (4 Feb) as a weak
area of low pressure dissipates on approach from southeast
Canada. I would be surprised if snow totals topped 1–2 inches
anywhere in northern New England.

The next best chance of snowfall will arrive on Friday and lasts
through the weekend with several of the 24-hour periods in there
(e.g., Friday into Saturday, and Saturday into Sunday) featuring
enhanced probabilities of more than 1 inch of snow according to
the ECMWF ensemble.

ECMWF ensemble model forecast animation for the probability of
>1 inch of snow in the 24-hour periods ending at 1PM Friday (6
Feb) through 7PM Sunday (8 Feb).

In terms of snowfall at any one location, the ECMWF ensemble
suggests that this second, next best chance, snow event will
likely only be a 1–3-inch event over next weekend at Rutland (for
example). We may be able to squeeze an additional inch or two at
higher elevations, but it otherwise looks like a continuation of
the relatively quiet conditions into mid-February.

Behind this next storm, the models suggest that temperatures
will drop again below 0F on Sunday (8 Feb) and moderate into
mid-February. We may even see some North Country locations tick
above freezing, maybe.

I hope everyone is enjoying their weekend. Please look for the
next update on Monday morning.
