Happy Wednesday.

The weather is now quiet for the time being with high pressure
off to our west and low pressure off to our east. As a result, we
are stuck in a west-northwest to north flow pattern that is
rather devoid of moisture. Some snow showers may be possible
across the northern mountains, but otherwise we're just locked in
with relatively cold temperatures through to the weekend. Valley
highs will likely settle somewhere near 10F across the North
Country through Saturday with overnight lows below 0F.

The big question remains as to whether or not a developing storm
across the Southeast U.S. and western North Atlantic will impact
New England. The forecast models remain largely consistent with
an average track that is offshore with primary impacts to far
southeast New England (e.g., Rhode Island/Boston/Cape Cod);
however, there still exists the potential for some snow and wind
across portions of central New England on Sunday (1 February)
into Monday (2 February).

GFS model forecast animation for 1AM Sunday through 4AM Sunday
Night/Monday.

Similar to previous forecast runs, the ensemble models paint a
picture of >70% probability of more than three inches of snow
primarily across far southeast New England for the 24-hour period
ending at 1AM on Monday 2 February. The probabilities of more
than three inches of snow drops to under 30–50% by the time you
reach portions of southeast New Hampshire.

I'll keep an eye on the forecast trends, but right now this
still looks like an unfortunate close shave with only one ECMWF
ensemble member producing more than 2 inches of snow (at the
moment) in central Vermont. The next window for light snow over
New England likely opens after 6 Feb.

With my travel schedule and the quiet weather, I am likely going
to take the day off on Thursday. Please look for the next Daily
Snow on Friday. Have a good one!
