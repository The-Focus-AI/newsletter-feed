Perfect Pairings Just Next Door!

** Château Pegau Côtes du Rhône Blanc — France
Château Pegau is a family-run estate celebrated for traditional, terroir-driven wines. Cuvée Lône Blanc reflects this philosophy in a beautifully approachable style, providing texture, warmth, and balance.  Ripe pear, yellow apple, and white peach with hints of honeysuckle, herbs, and almond. Medium-bodied, rounded, and gently savory - $22.99

Bourgogne Passetoutgrain 2023 — France.
This is an  appellation, not a single estate, blending Pinot Noir and Gamay, reflecting the region’s tradition of fresh, everyday wines made for the table.  Classic Burgundy limestone and clay bring lift, finesse, and subtle earthiness with notes of red cherry, cranberry, and wild strawberry with gentle spice, dried herbs, and a hint of forest floor. Light to medium-bodied, silky, and vibrant. - $26.99

Shania Verdejo 0.0%
A thoughtfully crafted non-alcoholic Verdejo by the Gil family of Bodegas Juan Gil (est. 1916), retaining freshness, aromatics, and structure.  Citrus peel, green apple, white peach, and subtle herbal notes with a clean, refreshing finish.  A bright, palate-cleansing option alongside the meal — or a stand-alone pour during Damp or Dry January. - $18.99
