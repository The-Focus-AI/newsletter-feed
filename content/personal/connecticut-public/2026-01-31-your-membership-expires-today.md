Your valued — and vital! — support of Connecticut Public expires today.

Your support is the foundation upon which every story, conversation, and program
rests.

We tell thousands of memorable and inspiring stories each year. From the
headlines of All Things Considered and PBS News Hour ... to the discoveries of American Experience and Finding Your Roots . From the drama of All Creatures Great and Small , Astrid , and Miss Scarlett and the Duke ... to the thought-provoking conversations of The Colin McEnroe Show and Where We Live .

The need to understand each other and the challenges we face is essential.
That's why your renewed membership is critical.

RENEW

Donations to Connecticut Public have a powerful impact for good. But we don’t do
this work alone. We need you today.

We know you count on Connecticut Public — and we want you to know we’re counting
on you. Stick by our side and renew right now.

With my thanks and gratitude,
Brendan Foley
Senior Director, Membership
