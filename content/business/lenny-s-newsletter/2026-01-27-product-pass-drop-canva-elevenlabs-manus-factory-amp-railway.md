👋  Hey there, I’m Lenny. Each week, I answer reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career. For more: Lenny’s Podcast  | How I AI  | Lennybot  | Lenny’s Reads  | Favorite AI and PM courses  | Favorite communication course 
I’m excited to welcome seven new premium partners to the Lenny’s Newsletter Product Pass —bringing the total value of your paid newsletter subscription to over $25,000.
→ Already a paid subscriber? Grab your free products here .
→ Not yet a subscriber? Subscribe  and then grab your free products here .
My goal with the Product Pass  is to get you to actually experience the most important, cutting-edge, beautifully crafted products for yourself: to stop scrolling and start building.
As I’ve said before, there’s a growing divide (in terms of career opportunities, financial outcomes, loving your job) between the people who embrace these magical new tools and benefit from them, and those who stay business-as-usual and get left behind. My mission is to make sure you’re in that first group.
Your paid subscription gets you access to the world’s most popular product newsletter , podcast , and global product community  (with local meetups, mentorship programs, AMAs, and more), and now, also the entire stack of tools you need to become an AI-native builder—for just $200-$350 a year.
This collection includes only products that I love, and have carefully handpicked. There are dozens of companies that have asked to join this bundle that I’m holding off on, to get you the highest concentration of goodness. Every quarter (or so), we’ll continue rotating products in and out so that we can keep this collection fresh and awesome.
Many readers expense this subscription out of their workplace’s learning and development budget. Here’s an email you can send to your manager . These deals are exclusively provided to subscribers of this newsletter—you won’t find anything like this anywhere else.
Subscribe here , and grab your free products here . See offer details below for full terms and conditions (please read before subscribing).
What are the new products?

1. Manus —1 year free of Manus, with 4,000 credits per month ($240 value)

Production debugging: Amp connects to Sentry, pulls stack traces, traces bugs across multiple code paths, and ships fixes. What used to be hours of log-diving becomes a single thread.
Automated browser testing: Amp runs through user flows in a real browser—sign-in, forms, checkout—takes screenshots, and writes tests that verify behavior. No manual QA scripts required.
Research-then-build workflows: Need to integrate a new API or library? Amp reads the docs, finds examples, and implements. It knows when to search the web and when to write code.

How do I get access to these free products?
Become an Annual  or Insider  subscriber and then grab your codes here .
If I’m already a paid subscriber, do I get access to the products?
Yep! The same rules below apply to both new and existing subscribers.
What’s the difference between the Annual and Insider tiers?
Since we don’t have unlimited free product codes, we occasionally run out of the more popular products. To address this, we introduced an Insider tier:
Insider-tier subscribers  ($350/year) get priority access to all available products—we set aside a dedicated pool of codes for this tier. Some products (like Canva Business, ElevenLabs, and Lovable) are exclusively available to Insiders.
Annual subscribers  ($200/year) get general access to the majority of products (currently, 16 out of 23) on a first-come, first-serve basis. We do our best to get plenty of codes, but once they’re gone, they’re gone.
You can always check the current status of all available products here . Monthly subscribers do not get access to these products. 
Note: The Insider subscription gives you priority access to all available products. The previous iteration of the Insider tier guaranteed access to every product. If you became an Insider prior to 1/24/26, you are still guaranteed access to every product in our collection until those deals expire (typically six months after launch). New Insider subscribers get priority access—meaning you’ll get front-of-the-line access to every product, and we set aside a dedicated pool of codes for this tier. In practice, you’ll almost certainly get every product you want, along with Insider-only exclusive products. We made this change because some of the newer products in the collection weren’t able to give us enough codes to cover every single Insider indefinitely, and we’d rather include these products in the bundle than not. 
If you have questions or run into any issues, send us an email at support@lennyrachitsky.com [ mailto:support@lennyrachitsky.com ].
What else should I know before I subscribe?
You must be a new customer of the products to take advantage of the free year. If you’ve already paid for one of the products before (monthly or yearly) or redeemed one of our offer codes for that product, you won’t be able to get a free additional year of that product.
We may run out of codes for a product. Your code is only secured once you claim it . You need to claim each code individually, so hop on the products you are most excited about. Insider-tier subscribers get priority access, so if you want to reduce your stress levels, become an Insider .
All sales are final. We won’t issue a refund if any products are out by the time you claim them. The deal is already so good, even if a couple of products are unavailable. If you request a chargeback for your subscription, all of your codes will be deactivated.
The product offers in the current collection will expire six months from this launch (on July 27th). This gives us room to rotate new products in and out of the collection. Make sure to redeem the deals before they expire.
I can’t wait to hear about what you build with these products. 
Enjoy!

Lenny 👋
