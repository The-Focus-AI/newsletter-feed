Hey Will,

I lost a lot of money in 2021.

At the time, NFTs were HOT. Oh man, were people making money
flipping NFTs.

NFTs were the future!

I was convinced. A lot of us were. Maybe you were too.

I was so deep in the Twitter threads and hanging out in Discord
servers with the most juvenile names imaginable, all to get an
edge.

I wanted alpha.

my prized possession
But I never really got that alpha. I never had the best
information at the best time—I had secondhand information that
people wanted me to have because the people with the best
information needed punks like me to be a step behind.*

*Highly recommend reading Crypto Confidential (
https://400c164b.click.convertkit-mail2.com/mvu2mp338ec5hq2rdqqhmhr22m2qqf3hwd9zq/7qh7h8h9d55p4ocz/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzRybjRSTFA=
) if you dabbled during this time.

I'm in the future now, and I didn't make any money on NFTs. I
never use NFTs. I made bad buys, held for too long, and
ultimately never calculated how much money I lost trying to mint
a rare .jpg from a batch of 10,000.

This was an expensive lesson in first-mover advantage and
arbitrage. Not only was it financially expensive, but it was
all-consuming in terms of my time and attention, too.

--------------------
Lessons in arbitrage
--------------------

Arbitrage means YOU know something before most of the world
(market) does. As a reward, you can use that information to make
money with little effort. Arbitrage opportunities are real
opportunities, and they can be lucrative.

Here's an example: If you can buy Gold for $100 and then sell it
for $120, you've effectively created a machine to print $20.
Early Amazon sellers were identifying arbitrage opportunities for
products they bought wholesale on Alibaba, branded, and sold in
the U.S. Minting NFTs was an arbitrage opportunity. I used to buy
presale concert tickets to resell them on Stubhub—that's all
arbitrage.

The problem with arbitrage is that it's a fleeting window that
eventually closes when the market catches up or when too many
people enter the game. And when they close, someone is often left
holding the bag. In my ticket reselling days, I once bought
dozens of tickets to a Jay-Z and Beyoncé concert series. They
were GREAT seats, and I thought I'd make a killing.
Unfortunately, the series wasn't nearly as popular as I expected,
and I couldn't even resell them at the price I paid.

Here's what I've learned about being a first-mover: You have to
be fast, intense, and maybe even a little cutthroat. If not,
someone else who IS will beat you.

-----------
AI-rbitrage
-----------

If you're feeling a pull that you should be "doing more with AI,"
you're not alone. I see the same hunger in every creator group
I'm in.

There's no doubt—AI is changing the way we're doing things. The
way we learn, the way we make, even the way we communicate. But I
can't help but notice that the AI environment feels like the NFT
environment did. There are very real opportunities. People are
definitely capitalizing and making money doing so.

I see creators use this in a bunch of different ways:

* Using prompts to generate a ton of content output. They can
schedule this in bulk; they're publishing a ton every day and
spending little time on content creation.
* Literally creating AI audio and video clones so that they're no
longer recording! Their digital double performs for them.
* Shifting their entire strategy to talk about AI
* Creating software tools using coding software like Claude Code.
It's never been easier to build a SaaS.

I'm smart and paying close attention—I feel the pull to try these
things. But, ultimately, I can't shake the feeling that many of
these are arbitrage opportunities. When the volume of content in
feeds increases, it's harder to break through. So what do you do?
Improve your prompts? Try to produce even more so you win through
big numbers? Or revert back to a more handcrafted, human,
less-is-more approach?

Does that make me enjoy the work more? Does it make me more
useful?

Software feels particularly tempting. In Nathan Barry's classic
essay, "The Ladders of Wealth Creation (
https://400c164b.click.convertkit-mail2.com/mvu2mp338ec5hq2rdqqhmhr22m2qqf3hwd9zq/owhkhqhwxddl8wbv/aHR0cHM6Ly9uYXRoYW5iYXJyeS5jb20vd2VhbHRoLWNyZWF0aW9uLw==
)," he places software near the top of the ladder.

But...the easier software becomes...the more competition will
enter the market. If you build a successful piece of software at
[$49/mo], someone else can easily clone it and charge [$39/mo].
To win, you need to continually make the software increasingly
valuable and difficult to switch from. That means quickly moving
from vibe-coder to software CEO.

Otherwise, it's a race to the bottom.

------------------------------------------
Should you ignore these new opportunities?
------------------------------------------

I don't want to talk you out of anything you're excited about.
But I do want to talk you out of acting from a place of FOMO.

You don't win arbitrage games with FOMO. You win arbitrage games
with obsession and intensity. If you have an obsession or
intensity toward something, follow it! That's an incredible
compass. In fact, that level of conviction is the juice you need
to succeed over the long-term.

But the worst thing you can do is let FOMO pull you away from
something you have a genuine interest in.

Here's what I know about you: You didn't start creating to be
told what you should be doing. You started because you had
something to say. That voice—your actual voice—is still your best
competitive advantage. The shortcuts will come and go, but the
trust and relationships you build can be enduring.

As long as you're showing up and helping your audience move
closer to their goals, you're on the right track. If you can
leverage new capabilities to help them get there faster and more
easily, amazing.

But you don't need to play arbitrage games just because you see
them.

Bookkeeping probably isn’t at the top of your list of priorities.
But it’s something that I’ve been taking seriously for years now,
and up-to-date financial reports play a huge part in my
month-to-month plans and projections. It’s also non-negotiable
come tax season, when clean, up-to-date books stop being “nice to
have” and start being essential.

This was a painful, time-consuming, manual process before Kick (

Kick uses cutting-edge AI to provide self-driving bookkeeping
that does the work for you, with expert accountant reviews. It
automatically learns and recommends rules that categorize your
transactions in a fraction of the time. It is beautifully
designed and easier to use than QuickBooks.

The founder of Kick also co-founded Teachable. They're backed by
OpenAI and 60+ investors with backgrounds at companies like
Stripe, Notion, and Square. It's built for creators and, on
average, saves users $4,000 on their taxes.

Kick works out of the box and only takes five minutes to set up.
Kick is free to start, so there's no reason not to give it a try.
I believe in it so much that I'm a customer AND an investor.

I was given a special offer to share with you. When you sign up
for their Custom pricing plan (the most white-glove version of
their service), they'll personally catch up your 2025 bookkeeping
at no additional cost. That's a $2,000 value.

Not only that, they're offering Creator Science readers 25% off
any Kick plan (including Custom) for 2026.

NEW EPISODE 🎧

#291: 48 Hours With Clawdbot: How I’m Using It and Initial
Reactions

Last weekend, I completely fell down the rabbit hole with a new
AI tool called Clawdbot (rebranded TODAY to Moltbot). Instead of
my planned episode about what's on my mind in January 2026, I
decided to share my raw, unfiltered experience setting up this AI
assistant that runs 24/7 and integrates with all my tools. This
isn't your typical AI chat interface—it's an always-on assistant
I can text through Telegram that proactively handles research,
automates workflows, and maintains institutional memory of all my
content.

I'll walk you through exactly how I discovered it, my
security-first setup approach using a virtual private server, the
learning curve (spoiler: it took me until 1:30 AM), and the
specific ways I'm using it now. From automated guest research and
fitness tracking to content ideation from my 300+ podcast
transcripts, this tool is changing how I think about AI
assistance. But I'm also wrestling with bigger questions about
what this means for content creation, human creativity, and where
we draw the line on AI-generated work.
