Hey Will,

The content landscape feels different.

As an individual, the capabilities of AI are more and more
exciting. Claude Code has been hot for months, and Claude Cowork
will soon be the topic de jour as people realize the non-coding
tasks this thing can just...do.

I'm using Projects in Claude to help me think through different
challenges. Each Project has unique instructions and source files
to tailor that feedback, including:

* Fitness coaching
* Career coaching
* Content coaching
* Research on particular topics

And while I'm certainly not a power user compared to the accounts
dominating my "For You" feed on X, I can see that my way of
learning has forever changed. AI still makes mistakes, and its
responses need to be validated. But it's certainly easier to get
the information you need from a personalized query than to search
for the "best fit" YouTube video and then extrapolate that
information to your situation.

As an educational creator, this feels a little scary.

"How to" instructional content is still useful, but it's far less
valuable. It's likely to be more effortful to take general "how
to" content and then apply it to my situation than to prompt an
LLM about my situation and ask for personalized "how to" content
that can be generated in moments.

On YouTube, I still get pulled in by videos that create a
curiosity gap. But instead of watching the video, I find myself
summarizing with Gemini to close that gap (which often satisfies
me, and I leave the video).

I'm starting to see the value of training a model on your
existing content library. Perhaps as a stand-alone product, but
certainly an added benefit to a coaching, consulting, or
membership product.

So, is content dead?

Well, no. My screen time hasn't meaningfully declined, and yours
probably hasn't either. If left unchecked, I still lose hours to
short-form video. I'm reading more books and long-form writing
than ever before. I still listen to podcasts.

So the prompt I've been trying to keep top of mind is: What type
of content am I seeking out and placing a premium on?

For me, it's been:

* Long-form writing. People connecting the dots between multiple
disciplines in new ways that explain the world, our relation to
it, and our relation to each other. Lots of books and Substack
here.
* Effortful art. The type of stuff that combines skill with a ton
of effort and patience—where you think, "They spent all that time
to do that?" This is my favorite part of my Instagram feed.
* Demonstrations. AI can give me a "how to," but I still watch
people actually demonstrate their personal approach to things.
This is a lot of my YouTube consumption—solo and interview videos
with screensharing. Though I find most of these demonstrations
I'm watching are related to AI specifically, so this may not
persist.
* Interviews with people who have unique, verifiable experiences.
When I scroll my podcast feed, I'll still listen to interviews
from interviewers I trust and guests who have lived interesting
lives. Not because I think I'll get anything in particular from
that episode, but because I trust that the combination of skilled
interviewer + unique background will bring some new insight or
perspective for my worldview.
* Good hangs. People who make me feel comfortable, at ease, and
confident.

Trust in the creator plays a bigger role than ever before. The
more thoughtful I am about where I direct my attention, the more
I'm asking myself whether I trust this creator to be a good
steward of it.

The landscape is changing so quickly. As a creator, I feel less
confident or qualified to teach anything right
now—experimentation has never been more important.

In our community Town Hall this week, I encouraged our members to
simply share more of their experiments—no matter how big or
small. The pace of change is simply too fast, and the best way
creators like us can support one another is by sharing our
experiments (successes and failures) as quickly as possible. As
we all face the headwinds of AI in education, we can support one
another by finding new ways to create value.

As for my work, I'll be embodying the role of "teacher" less in
this season. Right now, I feel like I'm back to being a student
of the current landscape. A friend on a parallel journey. I'll
pass along what I'm learning, and hope to have some
breakthroughs! As you do the same, my inbox is always open to
learning from you.

How are you feeling in this season? What challenges are you
experiencing?
Hit reply—I'd love to hear from you.

PS: We're starting new masterminds in The Lab soon. If you want
to experiment and learn alongside a curated small group and our
entire community, it's a great time to join (

Special Offer: Free 2025 Bookkeeping + 25% off any plan in 2026

Bookkeeping probably isn’t at the top of your list of priorities.
But it’s something that I’ve been taking seriously for years now,
and up-to-date financial reports play a huge part in my
month-to-month plans and projections. It’s also non-negotiable
come tax season, when clean, up-to-date books stop being “nice to
have” and start being essential.

This was a painful, time-consuming, manual process before Kick (
https://400c164b.click.convertkit-mail2.com/8ku2gwvvepcoh2wv74lakhk6pm399h3hmxk65/n2hohvhv2rwgv4f6/aHR0cHM6Ly9jcmVhdG9yc2NpZW5jZS5jby9raWNrLTEtMjUtMjY=
).

Kick uses cutting-edge AI to provide self-driving bookkeeping
that does the work for you, with expert accountant reviews. It
automatically learns and recommends rules that categorize your
transactions in a fraction of the time. It is beautifully
designed and easier to use than QuickBooks.

The founder of Kick also co-founded Teachable. They're backed by
OpenAI and 60+ investors with backgrounds at companies like
Stripe, Notion, and Square. It's built for creators and, on
average, saves users $4,000 on their taxes.

Kick works out of the box and only takes five minutes to set up.
Kick is free to start, so there's no reason not to give it a try.
I believe in it so much that I'm a customer AND an investor.

I was given a special offer to share with you. When you sign up
for their Custom pricing plan (the most white-glove version of
their service), they'll personally catch up your 2025 bookkeeping
at no additional cost. That's a $2,000 value.

Not only that, they're offering Creator Science readers 25% off
any Kick plan (including Custom) for 2026.

This isn't on their website, so you'll need to use the button
below to claim this offer. As a Kick affiliate, this gives YOU
their best price, and it also supports us.

NEW EPISODE 🎧

#290: Behind The Scenes: My End of Year Retro

Every month inside The Lab, I do what I call a monthly retro
(short for retrospective). The idea is that, on a regular basis,
you look back at what you have just done to learn from it,
course-correct, and move forward.

So in my monthly retros, I look at the good things that happened,
how I performed against my goals, the concerns I currently have,
the changes I'm going to make moving forward, and my goals for
next month.

This episode is my December 2025 retro, originally shared in The
Lab, and now available for anyone to listen. It was recorded
after I wrote my 2025 Year In Review (
https://400c164b.click.convertkit-mail2.com/8ku2gwvvepcoh2wv74lakhk6pm399h3hmxk65/wnh2hghqmg94x9u7/aHR0cHM6Ly9jcmVhdG9yc2NpZW5jZS5jb20veWVhci1pbi1yZXZpZXctMjAyNS8=
), so it contains a lot of perspective on the year as a whole.
