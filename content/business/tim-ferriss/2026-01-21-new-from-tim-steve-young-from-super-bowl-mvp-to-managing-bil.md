)This episode is part of a series called Meditation Monday. The
teacher, Henry Shukman, has been on my podcast twice before. He
is one of only a few dozen masters in the world authorized to
teach Sanbo Zen, and now, he’ll be your teacher.

In addition to my long-form interviews each week, every Monday
I’ll bring you a short 10-minute or so meditation, which will
help you for the rest of the week.

Over this four-episode series, you’ll develop a Zen toolkit to
help you find greater calm, peace, and effectiveness in your
daily life.

Henry’s app, The Way (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/zluv2o6gkbnhk5nzg3ueawokq500b6h687/z2hghnhe5o2m52ip/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGV3YXlhcHAuY29tL3RpbQ==
), has changed my life since I first started using it. Unlike
other meditation apps, where you’re overwhelmed with a thousand
choices, The Way is a clear step-by-step training program guided
entirely by Henry. Through a logical progression, you’ll develop
real skills that stick with you.

I’ve been using it daily, often twice a day, and it’s lowered my
anxiety more than I thought possible.

As a listener of my podcast, you can get 30 free sessions by
visiting TheWayApp.com/Tim (
