Hi All!

 
Here is your weekly dose of 5-Bullet Friday, a list of what I’m
pondering and exploring.

 
This edition is brought to you by The Way (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/08hwh9h2n240oeul/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhld2F5YXBwLmNvbS90aW0=
), the meditation app I use most often. Be sure to see their
offer in the P.S.

What I’m reading and sharing

“What is the question? (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/8ghqhohowo8e0nuk/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rLnNwcmluZ2VyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwLjExODYvczEzMDU5LTAxOS0xOTAyLTE=
)” by Itai Yanai (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/vqh3hrhomo62x7ig/aHR0cHM6Ly94LmNvbS9JdGFpWWFuYWk=
) and Martin Lercher (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/l2hehmhlqlp50mh6/aHR0cHM6Ly94LmNvbS9NYXJ0aW5KTGVyY2hlcg==
). This is an outstanding read. Even if you have little interest
in how the best scientists work, this will help you become a
better and more productive thinker.

Take it from W. Edwards Deming (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/m2h7h5h323xkgdam/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvVy5fRWR3YXJkc19EZW1pbmc=
), who is best known as the “father of the quality movement” for
revolutionizing post-WWII Japan and making it one of the most
dominant economies in the world: “If you do not know how to ask
the right question, you discover nothing.”

What I’m rewatching
-------------------

Burden of Dreams (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/dpheh0hedexz4pcm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC92aWRlby9kZXRhaWwvQjAwQTVJWEVGMC8_dGFnPW9mZnNpdG9mdGltZmUtMjA=
) (Amazon (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/dpheh0hedexz4pcm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC92aWRlby9kZXRhaWwvQjAwQTVJWEVGMC8_dGFnPW9mZnNpdG9mdGltZmUtMjA=
), Apple TV (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/e0hph7h7m7z9pdf8/aHR0cHM6Ly9pdHVuZXMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL21vdmllL2lkNDc0NjE4ODIz
)). This documentary was recommended to me by one of the most
phenomenal artists I know, Dustin Yellin (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/7qh7h8h9d9evkeaz/aHR0cHM6Ly90aW0uYmxvZy8yMDIwLzA5LzI0L2R1c3Rpbi15ZWxsaW4vP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj01YmYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1jb252ZXJ0a2l0JnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Y29udmVydGtpdA==
). Burden of Dreams is a strange and captivating film. It’s a
showcase of tackling the impossible, being unrealistic, and
failing above others’ successes. On so many levels, the
compulsion, single-mindedness, and all-or-nothing drive of
legendary filmmaker Werner Herzog (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/owhkhqhwxwe3kzhv/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2VybmVyaGVyem9nLmNvbS8=
) makes no sense. And yet… to me, parts of his journey, and parts
of his worldview, make all the sense in the world. This is a
bizarre one that will only appeal to a small fraction of you, but
here’s the official film description, edited for length: “For
nearly five years, Werner Herzog worked on one of the most
ambitious and difficult films of his career, Fitzcarraldo (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/z2hghnhe5ez9k9hp/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucm90dGVudG9tYXRvZXMuY29tL20vZml0emNhcnJhbGRv
), the story of one man’s attempt to build an opera house deep in
the Amazon jungle. Documentary filmmaker Les Blank (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/p8heh9h4r4ek23aq/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvTGVzX0JsYW5r
) captured the unfolding of this production, including a sequence
requiring [the pulling of] a full-size, 320-ton steamship over a
small mountain.”

Article I’m reading
-------------------

“The Plastic Inside Us (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/x0hph6hekem8ppi5/aHR0cHM6Ly9tYWdhemluZS51Y3NmLmVkdS9wbGFzdGljLWluc2lkZS11cw==
)” by Wynne Parry (

) for UCSF Magazine. From the article: “Every day, in a thousand
ways, we take advantage of the utility of plastic. It’s in our
clothes, our cars, our cosmetics, and so much more. But
eventually, these products turn into something else: tiny
synthetic particles that spread quite literally everywhere—into
our air, our food, our water, even inside of us. We are only
beginning to tease out what the presence of these microplastics
means for our health—and what we can do about it.” I hope to have
more thoughts later this year about how to deal with PFAS
“forever chemicals.”

“A writer’s heart, a poet’s heart, an artist’s heart, a
musician’s heart is always breaking. It is through that broken

P.S. Deal of the Week — The Way meditation training program (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/58hvh7hg3gwpnlf6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhld2F5YXBwLmNvbS9UaW0=
). 10 minutes a day might just change your life…
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve explored a lot of meditation practices over the years. My
current hands-down favorite, and the easiest way to get back in
the habit, is The Way (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/58hvh7hg3gwpnlf6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhld2F5YXBwLmNvbS9UaW0=
), taught by Zen Master Henry Shukman. Using the app for just
10–20 minutes a day has reduced my anxiety more than I would have
thought possible with any app. Try it for a week, and I think
you’ll notice something similar. Here are 30 sessions for free (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/58hvh7hg3gwpnlf6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhld2F5YXBwLmNvbS9UaW0=
). 

The Way (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/58hvh7hg3gwpnlf6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhld2F5YXBwLmNvbS9UaW0=
) leads you down a single, long-term path that covers all the
key areas of a deep and fulfilling meditation practice. It’s an
easy and calming way to find more ease and calm. There’s no
overwhelming menu of stuff or meditation du jour, just Henry
taking you on a logical progression of lessons, one manageable
bite at a time. You’ll be learning skills you can actually take
into your daily life. Henry’s sessions will become something you
look forward to. He’s appeared on my podcast twice and is always
a listener favorite. I recently chose to invest in The Way, given
all the above, and I’ve been working with Henry and his team to
make the app as good as humanly possible. I’ve probably sent a
hundred notes on the product, and they’ve been improving it each
and every week.

Now, subscribers to 5-Bullet Friday can try 30 sessions for free
(

), no credit card required. Just go to TheWayApp.com/Tim (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/75urozl7nu8h6d7vdpu0tweg7o66bnhz7r/25h2hoh3l3xr8la3/aHR0cDovL3RoZXdheWFwcC5jb20vVGlt
). Try it for a week, and I think you’ll be more than pleasantly
surprised.
