Hi All!

 
Here is your weekly dose of 5-Bullet Friday, a list of what I’m
pondering and exploring. I threw in an extra bullet for added
spice.

 

---------------------
What I’m listening to
---------------------

“Granada (

), Spotify (

), Apple Music (

)) by Lebanese composer, oud (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/8ku7lprq8toh2w8rl7iqak6pm399h3hp9k/58hvh7hg3x3xgpc6/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvT3Vk
) master, and singer Marcel Khalife (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/8ku7lprq8toh2w8rl7iqak6pm399h3hp9k/25h2hoh3l9l93vu3/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS9raGFsaWZlbWFyY2VsLw==
). This is two songs in one. The first half is totally unlike the
second half. It’s a long ’un and worth the time.

My #1 writing priority this week
--------------------------------

“How I Beat Lyme Disease with The Ketogenic Diet (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/8ku7lprq8toh2w8rl7iqak6pm399h3hp9k/qvh8h7hdewewd4bl/aHR0cHM6Ly90aW0uYmxvZy8yMDI2LzAxLzMwL2x5bWUtZGlzZWFzZS1rZXRvZ2VuaWMtZGlldC8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPTViZiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWNvbnZlcnRraXQmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1jb252ZXJ0a2l0
).” I started writing this as a reply on X to Greg Yang (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/8ku7lprq8toh2w8rl7iqak6pm399h3hp9k/g3hnh5hmg9g9mnhr/aHR0cHM6Ly94LmNvbS9UaGVHcmVnWWFuZy9zdGF0dXMvMjAxMzY1MjYwOTQ1NTAwNjAwNg==
), co-founder of xAI (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/8ku7lprq8toh2w8rl7iqak6pm399h3hp9k/9qhzhnhd4w4wd3u9/aHR0cHM6Ly94LmFpLw==
), who recently stepped down from xAI to address his debilitating
case of Lyme disease (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/8ku7lprq8toh2w8rl7iqak6pm399h3hp9k/g3hnh5hmg9g9mnhr/aHR0cHM6Ly94LmNvbS9UaGVHcmVnWWFuZy9zdGF0dXMvMjAxMzY1MjYwOTQ1NTAwNjAwNg==
). Ultimately, I decided that a blog post (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/8ku7lprq8toh2w8rl7iqak6pm399h3hp9k/qvh8h7hdewewd4bl/aHR0cHM6Ly90aW0uYmxvZy8yMDI2LzAxLzMwL2x5bWUtZGlzZWFzZS1rZXRvZ2VuaWMtZGlldC8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPTViZiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWNvbnZlcnRraXQmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1jb252ZXJ0a2l0
) could provide more detail and allow proofreading by credible
scientists, so here we are. The post covers the science, exact
how-to protocols, and much more.

 

-------------------------
What I’m excited to share
-------------------------

My appearance on The Shawn Ryan Show (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/8ku7lprq8toh2w8rl7iqak6pm399h3hp9k/3ohphkh3xmxm3ncr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj0zVlQtRkt2Zm5xbw==
). Shawn is a former U.S. Navy SEAL and CIA contractor who served
for 14 years across multiple combat missions. He led us to some
edgy and strange topics that I don’t usually discuss publicly. I
had a lot of fun.

His show is one of the fastest-growing and most popular podcasts
in the world, and I was very impressed with the entire operation
he’s built. Kudos to Shawn and his entire team.

 

-------------------------------
Science I’m paying attention to
-------------------------------

“Alzheimer’s blood tests may be misleading for people with kidney
problems (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/8ku7lprq8toh2w8rl7iqak6pm399h3hp9k/n2hohvhv2q2qvoc6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2NpZW5jZWRhaWx5LmNvbS9yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDI1LzEyLzI1MTIwNTA0NTg0NS5odG0=
).” Summary: “A large study found that people with impaired
kidneys tend to have higher Alzheimer’s biomarkers, yet they
don’t face a higher overall risk of dementia. For those who
already have elevated biomarkers, kidney problems may speed up
when symptoms appear. The findings show that kidney health can
change how Alzheimer’s blood tests are read. Doctors may need to
consider both organs to get a clearer picture.” Pair this article
with my brand-new conversation with Dr. Tommy Wood (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/8ku7lprq8toh2w8rl7iqak6pm399h3hp9k/48hvhehmwlwlm0tx/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj10VExMZlVvT0ZMVQ==
) on preventing dementia.

Podcast guest I’m remembering
-----------------------------

“In Memoriam: Art De Vany (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/8ku7lprq8toh2w8rl7iqak6pm399h3hp9k/wnh2hghqm7m7qwi7/aHR0cHM6Ly9yb2Jid29sZi5zdWJzdGFjay5jb20vcC9pbi1tZW1vcmlhbS1hcnQtZGUtdmFueT9yPTdjb2omc2hhcmVJbWFnZVZhcmlhbnQ9b3ZlcmxheSZ0cmllZFJlZGlyZWN0PXRydWUmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1pb3M=

Quote I’m pondering
-------------------

“Our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we
call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all
about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie
potential forms of consciousness entirely different. We may go
through life without suspecting their existence; but apply the
requisite stimulus and at a touch they are there in all their
completeness. … No account of the universe in its totality can be
final which leaves these other forms of consciousness quite
disregarded.”
— William James (

)

You can complement this edition of 5-Bullet Friday with my recent
conversation (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/8ku7lprq8toh2w8rl7iqak6pm399h3hp9k/8ghqhohowdwdo9ck/aHR0cHM6Ly90aW0uYmxvZy8yMDI2LzAxLzA2L2tldG9zaXMtcHJhY3RpY2FsLWd1aWRlLWRvbS1kYWdvc3Rpbm8vP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj01YmYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1jb252ZXJ0a2l0JnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Y29udmVydGtpdA==
) with Dr. Dominic D’Agostino on how to use ketosis for enhanced
mood, cognition, and long-term brain protection, plus my latest
keto experiment.

And, as always, please give me feedback on X. Which bullet above
is your favorite? What do you want more or less of? Other
suggestions? Please let me know. Just send a tweet to @tferriss (
https://click.fourhourmail.com/8ku7lprq8toh2w8rl7iqak6pm399h3hp9k/vqh3hrhom0m0o8sg/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS90ZmVycmlzcw==
) and put #5BulletFriday at the end so I can find it.

Have a wonderful weekend, all.

Much love to you and yours,

Tim
