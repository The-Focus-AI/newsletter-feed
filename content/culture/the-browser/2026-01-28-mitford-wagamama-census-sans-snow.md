One Of The Worst Things [https://thebrowser.com/r/0e22c747?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Rosemary Hill | London Review Of Books | 28th January 2026 | B

Review of the first scholarly biography of Jessica Mitford, also known as "Decca". She was a communist who sat awkwardly in a group of sisters that included two Nazis, a Bright Young Thing and the châtelaine of a notable stately home. What she termed the "Mitford Industry" was a perpetual source of frustration to Jessica, yet without it her impact on American civil rights would have been minimal (4,600 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/19911661?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Whining And Dining [https://thebrowser.com/r/bdcee6ae?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Private equity has "a remarkable taste for British food". In some places, it's hard to buy a meal that wasn't financed this way. It worked out well for the 1996 investors in Wagamama. But the path to profitability is now strewn with rocky economic forecasts. Overheads are surging. Times are hard. Restaurants have to decide whether they want to be "plundered for profit — or patronised for pleasure" (3,000 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/b05fbf83?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

A Lot Of Population Numbers Are Fake [https://thebrowser.com/r/461b446d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

David Oks | 21st January 2026 | U

Good population data is hard to come by. As such: "We simply have no idea how many people live in many of the world’s countries." Conducting a good census is expensive, difficult and, often, politically fraught. Corrupt officials can inflate the numbers for gain. Satellites are useful to an extent, but they can't look inside dwellings to see who lives there. We know less about the world that we think (3,700 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/be752034?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Graphic designer describes the process of creating a new font inspired by the displays on a specific San Francisco train route. Owing to the proliferation of transit agencies, the city is "an eclectic patchwork of typography". This sign has "a raw, analogue quality" thanks to its fixed grid and fluorescent backlighting. The eventual font was created by stacking elements "like Lego" to build letters (1,700 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/efde5ede?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Ask Not, 'Will it Snow?' [https://thebrowser.com/r/586ccef5?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Zeynep Tufekci | The Message | 27th January 2015 | U

Instead, you should ask for the distribution of the forecast: how probable is a major blizzard? You also need to weigh the damage done by a false positives (you warn of a blizzard and it doesn't come) against the damage done by a false negative (you don't warn of a blizzard, and it does come). It's usually the right choice to prepare for a blizzard that doesn't happen, annoying as that may seem (2,000 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/a4ec6da0?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])
