Evolution Unleashed [https://thebrowser.com/r/cc7bee6e?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Kevin Laland | Aeon | 17th January 2018

Evolution is more complicated than Darwin imagined. Darwinism teaches that the inheritance of acquired characteristics is impossible; a mouse cannot be born with a trait that its parents acquired during their lifetimes. And yet, experiments show that such things do happen. Genomes adapt over hundreds to thousands of generations; epigenetic modifications and inherited cultural factors operate over tens or hundreds of generations; parental effects operate over single generations (3,400 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/61847e8f?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Breaking The Zimmerman Telegram [https://thebrowser.com/r/f27b33b3?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

John Bull | Lapsed Historian | 18th January 2018

When World War One broke out, and Britain cut Germany’s transatlantic telegraph cable, Germany shifted its diplomatic traffic to the neutral American cable — apparently unaware that the American cable crossed British soil. The British tapped the cable, and in 1917 decrypted a German telegram urging Mexico to make war on the United States. This was enough to bring America into the war. But how could the British reveal the telegram, without revealing that they tapped the American cable? (4,700 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/2212d0a5?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Last week’s question

We recommended Jillian Hess’ The Paradox of Failed Resolutions [https://thebrowser.com/r/dabda53c?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd], in which she defends the utility of our failed resolutions.

> What resolutions have Browser readers made this year? We’d love to hear — anonymously, if you prefer!

A short but sweet selection of resolutions [https://thebrowser.com/r/a5aa214e?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd] were sent in — some Browser-related, to our delight. Films, cooking, reading, asking questions: it's a mailbag of quiet joys.

Book Of The Week

The World in Flames: A Global History of the Seven Years’ War| Marian Füssel [https://thebrowser.com/r/ab3d0faf?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Recommended by Adam Storring at Five Books: [https://thebrowser.com/r/7796fa2d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

“This book is a very important example of new ways that people are looking at the history of war... Marian Füssel’s book helps us to understand things like the perspectives of ordinary soldiers, how the violence of these wars was experienced by those caught up in them, and how people thought about who had won a battle in cases where it was indecisive.”

Poem Of The Week

Walk ’Bout | Kwame Dawes [https://thebrowser.com/r/aa37df93?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]
Ode to Kingston as sanctified in words by “the prophets and the seers”. Dense with insights into meaning-making.

> The wheezing boy...
> stands there considering the sky, considering the taste
> of green mangoes, considering the chaos of memory
> as if there may be a holy writ to be retained. Perhaps
> this terror of forgetting is the making of the prophet,
> the scribe who longs to name each street, each scent
> arriving and departing, this is where fear is fostered,
> and perhaps art is made.
