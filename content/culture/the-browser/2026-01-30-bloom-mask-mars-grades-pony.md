The Influence Of Anxiety [https://thebrowser.com/r/e116ca7c?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Sam Jennings | Point | 30th January 2026 | B

Academia has never really forgiven Harold Bloom, one of their own who became arguably the most famous literary critic in the world. With greater distance, his identification of anxiety as an engine of creative expression seems inspired. "Only by going through anxiety, only by naming it, learning from it, and letting it pass into and out of us, can we survive the crushing pressure of our own traditions" (4,300 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/08556a14?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Best Gas Masks [https://thebrowser.com/r/d5695d83?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Sarah Jeong | Verge | 29th January 2026 | U

Part product guide, part explainer. The feeling of being tear gassed while reporting on a protest is "excruciating, like your lungs are trying to kill you from the inside out", but after it has happened a few times "you mostly just resent the inconvenience". A good gas mask covers the whole face, is very durable, and is comfortable enough to wear for long periods without chafing at the face or hair (2,200 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/a29ab1c0?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Baby-Making On Mars [https://thebrowser.com/r/bb7231a6?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Darshana Narayanan | Broadcast | 15th January 2026 | U

The question of whether mammals, and eventually humans, can successfully reproduce in space is sufficiently pressing that it was the subject of one of the only Soviet-US scientific collaborations of the Cold War. We still don't know if zero gravity pregnancy is possible, let alone a successful delivery. Rockets might get us to Mars, but it is mothers who will allow us to remain there (8,100 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/cccac10b?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Seventh-Grader On Educational Technology [https://thebrowser.com/r/04695229?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Micah Blachman | 18th January 2026 | U

Twelve-year-old casts a critical eye over the tech involved in his education. Instructors can cast presentations onto students' personal computers, track their grades and assignments, set them videos to watch, and annotate material on interactive whiteboards. The verdict? "I don’t necessarily feel like any of them really help me learn." AI is forbidden for students but teachers can and do use it (1,200 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/f3b2eb8d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Friendship Is Complicated [https://thebrowser.com/r/84617de8?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Maria Bustillos | Longreads | 28th January 2015 | U

My Little Pony takes a strange turn. The magic ponies go through a mirror and come out on the other side as fashion-obsessed high-school students with a show of their own called Equestria Girls. Why? Because business. Branded toys make more money than the cartoons on which they are based. Hasbro owns the franchise for My Little Pony. Hasbro wants a high-school show. The ponies must provide (3,700 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/eb3dce10?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Conversational history of a 2013 mobile game, which was "extremely simple and yet punishingly difficult".

An expert takes a closer look at Seurat's 1884 painting Bathers at Asnières, positing that his blank, unreal-seeming figures were an attempt to break with the Renaissance-era training he had received.
