I Live As A Crane [https://thebrowser.com/r/c6c530e3?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Marianne Wellington | Guardian | 16th January 2026 | U

If endangered crane chicks are to be successfully released into the wild, the young must believe their human attendants are birds. Thus, aviculturists don an elaborate costume with a bird's head puppet on one arm and a "wing" on the other, play bird sounds from a concealed mp3 player, and give flying lessons. This ersatz-crane dreams sometimes of taking flight like a real bird (900 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/1987bf57?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Ode To The On-Mountain Meal [https://thebrowser.com/r/9dfc8dbd?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

The best thing about skiing is the food — take it from someone who grew up as a "resort rat" while his father ran the ski school. Whether it is is $100 flammkuchen in St Moritz or the greasiest burger available in a mountainside New Hampshire cafeteria, hot food always tastes wonderful in the cold air. It is not advisable to order a magnum of Riesling with lunch and then ski home, though (2,500 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/3ba3b54e?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Brass Bands [https://thebrowser.com/r/89c85176?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Rachel Armitage | London Review Of Books | 14th January 2026 | B

Notes from the finals of the UK's National Brass Band Championships. Each of the nineteen ensembles played the same piece, written specially to make the competition fair but testing. After a few renditions, the noise is "oppressive and disorienting". All the players are amateurs, competing for pride and a £2,000 prize. Some of the bands have existed for 150 years. The winners had to be fetched from the pub (2,000 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/8a58ebd2?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Kafka Inc. [https://thebrowser.com/r/d3e70171?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Jared Marcel Pollen | Liberties | 23rd December 2025 | U

In life, Franz Kafka resisted easy interpretation. Now, he is central to Prague's tourism industry and an academic discipline unto himself. "His work has been examined, excavated, and interpreted to the point that the ratio of words written by Kafka to words written about Kafka is now estimated to be about 1:10,000,000. A symbolic punishment for a man who himself claimed to be 'made of literature'" (2,800 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/35a48413?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Magnificent rant, one month after the Peshawar massacre. "Pakistan has become a euphemism for insanity. Doing the same thing over and over again and hoping for a different outcome. There are some incredibly brave and patriotic Pakistani men and women who are determined to chart a different future for the country. But there is a huge obstacle in their way. They are outnumbered by the rest of us" (1,000 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/78da4ab7?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Performance of a famous J.S. Bach piece using accurate early music instruments. The Baroque oboe gives a distinct and beautiful sound to the solo melody.
