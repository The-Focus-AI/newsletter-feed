Uncomfortable Truths About Immigration [https://thebrowser.com/r/a9ded22d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Alexander Kustov | Popular By Design | 22nd January 2026 | U

“A lot of what liberal elites on both sides of the Atlantic say about immigration is deliberately misleading in ways that matter for policy and for democratic trust. It is ‘highbrow misinformation’ built out of selective framing, strategic omissions and ‘noble’ half-truths. It likely makes it harder to build durable majorities for freer immigration policies in the long run.” This author catalogues the myths (5,600 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/26dea486?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Seeing Like A Sedan [https://thebrowser.com/r/9bf231f8?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Andrew Miller | Asterisk | 26th January 2026 | U

A Waymo and a Tesla Cybercab, both self-driving cars, see the world very differently. The Waymo uses lidar and radar for a detailed 3D model of its environment beyond what humans can see. A Cybercab has no lidar or radar. It has 8 cameras which send video feeds to a neural network to identify objects and gauge dimensions. “Which technology wins out will determine the future of self-driving vehicles” (6,100 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/f25f920d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

The Influence Of Anxiety [https://thebrowser.com/r/7b22cd22?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Sam Jennings | Point | 30th January 2026 | B

Academia has never really forgiven Harold Bloom, one of their own who became arguably the most famous literary critic in the world. With greater distance, his identification of anxiety as an engine of creative expression seems inspired. "Only by going through anxiety, only by naming it, learning from it, and letting it pass into and out of us, can we survive the crushing pressure of our own traditions" (4,300 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/4588b58a?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

On Political Power [https://thebrowser.com/r/95aa1a8c?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Henrik Karlsson | Escaping Flatland | 28th January 2026 | U

Thoughts after reading the first volume of Robert Caro's Lyndon B. Johnson biography. Political power is not, as the writer had thought, endowed by jobs or institutions. Real political operatives understand that it "is something you frack, something you force out of the stone by pumping fluid into the cracks". Every drop adds up. Johnson saw the world this way, and had done since he was a toddler (2,700 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/4805b448?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Emily Sneddon | 6th November 2025 | U

Graphic designer describes the process of creating a new font inspired by the displays on a specific San Francisco train route. Owing to the proliferation of transit agencies, the city is "an eclectic patchwork of typography". This sign has "a raw, analogue quality" thanks to its fixed grid and fluorescent backlighting. The eventual font was created by stacking elements "like Lego" to build letters (1,700 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/b0970780?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])
