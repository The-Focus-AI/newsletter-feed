Why The Iranian Regime Seems Invincible [https://thebrowser.com/r/e3608208?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Anonymous Iranian | Persuasion | 8th January 2026 | U

The Islamic Republic is a maze of power with two parallel governments. Over the years, it has created a class of people who benefit from the regime and another class who enforce it. “Leaderless protests are brave, but fragile.” Potential leaders are arrested or killed immediately. Much of the world has a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. Iranians distrust foreign intervention, with good reason (1,400 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/b9dcd194?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Journalist compares the Bay Area’s housing crisis with the slums of Mumbai. “I began to understand that homelessness in the United States was at least as much about isolation as it was about material deprivation. Being homeless was perceived as an individual failure. There is, of course, nothing to romanticise about Mumbai’s slums. But despite these hardships, they also have a real sense of community” (5,100 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/87231164?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

35 Theses On The WASPs [https://thebrowser.com/r/dc7e29a0?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Tanner Greer | Scholar’s Stage | 12th January 2026 | U

Revisionist account of the “Eastern Establishment”. Once dominant in many spheres of American life, they lost their preeminence in the 1930s due to the Great Depression and the rise of other wealthy elites like the Texas oil tycoon and the Hollywood mogul. Ivy League admissions policies were a “lagging indicator” of this change. The term WASP is misleading, as some of them were of Jewish German origin (3,700 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/ead4db2d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Very Good Music Facts [https://thebrowser.com/r/f0ea0841?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

If you’re at a party and need something to talk about, this compendium of music trivia should come in handy. Bruno Mars was nicknamed after pro-wrestler Bruno Sammartino because he was a chubby baby. Coldplay sent a formal request via lawyers to Kraftwerk to use the “Computer Love” melody. Weeks later, they received a reply from Kraftwerk’s Ralf Hütter, containing only a handwritten “yes” (1,400 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/995d9da2?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

In which the gentle author — “thirty-three years old, five-ten, one-sixty” — learns Brazilian ju-jitsu in a tough gym. “I scored a smashing single-leg takedown but dropped inside his closed guard and fell victim to his guillotine choke: he looped an arm around my giraffey neck and began to uproot my spine the way you pull a weed out of your garden. It was quick and painful, and I tapped out” (1,800 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/d27e425e?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Praiseworthy effort to “see” the sounds of a piano and create a visual spectacle. After three years of discouraging failures, these DIY-ers hit on the idea of using bioluminescent algae.
