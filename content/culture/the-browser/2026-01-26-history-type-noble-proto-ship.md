Inventing The Renaissance [https://thebrowser.com/r/422ac848?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Ada Palmer & Martin Sustrik | 250bpm | 26th January 2026 | U

“How do you study history when particulars determine outcomes but those outcomes remain unpredictable?” This historian “transforms students into the political actors of Renaissance Italy”. Each student receives a character packet with goals, allies, enemies and resources. The teacher moves some characters in time so that students who know what happened won’t try to engineer the “correct” outcome (3,900 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/ee829739?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Diseases Of The Will [https://thebrowser.com/r/edbf204f?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Maria Popova | Marginalian | 25th January 2026 | U

Neuroscientist Santiago Cajal’s 1897 advice book for young scientists has a typology of intellectual weaknesses. There are the “bibliophiles and polyglots” with “encyclopaedic tendencies”. Then the “megalomaniacs” — “bedeviled by overconfidence” — and “serial ideators”, who never reach the execution stage. Also the instrument addicts with a “fetishistic worship of research instruments” (3,200 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/616e2110?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Uncomfortable Truths About Immigration [https://thebrowser.com/r/a71f234e?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Alexander Kustov | Popular By Design | 22nd January 2026 | U

“A lot of what liberal elites on both sides of the Atlantic say about immigration is deliberately misleading in ways that matter for policy and for democratic trust. It is ‘highbrow misinformation’ built out of selective framing, strategic omissions and ‘noble’ half-truths. It likely makes it harder to build durable majorities for freer immigration policies in the long run.” This author catalogues the myths (5,600 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/7e202fa0?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

There Is No Proto-Dragon [https://thebrowser.com/r/4dcb403e?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Alex Conroy | Typebar | 26th January 2026 | U

Dragons appear in cultures across the world. Which one was the first? This seems impossible to determine. Whereas there is undeniably a proto-vampire — Dracula — dragons seem to be more of a loose collection of ideas, perhaps because the word appeared much later in the 13C. “By the time the very idea of a dragon was invented, there were already hundreds of proto-dragons” (3,000 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/6283411c?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Secrets Of The Shipping Industry [https://thebrowser.com/r/5fbb797a?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Rose George | Longreads | 6th September 2013 | U

A glimpse into the prodigious scale of the container-shipping industry. The Maersk Line’s ships use more oil than the whole of Denmark, Maersk’s home country. Maersk is “the Coca-Cola of freight with none of the fame”. If you laid all Maersk’s containers end to end they would stretch more than halfway round the planet. If they were stacked instead, they would be 1,500 miles high or 7,530 Eiffel Towers (4,200 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/e826c161?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Though intensely coordinated, beehives are always buzzing with power struggles. Queen bees routinely kill off would-be challengers to their thrones. The worker bees may also mutiny and rally around a potential new leader.
