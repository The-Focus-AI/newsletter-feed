Inventing The Methods Section [https://thebrowser.com/r/eac5fd44?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Andrew Hunt | Asimov Press | 12th January 2026 | U

Exhaustive history of how the Methods section in modern research papers came to be. As experimental science formalised in the 19C, scientists went from protecting their trade secrets to writing “detailed procedural descriptions as the primary currency of scientific credibility”. This did not last in the 20C, the result of mounting financial pressures on journals to be more concise and efficient (6,800 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/61506a15?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

The Rare People Who Are Solid [https://thebrowser.com/r/6f83532a?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

“If you are highly congruent, you disown none of your experience. You accept the stubborn approach of death, the arbitrariness of your fortune, your unimportance on the cosmic timescale, your potential importance for the local environment. Although congruence is a source of endless happiness, the path there can be devastating. You may have to finally give up on experiencing a better past” (1,500 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/e350b6a1?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Medieval Pig Trials [https://thebrowser.com/r/a50ae7c9?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Anne Ewbank | Popular Science | 13th January 2026 | U

In Medieval Europe, pigs faced trial — and the gallows — surprisingly often. Medieval pigs were more like wild boars, and would sometimes kill and eat children. The trials were serious proceedings, with the pig treated almost like a human defendant. A pig eating a child was “an unbearable inversion of the natural order”. The trial and public execution were seen as a “surefire way to restore what was broken” (1,500 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/d8b71eec?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

How Should A Book Stack Be? [https://thebrowser.com/r/2dad88e0?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Perhaps a single steel tower of books, five feet tall — a bookshelf essentially “designed to disappear”. Bookshelves have always been real estate for one’s personality. The rise of Pinterest and Instagram turned the bookshelf into a stage where one would artfully display a book as a conversation piece or accessory. But avid readers have long known that “a simple stack of books is pretty chic” (1,000 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/0dffcd82?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Boys And Girls Alike [https://thebrowser.com/r/0d9b13bf?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Brian Earp | Aeon | 13th January 2015 | U

Mutilating a child's genitals does no good, and may do terrible harm. That goes for girls and boys alike. Female genital mutilation is rightly condemned around the world; why do we have such different standards for boys? “In some countries, including in the United States, anyone, with any instrument, and any degree of medical training (including none) can attempt to perform a circumcision” (2,800 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/815642e0?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Unusual history of the race to mechanise sewing, which resulted in one of the early instances of a patent thicket — to make a working sewing machine required combining ideas that had been patented by multiple different people. A flurry of suits and countersuits followed. The sewing machine war was ultimately won by Isaac Singer (37m 30s [https://thebrowser.com/r/09f94d00?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])
