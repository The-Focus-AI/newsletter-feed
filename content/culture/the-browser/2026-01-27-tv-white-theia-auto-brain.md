Television Is 100 Years Old [https://thebrowser.com/r/5550dfbb?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Diamond Geezer | 26th January 2026 | U

In a rented room in Hastings, John Logie Baird built the first TV-signal-transmitting equipment using a hatbox, tea chest, darning needles and bicycle light lenses. It caused a 1000-volt electric shock which burned his hand. Three years later, he gave the first official demonstration of a television from his attic workshop in London. Most present failed to realise the significance of what they had just seen (1,400 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/ea0164eb?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

The Myth Of The Police State [https://thebrowser.com/r/a9c1eaab?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Eve Fairbanks | Dial | 27th January 2026 | U

MAGA’s fascination with Orania, the South African town where no people of colour are allowed to live, is downstream of the false view that white citizens are being persecuted in post-Apartheid South Africa. Most white South Africans feel that they are better off now than under the Apartheid regime, which was in fact “a police state that heavily circumscribed white citizens’ lives” (5,300 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/1d396613?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Theia [https://thebrowser.com/r/7a07c896?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Where did the Moon come from? One hypothesis explains many of Earth’s rhythms. Theia is a planet which orbited in the Earth’s gravitational wake when Earth was still hot and new. The pull of another planet sent Theia on a collision course which spun Earth into circling around the Sun at a tilt of 23 degrees. Molten rock ejected coalesced into the Moon, which slowed Earth’s spin, creating the 24-hour day (3,200 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/b9a0fb44?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Seeing Like A Sedan [https://thebrowser.com/r/d33f5bf5?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

A Waymo and a Tesla Cybercab, both self-driving cars, see the world very differently. The Waymo uses lidar and radar for a detailed 3D model of its environment beyond what humans can see. A Cybercab has no lidar or radar. It has 8 cameras which send video feeds to a neural network to identify objects and gauge dimensions. “Which technology wins out will determine the future of self-driving vehicles” (6,100 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/4d4841e6?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

About Your Craniotomy [https://thebrowser.com/r/fc347f2a?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Mary South | White Review | 27th January 2020 | U

Come for the allure of an FAQ about brain surgery; stay for a well-turned short story. “You will be awake for a short interval during the craniotomy. What you might undergo are moments of aphasia or synesthesia, like Kandinsky hearing his paint box hiss. Reports of out-of-body experiences aren’t uncommon. I’ve heard it feels as though you are watching your own handwriting uncoiling from someone else’s pen” (4,200 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/83041260?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])
