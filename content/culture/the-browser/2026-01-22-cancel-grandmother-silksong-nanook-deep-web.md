How To Cancel Someone [https://thebrowser.com/r/f59586a3?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Aella | Knowingless | 22nd January 2026 | U

Proposal for what might be deemed a process of "ethical cancellation", provided the subject has met stringent criteria and poses a concrete threat. When making a public accusation designed to sway public opinion, be factual and precise. Communicate the damage done, but don't demonise or exaggerate. "You should be a small, cold, precise knife that flicks in and out and is done" (2,000 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/beb9da5c?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

My Day Of Extreme Comfort And Luxury [https://thebrowser.com/r/43af6edb?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Genealogical musings. "I am struck in particular by a photo of Bertha, a woman who was born in Minsk, in 1866. The photo was taken towards the end of her life, and the hardness of it seems written on her body and her face. She endured so much." Dozens of people are alive today because this great-great-grandmother decided to flee instead of remain, and was lucky enough to survive (800 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/892eed7d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Four Months And 40 Hours Later [https://thebrowser.com/r/3ce73f50?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Keza MacDonald | Guardian | 12th January 2026 | U

Account of an attempt to cope with extreme nerve pain by playing a very hard videogame extremely slowly. Hollow Knight: Silksong has "the energy of a horror-tinged European animated TV show you only half-remember from your childhood". Usually, long periods of immersion would be required to defeat it. Playing just 20 minutes at a time teaches valuable lessons about the nature of pain (2,300 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/a77141fd?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Greenlandia [https://thebrowser.com/r/76b5e709?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Ernie Smith | Tedium | 24th March 2025 | U

Survey of Greenland's popular culture, from a "quietly political" 1970s rock album — Sumut by Sumé — that critiqued Danish colonisation to the country's unexpected connection to the film adaptation of JD Vance's Hillbilly Elegy. Greenland was surprisingly early to hip-hop, too. Nanook, a popular indie pop band, choose to sing all of their songs in Greenlandic despite having a global fanbase (3,000 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/fe640d3a?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Deep Web Marketplaces [https://thebrowser.com/r/772cd14a?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Joel Monegro | 21st January 2015 | U

Venture capitalist evaluates "deep web marketplaces", which trade mainly in drugs. They differ from from conventional sales platforms in three main ways: They use Bitcoin for settlement; they hold payments in escrow; they don't seek customer data. "How can you build build network effects while relinquishing control of the data? Do you compete on product and user experience? Is that defensible?"
