The Untameable Victor Osimhen [https://thebrowser.com/r/3d2eac8f?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Solace Chukwu | Africa Is A Country | 14th January 2026 | U

In praise of an impetuous yet brilliant Nigerian footballer. Victor Osimhen is arguably the best striker currently playing, who publicly aired his frustration when Nigeria did not qualify for this year's World Cup. Born "into the miasma of a giant, odious landfill in Olusosun" as the youngest of seven, he worked as a water-seller in the Lagos traffic after his mother died. His "unruliness" is crucial to how he plays (1,200 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/05f9495a?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

'I Swear To Chairman Mao!' [https://thebrowser.com/r/a55f1c43?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Jung Chang | LitHub | 13th January 2026 | U

Wild Swans memoirist recalls her teenage years in Chengdu during the Cultural Revolution. Too soft-hearted to join her school's Red Guards, she was accused of "warm-feelingsism". She watched fellow pupils smash the ancient Confucian temple and beat its gardener to death. Teachers were physically punished at "denunciation rallies". Still, at 14, she never thought of rejecting Mao outright (1,800 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/ef9aca31?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

We're All Just Content For ICE [https://thebrowser.com/r/814869eb?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Ryan Broderick | Garbage Day | 12th January 2026 | U

Raw reportage from Minneapolis during Trump's immigration raids. In addition to the brutality, the writer saw first hand how the propaganda is generated: "Brutal state violence and hysterical right-wing internet content work together in lockstep." Substackers and YouTubers are given a ring-side seat to the offensive. The ICE agents themselves seem to lack training and basic weapons skills (1,800 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/8a4b8766?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

There Be Whales Here! [https://thebrowser.com/r/c390c98b?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

David Friedman | Ironic Sans | 18th November 2025 | U

List of giant models of whales, in descending order of size. The largest is a life-size, 98-foot-long blue whale outside the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo. The Natural History Museum in London has an 83-foot skeleton of a whale named "Hope". Santa Fe has a similarly sized model made out of garbage. And if you yearn to have your own whale, you're in luck: models often sell on eBay (1,800 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/e168bdba?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

S. I. Rosenbaum | Boston Magazine | 8th January 2015 | U

Portrait of the great naturalist E.O. Wilson at home in Brookhaven, his retirement community near Boston. Residents come mostly from the faculties of Harvard, MIT, and Tufts. “It’s like a geriatric university”. Wilson, 85, is about to publish his second book in a year. “It’s the perfect place for an author. I don’t think I’m insulting this place when I refer to Brookhaven as a place where old genius comes to die” (2,400 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/3d783569?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])
