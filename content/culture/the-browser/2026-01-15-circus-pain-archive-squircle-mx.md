The Death Of Mastery [https://thebrowser.com/r/2c53cf86?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Tam Hussein | New Lines | 14th January 2026 | U

Logan Paul, a YouTuber, should not be boxing against Anthony Joshua, former two-time world heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medalist. It's a circus act, not a contest of skill. Such a fight shows that in many spheres we are living through the death of mastery at the hands of entertainment. Paul ended up with a broken jaw, but his fame means he can keep cutting ahead of those with real expertise (2,200 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/beddce0b?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

A (Really) Brief History Of Knowledge [https://thebrowser.com/r/a66acd5b?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Colin McGinn | 15th January 2026 | U

Thought experiment. What was the first type of knowledge to exist on Earth? Most likely a consciousness of pain, since it is vital to survival. Next, pleasure, as a contrasting sensation to the one keeping this primordial organism alive. Then came awareness of motion and the environment: "How to get about without banging into things and making a mess." Knowledge originates in struggle (1,700 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/c1cffc92?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

The Long Now Of The Web [https://thebrowser.com/r/f4002eb8?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Bruce Li | Hackernoon | 13th January 2026 | U

The Internet Archive stores versions of over one trillion webpages and 99 petabytes of unique data in a former Christian Science church in San Francisco. If you stand in the nave "you can hear the sound of the internet breathing". This report explains how the Archive is meeting the challenges — financial, spatial, thermodynamic — of storing an ever-increasing amount of data for centuries at a time (4,700 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/d0ed229d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Desperately Seeking Squircles [https://thebrowser.com/r/1826a3fc?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Daniel Furse | Figma | 3rd April 2018 | U

Engineer embarks on a mathematical odyssey to try and understand the "squircle" shape that Apple uses for its app icons. "This may seem trivial, a cool story, but subconsciously it really makes a big impact: a squircle doesn’t look like a square with surgery performed on it; it registers as an entity in its own right, like the shape of a smooth pebble in a riverbed, a unified and elemental whole" (5,900 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/48a299ad?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Mxing It [https://thebrowser.com/r/d51a6cd4?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Debbie Cameron | Language: A Feminist Guide | 15th January 2016 | U

"Just as ‘Ms’ could have replaced ‘Miss’ and ‘Mrs’, ‘Mx’ could in theory replace the whole menu. I’m betting it won’t, though. More likely it will prompt English-speakers to construct a revised taxonomy with a new slot for people who don’t identify as male or female. We’re used to the idea that titles should mark social distinctions. If we’re going to use the same title for everyone, why bother using titles at all?"
