How The Japanese Do Life [https://thebrowser.com/r/50bfcd48?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Christopher Harding | New Statesman | 21st January 2026 | B

Book review. With greater knowledge, Japanese "conformity" seems quite attractive. "Now that we understand the place a bit better, not least because of the tourist boom, we’ve become aware that there is something more going on: an ethic, bred into children from a young age at home and at school, of taking account of the people around you, being aware of their feelings, and acting accordingly" (1,800 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/32d1f664?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Middle Powers Navigating A Changing World [https://thebrowser.com/r/a6ac3811?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Mark Carney | CBC | 20th January 2026 | U

Carney's speech to the World Economic Forum is well worth reading in full. For "middle powers" like Canada, he argues, the "bargain" offered by an international order dictated by American hegemony "no longer works". "If we're not at the table, we're on the menu." The old order will not come back. One of his country's most valuable assets, he says, is "the capacity to stop pretending" (2,500 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/d03ffd28?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Squelch And Slap, Chug And Slug [https://thebrowser.com/r/746e2aa7?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

David Schurman Wallace | Poetry Foundation | 19th January 2026 | U

No other poet ever wrote as much about eels as Seamus Heaney. He had a lifelong preoccupation with "the slipperiness of the real", for which an elusive, elongated fish is an excellent image. His attempts to anchor poetry to the material world resulted in a "famously thick onomatopoeia" and he preferred to look backwards — to his childhood, to the Vikings — rather than forward (3,100 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/271b72b7?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Google Maps Quietly Allocates Survival [https://thebrowser.com/r/2554e20f?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Lauren Leek | 9th December 2026 | U

Data scientist investigates what Google Maps is doing to the restaurant scene in London. The app is so powerful that it now decides which establishments succeed. "It is organised by visibility that compounds, rent that rises when discovery arrives, and algorithms that allocate attention long before consumers ever show up. What looks like 'choice' is increasingly the downstream effect of ranking systems" (1,900 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/3ee56323?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Too Much Music [https://thebrowser.com/r/744b3c2e?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

James Jackson Toth | NPR | 16th January 2018 | U

Spotify and other online music services allow us to extend the music to which we listen almost without limit or cost or effort. With very little emotional investment demanded, the emotional rewards we derive from new music seem less than they used to be in the days of carefully-chosen LPs and CDs. “I know far more today about albums I hated in 1990 than I do about my favourite albums released last year” (4,100 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/b60edbe3?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Experts explore the later years of Jane Austen's life, using her letters and her novels — especially Persuasion — as their source material (35m 16s [https://thebrowser.com/r/3fed5049?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

A skateboarder, a spider, a motorcyclist, a person on a tilting chair — all share a sense of balance that must be maintained in every moment, as demonstrated in this visual meditation on the concept.
