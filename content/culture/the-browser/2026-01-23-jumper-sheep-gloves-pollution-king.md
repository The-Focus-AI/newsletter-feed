Do Today’s Work Today [https://thebrowser.com/r/1e41a8c8?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

What links a 1980s British playground rhyme — "Oompa-Loompa stick it up your jumper" — and the Nazi slogan "Arbeit Macht Frei"? A 1935 comic song about defying authority, which began "Twas Christmas Day at the workhouse and you know how kind they are..." and the headline of this piece, which is emblazoned on a surviving London workhouse, where "city paupers were farmed" as poverty relief (900 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/bb78f6c6?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Best Parts Of Period Dramas Are The Sheep [https://thebrowser.com/r/c0252c6a?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Good screen adaptations of classic British literature contain a lot of sheep. They're a way for a director to show "the economic realities of life in the 19th-century British countryside" without having to include a treatise on enclosure. Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility from 1995 has livestock in almost all of its establishing shots. Stories by the Brontës and Hardy get the same treatment. Also: "Sheep are cute" (1,100 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/8a9c384f?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Caroline Hampton's Rubber Gloves [https://thebrowser.com/r/943c8126?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Kaushik Patowary | Amusing Planet | 22nd January 2026 | U

Wearing rubber gloves during surgery was popularised in part thanks to one 19C nurse's sensitive skin. Caroline Hampton, a "Southern belle" who defied her family background to become the chief operating theatre nurse at Johns Hopkins Hospital, could not tolerate the chemical scrubbing the hygiene-obsessed surgeon William Stewart Halsted required. So, he had Goodyear make her some gloves (1,300 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/bea7a688?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Injury To Buildings And Vegetables [https://thebrowser.com/r/117c82ba?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

On climate change as a class problem, building on the work of Marx, Engels and left-wing ecologist Barry Commoner. "Like the free lunch, the free gift of nature is an illusion. Its costs always appear elsewhere in the system. The question is not whether they are paid, but what form they take and who — or what — pays them." Pollution should be considered and priced as a product of capitalism (4,000 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/b22a3e2e?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Obituary: King Abdullah Of Saudi Arabia [https://thebrowser.com/r/0ebb2ac1?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Madawi Al-Rasheed | Guardian | 22nd January 2015 | U

He came late to the throne and achieved nothing. He used his wealth to undermine the Arab Spring, particularly in Egypt, and so "helped to reverse the prospect of democracy in the Arab world". Under his rule Saudi Arabia "degenerated into multiple fiefdoms". Like his father he married the daughters and widows of defeated enemies: "He is believed to have had around 30 wives, 15 sons and 20 daughters" (2,500 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/2350a4d4?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])
