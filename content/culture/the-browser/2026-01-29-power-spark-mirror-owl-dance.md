On Political Power [https://thebrowser.com/r/81988088?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Henrik Karlsson | Escaping Flatland | 28th January 2026 | U

Thoughts after reading the first volume of Robert Caro's Lyndon B. Johnson biography. Political power is not, as the writer had thought, endowed by jobs or institutions. Real political operatives understand that it "is something you frack, something you force out of the stone by pumping fluid into the cracks". Every drop adds up. Johnson saw the world this way, and had done since he was a toddler (2,700 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/3079e74e?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

The Allure Of Catholic Conversion [https://thebrowser.com/r/d206bb74?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Guy Stagg | Engelsberg Ideas | 29th January 2026 | U

Review of a book about the move towards Catholicism in 20C Britain. Bucking the general trend towards secularisation, over 40,000 people became Catholics in England in Wales between 1910 and 1960. Among them were prominent writers like Evelyn Waugh, G.K. Chesterton and Muriel Spark. Why? The elaborate, exotic-seeming rituals appealed to some, while others simply liked to be different (1,200 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/99b0a9bc?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Another London [https://thebrowser.com/r/5e595548?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Hari Kunzru | Harper's | 21st January 2026 | B

Londoner, who departed 18 years ago for New York, returns to the city and walks the eight miles southeast from John Dee's black mirror in the British Museum to Greenwich, site of the prime meridian. It's a walk through time as well as space, with memories of the 1980s huddled alongside history from the 18C and earlier. Alan Moore is a guiding spirit. An excellent work of psycho-geography (7,000 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/f014ce2d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Iran's Ultimate Banned Book [https://thebrowser.com/r/a291df4a?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Amir Ahmadi Arian | Dial | 15th January 2026 | U

No text captures Iran's contradictions as well as the 1936 novella The Blind Owl. Sadegh Hedayat's book holds the distinction of having been banned both before and after the 1979 revolution. Its ambiguous, symbol-laden narrative follows a mediocre painter through his obsession with a beautiful woman, whom he kills, and then his awakening as "the old, Quran-reciting man he most despises" (3,700 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/debb2af8?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])
