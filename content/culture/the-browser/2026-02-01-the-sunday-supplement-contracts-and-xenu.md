The Coasian Inferno [https://thebrowser.com/r/3c7fd32d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Alex Harrowell | Yorkshire Ranter | 31st January 2018

“What have US healthcare, British railways, the shipwreck of Carillion plc, and the F-35 got in common? Well — none of them works terribly well, they all cost vastly more than expected, and nobody can put their finger on why. Cash seems to leak out of them by a thousand cuts, without necessarily ending up with a well-defined villain. Productivity is stubbornly terrible and improvement forever delayed. We’ve lived through a giant experiment in proving Ronald Coase wrong, which has now failed” (1,600 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/cac218a3?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Alec Nevala-Lee | Longreads | 1st February 2017

How L. Ron Hubbard evolved from a writer of short stories to the founder of a religion. “Hubbard churned out science fiction to meet the demands of his editors, and he built a religion around it because it appealed to his initial circle of followers, many of whom were fans who had first encountered his work in magazines like Astounding. He didn’t choose his disciples; they chose him. And he told them what they wanted to hear until he was transformed in the process” (7,700 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/6263ea17?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

It’s time for the January Browser Book Club, our first edition of 2026. What did you read this month, and what did you think of it?

Last week’s question

We recommended JA Westenberg’s A Metabolic Workspace [https://thebrowser.com/r/73e847f2?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd], outlining a note-taking system where “the idea is to try to invert the premise of personal knowledge management”, and digest rather than store.

> Do you have a system for noting new information and ideas? What does it look like?

From specialist apps to favourite notebooks, a noteworthy mailbag [https://thebrowser.com/r/95e6e382?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd] of note-taking schemes. You have a variety of goals in mind: contemplation, linking new ideas, mulching, trips down memory lane — and simplicity.

Book Of The Week

The Astronomer and the Witch: Johannes Kepler’s Fight for his Mother | Ulinka Rublack [https://thebrowser.com/r/3592cea3?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Recommended by Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger at Five Books: [https://thebrowser.com/r/089a5990?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

“This is really an ingenious idea to thematize Johannes Kepler, one of the most famous astronomers of all time... What is less well known is that Kepler’s widowed mother was accused of being a witch in 1620. So, Kepler gave up his research for some time and took over the legal defence of his mother... What’s really stunning is that he either believed in witchcraft, or, if he didn’t believe in it, he didn’t call it into question. So, he reckoned with the possibility that there was something like witchcraft, but he tried to prove why, in the case of his mother, it wasn’t involved. This shows something very important about what we are used to calling the Scientific Revolution, namely, that in early modern times, you could not separate magic from science. Actually, what we today would call experimental science was called ‘natural magic’ then. It is only with hindsight that you can distinguish what proved to be scientific knowledge and what proved later to be superstition. A lot of recipes—what we would today call medicine or pharmacy—were then considered to be a kind of magic knowledge.”
