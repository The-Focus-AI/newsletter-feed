The Rare People Who Are Solid [https://thebrowser.com/r/07883111?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Sasha Chapin | 12th January 2026 | U

“If you are highly congruent, you disown none of your experience. You accept the stubborn approach of death, the arbitrariness of your fortune, your unimportance on the cosmic timescale, your potential importance for the local environment. Although congruence is a source of endless happiness, the path there can be devastating. You may have to finally give up on experiencing a better past” (1,500 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/d4b41aa5?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Why The Iranian Regime Seems Invincible [https://thebrowser.com/r/9c28093d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Anonymous Iranian | Persuasion | 8th January 2026 | U

The Islamic Republic is a maze of power with two parallel governments. Over the years, it has created a class of people who benefit from the regime and another class who enforce it. “Leaderless protests are brave, but fragile.” Potential leaders are arrested or killed immediately. Much of the world has a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. Iranians distrust foreign intervention, with good reason (1,400 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/da55e970?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Desperately Seeking Squircles [https://thebrowser.com/r/530f9825?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Daniel Furse | Figma | 3rd April 2018 | U

Engineer embarks on a mathematical odyssey to try and understand the "squircle" shape that Apple uses for its app icons. "This may seem trivial, a cool story, but subconsciously it really makes a big impact: a squircle doesn’t look like a square with surgery performed on it; it registers as an entity in its own right, like the shape of a smooth pebble in a riverbed, a unified and elemental whole" (5,900 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/d7b16977?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Very Good Music Facts [https://thebrowser.com/r/710b3302?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

If you’re at a party and need something to talk about, this compendium of music trivia should come in handy. Bruno Mars was nicknamed after pro-wrestler Bruno Sammartino because he was a chubby baby. Coldplay sent a formal request via lawyers to Kraftwerk to use the “Computer Love” melody. Weeks later, they received a reply from Kraftwerk’s Ralf Hütter, containing only a handwritten “yes” (1,400 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/de3972f9?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

We're All Just Content For ICE [https://thebrowser.com/r/d08a7de5?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Ryan Broderick | Garbage Day | 12th January 2026 | U

Raw reportage from Minneapolis during Trump's immigration raids. In addition to the brutality, the writer saw first hand how the propaganda is generated: "Brutal state violence and hysterical right-wing internet content work together in lockstep." Substackers and YouTubers are given a ring-side seat to the offensive. The ICE agents themselves seem to lack training and basic weapons skills (1,800 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/2160e98e?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])
