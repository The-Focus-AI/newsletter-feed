The Dilbert Afterlife [https://thebrowser.com/r/023c883a?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Scott Alexander | Astral Codex Ten | 16th January 2026 | U

Lengthy eulogy for Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert. “Adams knew, deep in his bones, that he was cleverer than other people. God always punishes this impulse, especially in nerds. He created Adams only-slightly-above-average at everything except for a Mozart-tier skill at making silly comics about hating work. Too self-aware to deny it, too narcissistic to accept it, he spent his life searching for a loophole” (10,400 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/b6856d3b?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Japanese Death Poems [https://thebrowser.com/r/6c3b67ef?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Roger’s Bacon | Secretorum | 17th January 2026 | U

Compendia of Jisei, a centuries-old Japanese tradition of poems written in one’s last moments. Some are vivid: “Cherry blossoms fall on a half-eaten dumpling”. Some are prosaic: “I wake up from a seventy-five-year dream to millet porridge”. Some are humorous: “Raizan has died to pay for the mistake of being born: for this he blames no one, and bears no grudge”. Nearly all of them are astonishing (2,600 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/7cf46b8e?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Life And Death By Mountain Lion [https://thebrowser.com/r/846c22e1?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Craig Childs | Last Word On Nothing | 19th January 2026 | U

What are the odds of being killed by a mountain lion on a hiking trail in North America? Exceptionally low, but not non-existent. In the last 150 years, mountain lions have killed 30-40 people. Cows kill that many in a year or two. Mountain lions are a “wary” and “retiring” predator, closer in temperament to the docile cheetah than the Asian and African leopard, which kills hundreds of people per year (1,000 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/37024c50?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

Our Collective Obsession With Boredom [https://thebrowser.com/r/cb30a773?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Kristen French & James Danckert | Nautilus | 17th January 2026 | M

Interview with a boredom researcher, who corrects popular misconceptions. Famous people often say, “I was bored, so I did X”, which might lead us to infer that boredom aids creativity. This has it backwards. Researchers have found the opposite to be true: the more bored people got, the less creative they were. Creativity is a great answer to boredom, but “you can’t hope that it works the other way around” (3,900 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/4abeb380?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])

The Tree Farm [https://thebrowser.com/r/7770625f?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd]

Cal Flyn | Granta | 11th January 2016 | U

A journey northward from Inverness in search of the trees and forests of Scotland — the ancient, the ruined, the lost-for-ever. “They call this the Flow Country, from the Old Norse flóa, meaning flood, the closest thing Britain has to subarctic tundra...One’s eye may roam for miles all around, unfettered, over empty lands where once there were trees, and then there were people, and now there is nothing” (6,300 words [https://thebrowser.com/r/dacf5d9c?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd])
