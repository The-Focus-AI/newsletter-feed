# Twenty Twenty Frixx

**Jessica DeFino** wrote that “[we’re friction-maxxing](https://jessicadefino.substack.com/p/thutt)” according to **P.E. Moskowitz** who wrote that “[everyone is friction-maxxing these days](https://mentalhellth.xyz/p/how-i-frictionmaxx)“ according to **Kathryn Jezer-Morton** who wrote that “[In 2026, We Are Friction-Maxxing](https://www.thecut.com/article/brooding-friction-maxxing-new-years-2026-resolution.html).” Call it twenty twenty frixx. What’s friction-maxxing? It’s like hygge in goblin mode. It’s the dark academia of trad. It’s brat summer but chopped and screwed. It’s [getting your concussy slonked](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/getting-my-concussy-slonked-silly-style-17b0)… _serious_ style. 

Some friction emerged this week in the normally well lubricated “Heated Rivalry” fan community, where hockey podcast “[Empty Netters](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/empty-netters-podcast/id1648832044)” has recently converted itself into more of a “Heated Rivalry” fancast, with [allyship levels](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/30/arts/podcasts-2025-heavyweight-gilmore.html) approaching [**Nev Schulman**](https://web.archive.org/web/20140912065337/http://jezebel.com/nev-schulman-declares-his-elevator-abuse-free-internet-1632370881)[ in an elevator](https://web.archive.org/web/20140912065337/http://jezebel.com/nev-schulman-declares-his-elevator-abuse-free-internet-1632370881) (#RESPECT). But yesterday, _OutSports_’ **Cyd Zeigler** reported that one of the show’s cohosts [privately sent texts calling the hockey romance’s creators “cowards” and “losers.”](https://www.outsports.com/2026/1/22/24126217/empty-netters-heated-rivalry-host-dan-powers-show-trash-podcast/)  

Today the host in question, **A Jon Favreau Type**,[1](#b-9fb7e427-5820-4a0c-83c1-5699fc6a06c5) [responded to these claims in a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=FMFF2EVmyCY) along with his co-host and brother, **Young Ron Howard**. The co-bros showed the entire text conversation in context, criticized a lack of legitimate effort by Zeigler to reach them for comment before the story was published, and then effusively bemoaned, at what felt like great length, the harm this scurrilous bit of character assassination has done to The Whole Community. Personally, I thought the apology seemed sincere and genuine—as far as it went. Unfortunately, [every Youtube commenter noticed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMFF2EVmyCY&lc=UgzZelEz6_b0f8fUozF4AaABAg) that A.J.F.T. never got around to mentioning or apologizing for the text thread’s contemptuous references to “blue-haired twitter” and “check[ing] inclusivity boxes.”

As a noted straight myself and a student of the heterosexual community, my diagnosis here is an acute case of [No Gay Friends](https://www.out.com/voices/gay-straight-friendships). Even just one (1) gay friend could have cast an eye over this response video and said “hey this is great stuff, A.J.F.T., but what did you _mean_ by ‘blue-haired twitter’ though? And where are we checking these ‘inclusivity boxes’ exactly? Are there forms being distributed amongst the straights?” And to add one more question: what do you mean you’re “DYING for a good, quality, well written and AUTHENTIC hockey show” when [season five of “Shoresy” literally just came out](https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/shoresy-season-5-release-date-renewed-season-6-1236637490/)?

Friction may be bad for rotational motion, but friction-maxxing hasn’t stopped a pivot yet. Our Former Regrettable Platform [Substack is pivoting to video, again, this time with a TV app](https://www.theverge.com/news/866054/substack-tv-app-beta-launch-newsletters). “Video… needs to be wherever someone chooses to consume it” [says normal-type word making person ](https://on.substack.com/p/introducing-the-substack-tv-app-now)**[Chris Cillizza](https://on.substack.com/p/introducing-the-substack-tv-app-now)**. Where will you consume video? What location will you choose to shove video into your gaping hole and suck it down your slavering gullet? That’s right piggy, gobble it up. You love consuming video. 

Americans are [pivoting to not murdering each other anymore](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/us/murder-rate-drop-report.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share). Why? 

“Charles Fain Lehman, a senior fellow at the Policing and Public Safety Initiative of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, pointed to changes like the aging of America, increased obesity, and the ubiquity of surveillance through security and cellphone cameras.“ — 

We’re just too old and fat for doing murders now. Normal opinions everywhere today. Lehman is also [an ](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/charles-fain-lehman/)_[Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/charles-fain-lehman/)_[ contributor](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/charles-fain-lehman/), of course.

AI company Anthropic (_disclosure: I am not dating anyone at Anthropic)_ has to keep [pivoting to technical interview questions that job applicants can’t use its product to cheat on](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/anthropic-has-to-keep-revising-its-technical-interview-test-so-you-cant-cheat-on-it-with-claude/), reported **Russell Brandom**. Huh! I feel like everyone is already right on the edge with all this so let’s just move on. **Bari Weiss** is [pausing her podcast](https://www.rawstory.com/bari-weiss-cbs-news/#) and pivoting to devote her full attention to [being loathed by everyone at CBS](https://www.status.news/p/bari-weiss-60-minutes-cecot-report). And video site Vimeo, recently acquired by [Italian corporate vampire Bending Spoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending_Spoons), is pivoting to [being an empty husk of a company](https://www.webpronews.com/vimeo-hit-with-mass-layoffs-after-1-38b-bending-spoons-buyout/), to be drained of all remaining value and then quietly murdered.
