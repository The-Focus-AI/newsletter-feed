What it has always looked like

Fiction by Luke O’Neil

October 18, 2025

The four of us stumbled out across the sand in the dark toward where the tongue of the water lapped at the high tide line and stood silently for some time listening to the collected absences. The universal and the personal. My god the stars are so close and low up here one of us said and we all looked up in unison. 

I thought of the Laura Gilpin poem about the two-headed calf. Then the Vincent D’Onofrio tweet about the pig. 

A dwindling bonfire up around the bend of the shoreline. 

Should I put on some music someone said and we all said sure by which we meant please do not and that was that. It was well past the end of the season and going to be cold at this time of night either way but the call of the water was persistent. 

How much would it take for you to jump in right now one of us said and we all thought about it for a minute or two. Calculating the relative severity of wind and squealing distance back to the cottage. I guess I would do it for like $200 one of us said and it was deflating because it wasn’t enough to be excited about. No one gets a little jolt up the spine over $200. 

They really were quite close and low though. These stars. This is what everything is supposed to look like I thought. What it has always looked like. I never thought I was any good at spotting the Big Dipper but turns out it’s just right there. Has been this entire time. Looming like a postcard town’s church steeple. 

I thought of one of those videos where they put glasses on a blind baby and it sees its parents for the first time. Everyone crying. In the video and the people watching at home too. 

I felt the presence of my phone in my pocket whispering to me to try to take a picture of it all to alert the world to what the world actually is but then snapped to my senses and stood down. 

I cannot translate this for any of you. Cannot break this news. 

It’s no wonder that almost every story we ever told ourselves about creation came from people who drove themselves mad staring at all of this light above us. 

I didn’t even get around to the full moon yet. Pregnant to bursting.

You could dream of something better even now if you looked at it all for too long. Maybe that’s why they had to dull the sky with toil and industry. A barricade against the divine. 

----------------------------------------

 

Genesis 

[1:1] On the seventh day God rested. 

[1.2] And for the six days straight before that as well. 

[1.3] lol resting whips ass he said. 

[1.4] It was all formless and empty 

and always would be. 

[1.5] And none of any of this ever happened to any of us. 

[1.6] We were all resting too. 

----------------------------------------

 

Paperwork 

Ah crap my perceived in-group status didn’t shield me from the inevitable violence of fascism. I had been really counting on that. That was my load-bearing identity. 

I never caused any kind of fuss to be clear. Kept my head down. All in all it bought me maybe fifteen months tops. Which isn’t so bad all things considered. And come to think of it was I not entitled to that reprieve? A kind of reward for my loyalty if you looked at it a certain way. 

Or more likely it’s possible there had been some kind of mistake. A snafu in the filing system. Oh hold on a sec they’re calling my name right now. I’m going to bring it up. I’ve got all my papers in order right here. 

----------------------------------------

 

The rules 2

I was trying to buy happiness with the power of cold hard cash and just really getting my ass handed to me. A total bloodbath. I figured the bankers would have declared me the winner by now but they were saying they don’t accept bitcoin at the contentment factory. The only other people I knew socially were trying to buy happiness with the power of cold hard cash too and they weren’t having a great go of it either. I kept trying to explain in between haymakers how many homes I had around the world. That the most powerful politicians answered my phone calls promptly. Millions of followers online. A series of beautiful ex-wives and farflung children. And on top of that it was likely to all be sorted out once my lawyers had had a crack at the case. And yet I was in my penthouse bleeding profusely from the mouth and nose. It spilled out of me onto the gorgeous tile of the cavernous bathroom in a pattern that if you sort of squinted at it from the right vantage looked like a heart button on the phone. See that I pointed. I get tens of thousands of those on every post I tried to say through my broken teeth. Alright well now he was laughing with beloved friends. Sharing moments of joy and selfless generosity with one another. I didn’t think we were allowed do that.

Sex Tourist

by Rax King [https://flaminghydra.com/r/3f3f88c2?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

Kim Cattrall [https://flaminghydra.com/r/6f6236be?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] in Sex and the City (1998) [https://flaminghydra.com/r/fb7a9c67?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

In an early episode of Sex and the City, the girls leave Manhattan to visit their pregnant friend Laney at her mansion in Connecticut. At the baby shower, Laney derisively asks, of promiscuous Samantha, “Is she still bar-hopping and bed-hopping? Isn’t it sad when that’s all you have?” Her point, with which the show’s protagonists would contend over and over again, was that sportfucking bartenders was like chasing shadows on a cave wall; only in a monogamous marriage with children, like her own, could one hope to step into the sun. 

Only a couple years before, she was the one partying across Manhattan in between arduous days at her A&R job. Now she’s been claimed, domesticated, and bred. The envy is palpable in her pious dig at Samantha: she needs to believe that bar-hopping and bed-hopping is something she’s simply too mature for now.

We’ve changed since that 1998 episode. My fellow slutty girls are wearing fewer scarlet A’s than they used to, and anyone who wants to know whether women can “have it all” knows to ask it ironically, with scare quotes. Still, it’s been tough to shake the pernicious idea that bar-hopping and bed-hopping are mere recreational activities, especially for women. Bars and beds are where we hide from our responsibilities. Where we go to delay “growing up.”

Unfortunately, this idea pairs well with the mounting pressure for women to get back in the kitchen and stay there until their nests are empty. Even people who don’t explicitly believe in such regressive notions may struggle to avoid practicing them. During the pandemic [https://flaminghydra.com/r/0e6d7c84?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], women were overwhelmingly the ones who left their jobs to tend the home and children, a sacrifice few men even seemed to notice [https://flaminghydra.com/r/f9dbc788?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. Presumably the 2,200 people surveyed by Morning Consult in 2020 were all over the cultural and political spectrum, not just in the swampy basements of the manosphere or mommy-bloggish McMansions like Laney’s. But the results of the survey would seem to assert that, for women, the party is over. Time to pick a bed and stay there like a mature adult.

Fuck that, says I, because I would never have matured at all without my own bar-hopping and bed-hopping. Now, I’m sober nearly four years and God willing I’ll be sober for many more. I cook briskets, I dust tables, I successfully wrangled a bachelor’s degree. I married a good man in 2023. I pay taxes on time and in full—hell, I’ve even been known to pop a multivitamin. On paper, I’m a slightly hipper Laney. I certainly don’t seem like I learned everything on my back while examining the water damage in some man’s ceiling. But in fact, I wouldn’t even know how to recognize water damage if just such a man hadn’t shamefacedly explained to me what that big puffy stain was. Those early sex partners taught me what being a human being meant, the dullness and exhilaration of it, how a single day might start with a scary number on a cholesterol report and end with a 23-year-old stripper blowing you in the shower.

In my twenties, I knew girls who had traveled Europe and seen castles and ancient villages. I knew girls who entered the workforce through internships, who learned to write in grad school. That worked if you had family money, initiative, or the dreaded “stick-to-it-iveness,” but I had a junk addiction and eleven bucks in checking, and I met my postgraduate education where it was at. Most dive bars had at least one grim-faced guy from another country who could be pressed to describe his people’s customs—there’s your Europe. As for learning to write, you can do a lot worse than scarring yourself all over with men and drugs and then seeking the right words for how that felt. This wasn’t a childish postponement of real life. My life was no less real for being messy.

I had a friend in those years whose company I sought out specifically because it made me feel like a fuck-up, because I was trying to see my bar-hopping and bed-hopping as the shitty thing I had, holding me back from the glorious thing I didn’t. It wasn’t exactly fun I was having out there. I meant it when I called my youthful promiscuity my “postgraduate education,” no less rigorous for being unaccredited, but I only landed on that framework much later—at the time I agreed with the received wisdom that diligently sleeping around meant slacking off in some much more important sector of life. And if this was what slacking off looked like, I needed to spend time with people who appeared to be doing the opposite. I thought I needed to feel bad about not feeling bad.

No, I didn’t feel guilty, but the fact remained that I had four roommates packed into two bedrooms, and I clocked into work most mornings straight from a night of partying; my friend worked in a prestigious art gallery and went home to a tastefully appointed loft that she shared with no one. She had two masters’ degrees, she was on a first name basis with Noam Chomsky. Her family’s name was on university buildings while mine appeared in a bluegrass song about running corn liquor. We’d get together periodically and I’d root and chuff through her experiences like a hog hunting truffle. Somewhere in there was the secret. 

I didn’t want this friend’s specific life. I don’t know dick about art, and all my earthly belongings couldn’t fill the walk-in closet of one of those giant Williamsburg lofts. But the stuff of her increasingly grown-up life, the knowledge and wisdom she was amassing about how to exist, had come to her through the proper channels, or so it appeared. Not so with me. Sex was the origin point for damn near everything I had. The secret was not to obtain all her advantages, but to work what I could to mine. I knew I was sexy, funny, and observant to the point of spookiness. Surely I could become something off those qualities. Not a homeowner or a CEO, but something.

I came to see—and, frankly, still see—my promiscuity as a form of tourism; a way of seeing and knowing the world. That angle strikes me as the real reason for Laney’s jab. Weighed down by the tedium of pregnant suburban joblessness, it’s natural to covet and therefore denigrate the carefree snatching up of experiences that erotic tourists, like Samantha and me, were enjoying. Usually “sex tourism” describes gross old white guys who fly to countries where the dollar is strong so they can buy sex with young locals, but I think my version is more in line with what tourism’s supposed to be: enriching, offering participants access to experiences and viewpoints they’d never encounter otherwise. I couldn’t buy that enrichment through the approved channels, but I could visit other worlds in other homes, other beds. 

Indeed, that was half the appeal. I was a shy and withdrawn girl who’d been blessed or cursed, depending on how you look at it, with a coruscating sexual charisma. I would never be the life of the party, but men and women alike were always inviting me to go somewhere private with them, to snort off their keys and eat on their dime. The act itself was a minor element of my sex tourism. Desire drove me, while nosiness kept me there after the sex was over. It was all hunger of one sort or another. I wanted these people, to be sure, but what I really wanted was to know what all of them did every second of the day, and what they kept in their bedside table drawers, how many times a week they masturbated, whether they got along with their mothers, how much money they made doing what kind of job. I went to their homes as often as I could, citing my many roommates, but mostly so I could spy better. Stealing from my partners shamelessly—their tics, their knowledge, their interests.

Their belongings, too—I might as well admit that now. Little mementoes from all those other lives littered my bedroom like so many souvenir T-shirts. I wasn’t looking for big-ticket items I could pawn or some such deviousness; I was building a nest. One guy’s plastic rosary necklace hung jauntily on my wall, looking severe and elegant in my mostly spartan bedroom, and I smiled every time I remembered palming the thing in his palatial Annapolis home. I wore another guy’s beanie in winter and a third guy’s scarf. My sheets, at least, were a legitimate souvenir, bought as a housewarming present by my former sugar mama; my favorite pillowcase was not. It was nothing special, just Target brand, but I stored it carefully so that it still smelled like the loft of the artist I’d snatched it from. Rubber eraser and charcoal.

I made a home out of people whose names I mostly can’t remember now, and I made a self out of them, too. Out of Adam who bought me my first ever sushi dinner and didn’t laugh at me for being unable to work my chopsticks; out of Justin who couldn’t believe I’d never seen Boogie Nights until I met him. Oh, they could never believe what I hadn’t seen and where I hadn’t been and all the things I hadn’t done. Some of them lost interest because of it, but most were eager to share what they had for a little while. And I was an eager pupil.

With all this life behind me, I rewatch Sex and the City now and am surprised to recall that I once found it so liberating. It taught me that women could sleep around without “ruining” themselves, and I was so grateful for the message that I failed to see the essential flatness of my beloved Samantha’s life. A man might turn up for a single episode to fuck, leave, and inspire puns over brunch, on the show as in life. But on the show such a man never left any experiential residue. Samantha was my role model for loving sex, but I wish the show made a better case for why she loved it, beyond the obvious animal drive towards orgasms. Climax accounted for a mere thirty seconds of an act that begins with a glance and ends with a smeary-faced walk home, and the show was far less interested in all the scheming and desperation of the hours in between than I was. I’m not sure how many men Samantha sleeps with over the series’ run, but I’ve rewatched it enough times to know that few of them leave even the faintest footprints in her life. My own life is muddied, tamped down all over with footprints. And isn’t that what adulthood ought to be? Whether we grow up in bars or beds or more reputable institutions, don’t we all hope to come through those experiences a little transformed?

I miss the days when wanting someone meant wanting to take from them, or maybe to occupy them somehow—when desire was still so much about becoming. That was the thing I outgrew, not the bar-hopping and bed-hopping itself. The sweet and fizzy sexuality of my youth has distilled into something too potent, too intense, to accommodate my old wanderlust. If I were somehow forced back into the sexual marketplace, my promiscuity would look very different. There’s something so vulnerable about a tourist, so breakable, this badly dressed goober practically begging to be mugged, behaving with the abandon of rootlessness. That abandon is no longer available to me, I don’t think. In any promiscuous tourist future I can imagine, I’d be the jaded townie selling the destination T-shirts, not the exuberant traveler buying them. As it turns out, wanting a person is an awfully stark business when you actually do want the person, rather than just a brief vacation in their life.

At the end of Sex and the City’s original tenure on HBO, before fans knew to expect two decades of sequels and prequels, all four girls found their way to contented monogamy and stayed there. Charlotte and Miranda had happy marriages; Samantha and Smith adored each other; Carrie finally snatched romance from the jaws of indifference with Mr. Big. For the whole last season, that meant no more whimsical sidebars with one-off dates like Funky Spunk Guy or Mr. Pussy. We never saw Laney again after her baby shower but I wonder whether it may have been some relief for her to watch the girls, even Samantha, choose stability over stories. Maybe they just no longer needed those sorts of adventure tales. Their sex tourism days were behind them. They’d learned enough.
