‘Heated Rivalry’ Gives Everyone Permission

by Annalee Newitz [https://flaminghydra.com/r/5b94c9e8?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

Not since I discovered Star Trek: The Next Generation have I fallen as hard for a show as I did for gay hockey series Heated Rivalry. It’s not merely the show, however; it’s the glorious fandom, which amplifies and extends the latent meanings in the story, creating community around a sequence of fictional events. Even Mayor Zohran Mamdani recognized this recently, when he encouraged New Yorkers [https://flaminghydra.com/r/cd0dc09c?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] to stay home during the January ice storm and take advantage of the New York Public Library’s offer of waitlist-free access to the books that Heated Rivalry is based on.

What exactly is this show? Saying that it’s about a years-long closeted fuckfest between pro hockey players is like saying that Star Trek is about people driving a spaceship around the galaxy. Heated Rivalry is about love in a time of danger; it’s about figuring out who you are while under the constant hostile surveillance that comes with fame and social media. Most importantly, the show presents a permission structure for expressing desires that our culture rejects.

I think this is why Heated Rivalry has become such a mesmerizing narrative in dark times, breaking out of the margins of romance fandom to become a mainstream hit in North America and beyond. It is a show that encourages us to fall in love—and, in the process, to reimagine ourselves and the world.

The Letterkenny connection

I believe we enter new fandoms through doors that are already cracked open. In the case of Heated Rivalry, some came to the show because they were already fans of Rachel Reid’s books, or of romance fiction more broadly. Some were fans of hot male-on-male action, while others were diehard hockey fans.

And a few, like myself, came to the show through one of the lesser-known alleyways. I was a fan of Heated Rivalry creator and writer Jacob Tierney, whose work on the Canadian cult comedy Letterkenny had long ago won my heart and undying loyalty. When other fans ask if I’m more of an Ilya or a Shane, my answer is: “Um, I’m more of a … Jacob?” 

Tierney was a co-developer, writer, and director on the 12-season series about life in the tiny Ontario town of Letterkenny. He also played the part of Pastor Glen, the extremely chaotic and closeted fem foil to the show’s hyper-masc, stoic farmer Wayne (played by Letterkenny creator and writer Jared Keeso).

 

[https://flaminghydra.com/r/7006e854?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

Though Glen’s yearning for Wayne remains unrequited, their relationship feels like a harbinger of the central romance in Heated Rivalry. Glen, like Ilya, is the messy gay, reveling in sexual innuendo. Wayne is the socially awkward, neurospicy one, like Shane. 

Above, Tierney is on the left and Keeso on the right. It’s the same energy as Shane and Ilya, below.

I loved Letterkenny for its foul-mouthed wordplay, obscure Canadianisms, and general horniness. But I was also uneasy about the broad gay stereotype that Tierney wrote for himself and chose to play. It felt to me, in my fannish parasocial identification with him, as if he might be dealing with internalized homophobia. Especially because he has said in interviews [https://flaminghydra.com/r/d500a59a?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] that he identifies as masc, and spent his early acting career terrified that someone would out him.

Still, over the seasons, it was obvious that Tierney was growing bolder about bringing queerness into Letterkenny [https://flaminghydra.com/r/a435310e?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. Especially hockey-tinged queerness. By season four, Letterkenny had introduced two gay gym rats who “chirp” at two straight hockey players in this incredible scene full of hockey lingo sex puns:

 

[https://flaminghydra.com/r/620aa093?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

The four characters subsequently become friends, and their jock adventures together extend over several seasons, including in one memorable episode where they compete to fuck the most people (the gay guys win obviously). Tierney’s character Glen also changes dramatically over the course of the series, becoming an ice cream vendor, a bartender, and even a public access TV station manager, though he continues to play Glen as a bizarro Canadian version of Truman Capote.

I used to tweet about Letterkenny quite a bit in the halcyon days of Twitter. Once I tweeted at Jacob Tierney that my headcanon [https://flaminghydra.com/r/ab140c58?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] is that his character Glen comes out of the closet and moves to Montreal, where he becomes a hot bartender and hooks up with tons of guys. Tierney liked my post and started following me, much to my delight. 

Now imagine, dear reader, how I felt when Tierney finally made a show about hot gay guys getting laid, set mostly in Montreal. Was it because of my tweet? 

Queer fulfillment

If Letterkenny is what happened when the show and its director grew progressively more open about their queerness, Heated Rivalry is its perfect consummation. Heated Rivalry’s entire narrative arc is a permission structure. By that I mean that both the psychological mechanism and the literal plot structure of the show build and build, ultimately giving Ilya, Shane, and the audience permission to be queer—whatever that may mean to us, in all our complicated lives and lethal political environments.

----------------------------------------

 

In the first episode of Heated Rivalry, Shane and Ilya do a classic sports movie bit, getting sweaty together in the gym and sharing a bottle of water suggestively.

 

[https://flaminghydra.com/r/07a82e70?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

How many scenes like this have we watched before, in war flicks, crime shows, buddy comedies, the latest Marvel movie, whatever—“manly” scenes dripping with homoeroticism, where we’re nevertheless expected to believe that nothing erotic is going on. But Heated Rivalry doesn’t condescend to the audience with some nonsensical heterosexual reason for the boys to stare at each other’s bodies. They want to fuck, and soon enough, they do. 

This is the opposite of queerbaiting [https://flaminghydra.com/r/7ced0f93?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], where queer desire is hinted at only in subtext—or aroused only in order to have it snatched away. This is queer fulfillment. And it’s a signal of where the show is about to take us.

For queer fans like me, who are sick of the hetero-pretense in other bro-centric stories, the show’s opening fuck montages feel like a cure for gaslighting. Yes, it seems to say, all those other times when sweaty dudes gazed longingly at each other on screen, you were not crazy to yell, “Kiss!!” 

The complexity of the closet

Heated Rivalry’s third episode introduces a story parallel to Ilya and Shane’s, in which star hockey player Scott falls for Kip, a grad student who works at a smoothie place in New York. After they hook up, Scott explains to Kip in a painful scene that he can’t come out until “hockey is over” for him. It would wreck his career, but that’s not the only issue: “Too many people depend on me,” he says. If he comes out, he fears he will endanger the livelihoods of his teammates, trainers, managers, and others.

Scott’s economic concerns are compounded by the fact that he lives in the surveillance prison of fame. Every move he makes is covered by the media; even visiting a gallery with Kip gives him a panic attack because he’s afraid he’ll be recognized. Ilya and Shane have the same worries, magnified by their public image as competitors who hate each other. They can’t be seen together publicly at all, because it would undermine the rivalry narrative their fans expect.

Heated Rivalry is about the complexities of the closet. Though we supposedly live in an era of LGBT openness, social and economic pressures are still preventing people from coming out. In the United States, where LGBT rights are being rolled back and politicians have targeted trans people for destruction, many queer people are beginning to fear for their lives and those of their loved ones. In many other countries, the situation is even more dire.

On top of the obvious pressures, there is also no singular “closet” from which one can emerge permanently and unambiguously. You might be out to some people and not others, or out about some parts of your sexuality but not others. Coming out is an ongoing process, and those of us who come out generally have to do it a million different times before we die. Heated Rivalry acknowledges all this, and yet never turns our story into a tragedy. Instead of insisting that the arc of every queer life revolves around coming out, the show gives its characters permission to come out partially, or slowly, or not at all.

Queer joy is always possible, and coming out isn’t the only way to find it.

That’s not to say it doesn’t matter. Fan-favorite Episode 5 is about the power of coming out, and the ripple effects it can have. After winning the Stanley Cup, Scott has no more fucks to give; he invites Kip out onto the ice to give him a long, romantic kiss in front of a crowd of millions. Watching this unfold on TV in their separate homes, Ilya and Shane grow wide-eyed. Ilya instantly calls Shane and delivers the line that rocked their fandom: “I’m coming to the cottage.” 

 

[https://flaminghydra.com/r/c37078d8?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

(This is a callback to an earlier scene, where Shane invited Ilya to stay at his secluded cottage in Quebec. Terrified that they might be discovered, Ilya refuses—until Scott’s bravery inspires him to take the leap.) 

Hudson Williams [https://flaminghydra.com/r/9ee36087?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] and Connor Storrie [https://flaminghydra.com/r/951b48e0?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] in Heated Rivalry (2025) [https://flaminghydra.com/r/31f9d0c2?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

Meanwhile, in a real-life moment of resonance, Tierney gave Williams and Storrie permission to come out (or not) on their own terms. He and the show’s two leads, Hudson Williams (Shane) and Connor Storrie (Ilya) were interviewed by XTRA [https://flaminghydra.com/r/cdc8f086?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]’s Kevin Hurren back in November, right when the show was breaking out. Hurren asked the actors whether they thought they should “talk about their personal lives” because of the “conversation about queer people playing queer roles.” Williams and Storrie looked bewildered for an instant, and then Tierney jumped in:

> I don’t think there’s any reason to get into that stuff. I’ll tell you something about the casting of both of these roles. You can’t ask questions like that when you’re casting, right? It’s actually against the law. So what you have to gauge is somebody’s enthusiasm and willingness to do the work. And that’s what’s so impressive about both of these guys is they came into this being like, “Yeah, we’re here to do this, and we are here to make this story feel authentic and to be as real as possible.” And they fucking hit it out of the park. 

Fans went wild over this comment [https://flaminghydra.com/r/eb1cf130?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. It showed such confidence and care, and it effectively shut down an avenue of questioning that has at times led to the forced outing [https://flaminghydra.com/r/5ab7faba?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] of other young celebrities against their will. 

This is how Heated Rivalry’s permission structure continues through the boys’ tumultuous relationship and out into the world. When Ilya and Shane go to the cottage, it feels like we could all go with them. Beyond media surveillance, outside the cultural hate machine, we might love each other with the boys’ furious, horny innocence—or we might come together in whatever way we choose, in our own time, without judgement.
