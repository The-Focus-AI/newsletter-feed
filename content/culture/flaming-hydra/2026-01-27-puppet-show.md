The Peacekeepers

by Maria Bustillos [https://flaminghydra.com/r/b8d70f56?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

Donald Trump’s promised invasion or takeover or purchase of Greenland—which would have portended the end of NATO—appears to be off the table for now [https://flaminghydra.com/r/904b36b4?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], the result of a united front of opposition presented by the EU democracies. Trump’s belligerent and erratic threats against a NATO ally had sounded so deranged as to be meaningless—weird, outlandish, grandiose ravings—until troops arrived from France, Germany, the UK, Norway, and Sweden on January 15 to join the Danish forces already there to defend the Arctic island.

World leaders trying to deal with the Trump administration have begun to resemble characters in that queasy phase in a horror film where the innocent-looking alien specimen (that is about to devour everyone) is still being looked after and warily humored, but in an atmosphere of increasing dread. People have begun taking this president at his word.

The White House’s threats of invasion, as well as their kidnappings and deportations and establishment of secret police and concentration camps and pardoning of felons and hiding Venezuelan oil revenues offshore and the wholesale demolition of academic, public health, and scientific institutions all appear chaotic and insane, but everyone still has to try to somehow make sense of them. Possible explanations floated by pundits, politicians and other observers for the wildly destructive behavior of the White House include:

 * Distraction from DOJ refusal to release all the Epstein files
 * Trump’s dementia
 * Stupidity and incompetence; out of their depth
 * Greed: Doing the bidding of oligarchs
 * Fascism/eugenics, often in connection with Project 2025 and Christofascism

But there is another reading of far-right Republican behavior that explains it all better than any of the above, and dovetails with them all.

If the MAGA wing’s true goal is to destroy Western power, culture, politics, and alliances in order to set up a one-party authoritarian state allied with Russia (and likely other kleptocratic autocracies yet to be determined), their project of destruction has been entirely consistent. Viewed through this lens, MAGA’s every move has made all the sense in the world, ever since they first seized control of the Republican Party in 2016, and even before that.

It requires no sophistication in foreign policy to assemble credible evidence of this theory. Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian attempts to help Trump win the 2016 election indicted or got guilty pleas from 34 people [https://flaminghydra.com/r/bce14192?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], including Manafort, Trump campaign aide Rick Gates, and Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The story of increasing Republican connections to Russia and to Vladimir Putin have been written out plain as day in ordinary news stories, starting as early as 2001, quite early in George W. Bush’s first term.

> I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy. We had a very good dialogue. I was able to get a sense of his soul; a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country... I wouldn’t have invited him to my ranch, if I didn’t trust him.

----------------------------------------

 

By 2006 it was clear that Putin was tightening his authoritarian grip on Russia, and the Council on Foreign Relations released a report [https://flaminghydra.com/r/f28794c6?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] advising Bush to back off from regarding Russia as a “strategic partner.”

For all its flaws, the Obama administration took that message to heart, and a coolness set in.

----------------------------------------

 

In 2013 Donald Trump (who, as early as his 1987 book The Art of the Deal, had openly dreamed of building [https://flaminghydra.com/r/3df80ed0?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] “a large luxury hotel across the street from the Kremlin in partnership with the Soviet government”) arrived in earnest on the political horizon.

> I do have a relationship with [Putin]... he has really eaten our president’s lunch, let’s not kid ourselves... He’s put himself at the forefront of the world as a leader... I think that Putin has done an amazing job of showing certain leadership that our people have not been able to match.

----------------------------------------

 

Trump was quickly joined that year by a familiar gang of far-right, racist, misogynist throwbacks.

> Peoples all over the world, claims Putin, are supporting Russia’s “defense of traditional values” against a “so-called tolerance” that is “genderless and infertile.”
> 
> While his stance as a defender of traditional values has drawn the mockery of Western media and cultural elites, Putin is not wrong in saying that he can speak for much of mankind.

> Pat Buchanan, op-ed at Townhall, December 17, 2013 [https://flaminghydra.com/r/db723420?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

----------------------------------------

 

> If Russia is going to have a future, [Putin] must figure, it must be built on organic Russian traditions, which includes Orthodox Christianity [...] Putin is playing a long game here, a game that is far more serious and consequential for the survival of his country than American culture warriors can see.
> 
> Rod Dreher, American Conservative, December 18, 2013 [https://flaminghydra.com/r/45bfedf4?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

> There have been dramatic reforms in Russia that are not being recognized by my colleagues. The churches are full. There are opposition papers being distributed on every newsstand in Russia. You’ve got people demonstrating in the parks.

> The documents “would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,” read the email [to Donald Trump Jr.]… “This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”

----------------------------------------

 

The pro-Russian tone did not change after Trump won the election; the U.S. far right began lining up behind their president and his chum in Moscow.

> Vladimir Vladimirovich is not the president of a feminist NGO. He is not a transgender-rights activist. He is not an ombudsman appointed by the United Nations to make and deliver slide shows about green energy. He is the elected leader of Russia—a rugged, relatively poor, militarily powerful country that in recent years has been frequently humiliated, robbed, and misled.

One of the weirdest chapters of the story: a group of far-right Republican senators (and only Republicans) spent the Fourth of July 2018 in Moscow.

> I think you’d be hard-pressed to say that sanctions against Russia are really working all that well [...] I’ve been pretty upfront that the election interference — as serious as that was, and unacceptable — is not the greatest threat to our democracy. We’ve blown it way out of proportion.

> [Trump said that] the member nations of NATO have “not treated us fairly” because “we pay far too much and they pay far too little.”[…] Referring to a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week, Trump said, “Frankly, Putin may be the easiest of them all.”

Trump has had a large number of secret meetings and telephone conversations with Putin, sometimes forbidding any U.S. personnel to join him.

> Donald Trump: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.

As the Republican Party sides ever more boldly and openly with Russia against Europe, the world’s chances of preserving democracy, women’s rights and LGBTQ rights, voting rights, press freedom, education, freedom of information, and individual liberty will continue to slip away—Western civilization, you might call all that, for shorthand.
