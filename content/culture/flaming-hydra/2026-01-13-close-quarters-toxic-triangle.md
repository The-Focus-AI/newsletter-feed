Welcome Home

“At first, it’ll feel like the three of you are in a group chat,” Dr. Crane said. “But after a few weeks, internal communication gets to be so fast and smooth that it evolves into a single flow. Then you’ll know you’re really home.”

She smiled. She was pretty, not much older than me, with dark hair in a bun and fashionable glasses. I wondered what her salary was. I guessed she wouldn’t be needing to re-home anytime soon.

Jenna, Terrence and I had made the decision to re-home for a few reasons. We were all broke, for starters. After discussing with our parents we each managed to come up with the $2,400 to cover our respective share of the procedure. It was pricey upfront, but in the long run it would be much easier to materially support the lifespan of one body than three. We were all in our twenties, but as we got older illness would come quick, so it made sense to have all of us assembled in the best home; we would be able to afford housing and private care, rather than suffering apart. Everything was only getting more expensive, after all.

I took a breath and asked the big question.

“Whose body will we use?”

“Terrence’s adrenals are the strongest,” the doctor said, looking at her screen. “The process tends to favour males. Also, we prefer to use the term home when talking about the physical vessel.”

“Okay. So Terrence will be our new... home?”

“Yes. We’ll switch out the elements I mentioned from you and Jenna – your eyes and immune system, Jenna’s heart, and of course both of your consciousnesses,” she said. “Most re-homed people, once joined together, use the pronoun they, but sometimes people find it easier to settle on the singular to avoid confusion. Of course, the three of you can choose to identify however you like.”

I felt a pang of envy that Jenna’s heart would live on, coupled with a vague sense of wonder at the idea of living in the body of a biological man. Why was Jenna’s heart better than mine? Or better than Terrence’s for that matter? But we’d all been evaluated thoroughly. I couldn’t really argue.

Dr. Crane must have sensed my anxiety because she reached out and took my hand. Terrence and Jenna had already done their intake interviews; my chat with the doctor was the final hurdle.

“There’s nothing to worry about. You, Terrence and Jenna will sync up so well. Remember, we’ve done this thousands of times.”

I tried to calm myself down. “What will happen to our old homes?”

“Your old homes will be recycled. All useful tissues and materials will go to support the re-homing of the less fortunate.”

“Less fortunate?”“People who can’t afford to choose their new home,” she said. “Low-income individuals.”

“I heard something about that on the news.”

“Yes. Re-homing is now mandatory for those unable to provide for themselves.”

“Oh.”

Oddly, it was at that moment that I really understood that, even though my thoughts and my inner voice would live on, the process of re-homing would terminate my existence. Who was I if not my body?

The doctor seemed to anticipate exactly what I was feeling, as if she and I had already been placed together in a new home where we heard one another’s thoughts.

“You are not your body,” she said emphatically. “Everything you are, your personality, your quirks, your thoughts, ideas and feelings—that’s what we capture and imbue into your new home, along with the same qualities from your friends. Think of a single butterfly emerging from three connected cocoons. That’s what it’s like.”

It sounded more like three caterpillars were getting crammed into a single cocoon, with no butterfly emerging. Ever.

“What happens if we have an argument?” I asked. “In our new home. In Terrence. What if Jenna and I get into an argument? Or Terrence and I disagree about something?”

“Do you anticipate having conflicts with your co-inhabitants?”

“No,” I said. “Its not that. I just...” I sighed. “This is a big decision. I need to understand how these things work.”

Her gaze softened a little. A thin smile. “I understand. As I mentioned, over time the differentiation between your distinct consciousnesses, your inner voices, will disappear. Your thoughts and feelings will interweave to become one. It won’t be possible to disagree about anything.”

“What about in the meantime?” I said, my voice cracking.

“Achieving singularity takes between four and six months,” she said. “But for now, until the procedure, I suggest focusing on self-care.” She stood up and offered me her hand. 

“Try to enjoy this in-between time,” she said. “See you next week.”

----------------------------------------

 

“Hey,” I shouted above the music. “We should talk about this.”

Terrence was chatting with the bartender. I watched how he leaned on the bar with one elbow, his muscular frame well-proportioned and taut even under layers of clothing. Next to him, on a stool, Jenna sipped at her margarita, absorbed in her own thoughts. She looked thin, weak. Her wrists were half the size of Terrence’s. No wonder the doctors had picked him.

Terrence smiled. “What’s on your mind?” Jenna just nodded and looked back down at her drink.

I stepped closer to them and felt the presence and mass of their bodies, which, if all went as planned, would be fused into a single entity the following Tuesday. I was quiet for a few seconds, breathing them in, these strange creatures who, I suddenly realized, were totally alien to me. He smelled like aftershave and polyester, she like vanilla body wash. We were friends, but I knew nothing about them.

Jenna looked at me. “Are you still okay with it?”

“Yeah. I mean, I think so.” 

“Remember, you guys get all this,” Terrence said drolly, sweeping his upturned palm from his chest down past his waist, showing off the goods like a game show host. Jenna laughed and told him to fuck off and that’s when I realized they knew each other better than I’d thought. Possibly a lot better.

“Have you guys slept together?” I blurted. 

“Well, yeah,” Terrence said, serious now. 

“It was just a couple times,” Jenna said, glancing at him.

“Oh my God.” 

I felt like such an idiot. How had I not thought of this? How could we live as equals in Terrence if they’d already fucked? Was I going to be a permanent third wheel, hitched to their wagon as they engaged in some endless, uncontrollable inner fantasy?

“It really doesn’t matter,” Jenna said, putting her hand on my arm.

“Sarah, I thought we’d talked this through,” Terrence said softly. “We’re all sacrificing something here to make this happen. Right?”

“You know the situation. We can’t afford to exist in this city. Can’t afford to get old. But we’ve got each other, we’ve had our fun”—here he gestured to Jenna, and she rolled her eyes—“and now we can start thinking seriously about the rest of our lives. In a sustainable way.”

It was hard to argue with his logic, the brute logic of the market. In truth it wasn’t Terrence, or Jenna, or me making this decision; it had been made for us. Terrence gently put an arm around each of us.

“It’ll be okay, you guys,” he said, and he sounded like he really meant it. “Honestly, I think it’ll be fun.”

----------------------------------------

 

We lay flat in our sheaths, the three of us extending outward from the core of the rehoming machine, equidistant from one another, petals in an ivory-white lily of steel and glass. Above us, a giant monitor showing our vital signs was angled alongside the lighting rig, brighter than anything I’d ever seen. There was no one else in the room. An older man’s voice, warm and comforting, echoed over an intercom.“Everyone comfortable?”Jenna and I said yes. But when Terrence spoke his voice was weighted with an eerie profundity I’d never heard before, as if he was looking into the face of God, or meeting death.“I’m ready,” he said.

“Good. The masks will descend soon. When they attach, you’ll feel cold at first, then you’ll be asleep and the procedure will begin.”

I tried to capture the memory of my last moments of being an individual—a person, myself—but I was too anxious to think straight. My eyes kept turning to the screen with our vitals and I’d forget what I was thinking about. But I do remember thinking, I wish I’d been born rich.

> Who is that?
> 
> It’s me! Jenna.
> 
> I can’t see you.
> 
> I can’t see you either. But I can feel you.
> 
> God, it’s so dark. Where’s Terrence?
> 
> I don’t know. I haven’t seen him yet. Or, you know, sensed him.
> 
> This is really weird. I’m scared, Jenna.
> 
> Me too. Don’t worry. The doctor said it’ll get easier.
> 
> I feel like I’m freaking out. I need to get out of here!
> 
> But where can you go, Sarah? There’s no way out. We’re here now. Together.
> 
> Can you see what I’m thinking right now?
> 
> Oh no. I can feel it. Sarah, don’t.
> 
> This was a mistake.
> 
> Don’t, Sarah!

A flash of bright light and blurry colors, objects, and now I can see I’m—we’re—in a grocery store, a box of Cheerios is in front of me, of us, and our hand reaching for it and—

Terrence/Jenna/Sarah dropped the Cheerios and sank to the ground, one heavy knee crushing the box as their hands gripped their grimacing face. An elderly woman nearby gasped at the sight of their face contorted in pain, sweat glistening under the fluorescent glare.

They began shouting in a strained, demented voice:

> Sarah, what are you doing?
> 
> I know where I am.
> 
> SARAH. I don’t know what you’re doing but
> 
> Shut up! Both of you shut the fuck up.
> 
> Sarah don’t you’re going to hurt all of us not just you

On their feet and shoving past a thin and bespectacled middle-aged manager asking Are you all right evidently not understanding there’s no you anymore who could possibly consider this proposition. Now they’re running, floppily, not in full control because three people can’t drive a car and dodging a magazine rack and they attempt a jump as if none of them had never done such a thing before and 

> what am I doing, what are we

Terrence/Jenna/Sarah crashed through the window onto Peel street, their body crumpling onto the pavement in a din and cloud of shattered glass. Pedestrians scattered and when Terrence/Jenna/Sarah stood they gripped a hunk of glass like a dagger and blood was already flowing.

> I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I’M DOING
> 
> There’s no YOU anymore Sarah! Stop it now before you

Dr. Crane’s screen was shimmering with columns of cells and fields and small equations that measured and evaluated various risks. The column marked OUTCOMES mostly tilted toward an unsavory red with a few green and yellow spots, but all had agreed, these were early days. In any business the perfect is the enemy of the good, and the board had supported management’s decision to roll out the service and tweak as bugs were discovered.

The doctor carefully tapped in a brief summary of the case of Terrence Dunlop.

Process was successful but inhabitants displayed previously unknown signs of mental illness, she wrote, stopping to take a sip of her iced tea. All client homes have been reassigned to third-party recycling. Case closed. 

As she exited the form the column shifted from a brooding red to a pleasant lime green. The doctor’s calendar chimed: a slot for a new appointment opened up.
