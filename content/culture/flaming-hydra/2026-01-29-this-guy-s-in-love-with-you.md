What I Can’t Unsee

by Tal Lavin [https://flaminghydra.com/r/1c4f9a49?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

There’s a common technique in films and storytelling I call the Obligatory Heterosexual Interlude. It involves introducing a female character into a story, often one about passionate man-on-man action—whether that means admiration, hatred, spycraft, conspiracy or camaraderie—and having her kiss one of the main guys and then more or less vanish. She’s never someone of particular interest or power, never a contender for main character status; her personality, if present at all, is wan. She is there to kiss and evaporate, thereby dispersing the mists of gay passion that might otherwise have gathered and precipitated into action. She is plausible deniability in human form, with all the magnetism that implies.

Feminist critics have long been in open scorn of this formula, which, at its worst, is known as “fridging,” a term for the fate of a female character introduced only to evoke heterosexuality, and then vengeance, by dying.  The writer Gail Simone coined it in 1999, after an unfortunate Green Lantern comic in which the titular hero returns to find his girlfriend murdered and stuffed in a fridge by a villain named Major Force. The Women in Refrigerators [https://flaminghydra.com/r/a9b859dc?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] website catalogued the similarly gruesome fates of scores of women in comics. In movies, sometimes the dead woman emerges from her fridge to produce a soft-focus domestic memory, inevitably juxtaposed against the grittiness of the hero’s current quest for vengeance. Otherwise, she remains silent in her little icebox.

Since I came out as trans [https://flaminghydra.com/r/ce1edcaa?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], I started noticing all sorts of gay stuff about the media I watch and read. It’s not something I consciously do, just an extra sense I’ve developed, more keenly since I’ve started identifying as part of the gay community. Noticing gay stuff includes noticing homoerotic subtext, whether consciously placed there by the filmmakers or not. It also includes noticing efforts to mitigate even the subtlest breath of gayness.

Fridging its its own evil—a silencing, a permission structure for violence—but a different aspect of the Obligatory Heterosexual Interlude I’ve started noticing, and have subsequently been seeing everywhere, is a bit subtler. It first slapped me in the face in the middle of a random HBO selection, watching the nearly forgotten 2003 film And Starring Pancho Villa As Himself. It’s about a real-life lost film of 1914 that chronicled the socialist revolutionary Pancho Villa’s war for Mexico. The Hollywood reprise of its past myths features gorgeous and criminally obscure Eion Bailey (imagine Henry Cavill as you first saw him) as filmmaker Frank Thayer, Antonio Banderas as Pancho Villa (which you can tell because almost every sentence he utters is a reference to himself, as Pancho Villa, in third person). Other figures orbit around this central pair, including Alan Arkin as a Bronx Jewish socialist revolutionary machine-gunner-cum-translator, yanking gold teeth out of the skulls of dead federales, and Matt Day as John Reed, the real-life socialist author of the definitive Russian Revolution diary, Ten Days That Shook the World. 

Antonio Banderas, Matt Day, Carl Dillard, and Eion Bailey in And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself [https://flaminghydra.com/r/7742769e?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] (2003)

But the real engine of the film is the young, handsome Thayer’s unabashed and passionate admiration for the revolutionary. What is plainly happening onscreen is a young, sheltered, blue-eyed naif falling passionately for a socialist revolution and the uber-masculine ideal embodied in its chief. Thayer’s love for Villa is so palpable in every line of adoring dialogue, in every besotted look he casts towards Villa as he is slashing throats with his saber or humiliating a lecherous priest, that the most perfunctory of Obligatory Heterosexual Interludes is introduced almost as if to offer a preemptive sop to homophobic censors.

Eion Bailey and Alexa Davalos in And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself [https://flaminghydra.com/r/5df09d87?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] (2003)

The woman introduced for this heterosexual interlude is, of course, gorgeous; Alexa Davalos is devastating in 1910s costume, both in her first brief introduction on a film set and her later (preposterous) arrival in Mexico as Villa’s sister, in a scripted narrative introduced by the studio. She kisses Frank Thayer, and the kiss is less of the desperate-thirst kind than the gentle peck of the woman who knows she’s a beard from the start. Their romance is truncated, and barely rates inclusion in the story. Her character as a Hollywood actress in revolutionary Mexico might have had a few interesting encounters, but the role is shortchanged; her presence is merely an open and blatant salvo against the notion that a handsome man watching Antonio Banderas on horseback might develop erotic feelings about him. Given that it’s nearly impossible not to do that, this is the most obvious of Obligatory Heterosexual Interludes I’ve ever seen in my life. And since brushing against it in this obscure film, I haven’t been able to stop noticing them since.

Robert Redford [https://flaminghydra.com/r/2fabd060?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] and Faye Dunaway [https://flaminghydra.com/r/00a6a079?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] in Three Days of the Condor (1975) [https://flaminghydra.com/r/08c1cff6?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

They crop up everywhere, from the genuinely weird antics of Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway in the otherwise fabulous ’70s-chic Three Days of the Condor (although Dunaway does notably refer to herself as “The Ol’ Spy-fucker”) to the banality of Marvel’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier, an extremely and passionately gay film, aside from the Captain’s unlikely interest in his duplicitous blonde neighbor Sharon Carter. (She literally has him under surveillance, presumably in case he becomes too gay.)*

In Slow Horses, the hapless and lovely spy Sidonie Baker is introduced and shot in quick succession, lest our young main character’s fascination with his older boss be construed as anything but a hunt for an unlikely mentor. And so on, and so on; this is just a random selection of movies and shows I’ve seen lately, not the worst or most notable offenders. It’s a plague.

I say this because the Obligatory Heterosexual Interlude offends on multiple levels. It mutilates the story by adding an extraneous limb, a prehensile tale if you will. It swindles the actress obliged to embody Heterosexuality Itself by giving her little more to do than smile winningly and exchange the obligatory kiss and caress. It stifles the relationship between the main characters, by making certain that adoration, or enmity, or friendship, cannot contain homoerotic undercurrents that might develop into homosexual currents. It shortchanges our imaginations, by crushing them onto a Procrustean bed in which everyone is straight and a woman is a kind of vestigial limb, an empty symbol of straightness, an addendum to a powerful man.

----------------------------------------

 

It’s 2026, and the world is getting aggressively, cruelly more conformist, which also means straighter. Queer people are being driven into narrower and narrower straits. Obligatory heterosexuality is everywhere; those who dare to defy it are discarded in life and mocked in death. We should demand better for our stories. Let the young filmmaker fall in love with Antonio Banderas with his sword on his horse; let the Captain and Bucky Barnes finally fall into each other’s arms, and see what funky stuff a metal cyborg arm can add to bedroom activities. Let subtext become buttsex. We owe it to ourselves to kill the Obligatory Heterosexual Interlude in our heads, and we need stories brave enough to do that for us. In doing so we will find ourselves in a queerer and freer world.

*It’s worth noting that the book series that would contain Heated Rivalry, the much-feted gay hockey butt sluts show, actually started its life as Captain America/Winter Soldier fanfic [https://flaminghydra.com/r/48b11cf9?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], in an alternate universe in which Bucky Barnes worked at a smoothie shop and Steve Rogers was captain of a hockey team. That’s how gay that movie is!
