New York, Forever Lost and Found

by Anna Merlan [https://flaminghydra.com/r/a91d3804?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

When I first moved to New York in 2009, the very first night I lay down to sleep in a coffin-narrow room in Harlem, I had a maddening sense of wonderful things happening just out of my reach: all the parties I didn’t know about yet, the restaurants I hadn’t found, the bookstores, all the friends and enemies and secret places I knew were waiting for me. I found them—some of them, anyway; but New York’s appeal always remained, in part, the sense of how many alternate realities might still be at hand, if I only went up the right staircase, walked down the right street at the right time, or had the right chance encounter. 

I’ve been away for years, and am now an outsider again who comes to town occasionally and marvels at what’s there now, what’s gone, my vanished youth, and how many places have become a Capital One Café. But that sense of another, more mysterious, tantalizing New York existing nearby on a different plane is still with me. I glimpsed it again recently when, in an English-language bookstore in Tokyo, I picked up a very old copy of the The New York City Guide [https://flaminghydra.com/r/6cc63216?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], published in 1939 by the Federal Writers Project [https://flaminghydra.com/r/f460e305?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], a branch of the Works Progress Administration. A New Deal-era program, the FWP hired out-of-work writers to produce guides to the 48 existing American states and Alaska. The project was part of an even larger entity, Federal Project One, which created jobs for out-of-work artists, including musicians, actors and artists.

For years, the identities of the FWP writers weren’t widely known; then as now, writers tended to keep their money troubles to themselves. But researchers eventually learned that the ranks of the FWP included many famous names, among them Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, Saul Bellow, and Studs Terkel. An absorbing report [https://flaminghydra.com/r/892f1871?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] in the New York Times relates that some participants found the work to be humbling, if not outright humiliating; John Cheever, for instance, was an editorial assistant in the FWP, a task he apparently hated and predictably found to be beneath him, reportedly describing his job [https://flaminghydra.com/r/cccafb05?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] as fixing “the sentences written by some incredibly lazy bastards.”

Even if one didn’t know about the book’s sophisticated authors—who go unnamed in its pages—The New York City Guide is beautiful: a richly detailed, often melancholy, finely-tuned depiction, hundreds of pages long, of the city at one epoch of its history. An introduction to Manhattan reads, in part: “In the city, night workers, their footsteps sharp, irregular on the quiet streets, return home. A water wagon rolls by. Bands are still playing in half a  dozen night clubs. In the Upper East Side, in the Upper West Side, in the Gashouse and Hell’s Kitchen, in Chelsea and Greenwich Village, the faint and broken ringing of alarm clocks comes to the empty street.” One theme of these guidebooks is a quiet but pointed observation and celebration of the diversity of America (to use a phrase that has since, alas, acquired a taint of poison, we might even say it makes America great).

New York City Guide [https://flaminghydra.com/r/1fb8139d?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], 1939

“Here is the greatest city of the Jews,” reads another part of the Manhattan section, just a few pages later. “Here, all unconscious of exoticism, thousands of persons celebrate bar mitzvah, sit shiva for their dead. Streets littered with papers, bags of garbage shooting out of windows, lines of pushcarts selling food, neckties, pictures, bric-a-brac.” Not everything in the guide is flattering, or meant to be. “It is anomalous that Brooklyn, the borough of homes and churches,” one section reads, “should have some of the worst slums (Williamsburg, Brownsville, Red Hook) of the nation, yet such is the case.”   

Reading the guidebook now gives the sense, not of a past city, but a parallel one, an unseen but strangely familiar river flowing just over the horizon. There, Sunset Park is a Finnish and Scandinavian neighborhood, filled with “Finnish steam baths,” local food, and societies where the homeland culture is kept alive: “Folk dances are held occasionally, where the women wear the gay peasant costumes of their native land.” Rikers Island is described as a miracle of modern social science, a “model penitentiary” with a sixty-acre farm, a pork-processing facility, and a “fully equipped hospital with the largest venereal disease clinic in the city." The prison management, we are assured, “uses a scientific classification system for determining the needs and attributes of each prisoner in preparation for the prison’s unusual educational, vocational and recreational program.”

Even then, there was a sense of elegy in the guide’s pages for an earlier New York that in its turn had vanished. The Flatiron Building, “whose very name has to be explained to a younger generation,” one section dryly noted, “is the only tangible evidence that there was ever a Madison Square–a glamorous Madison Square. Here, Ward McAllister’s ‘Four Hundred [https://flaminghydra.com/r/837f3d95?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]’ dined and danced at Delmonico’s, and the old aristocracy, including the Roosevelts, lived in brownstone mansions following a pattern of life preserved only in the pages of novels about ‘little old New York.’” 

Around 1939, the year the New York City guide was published, the Federal Writers Project and other elements of the Works Progress Administration were strangled out of existence by the House Un-American Activities Committee, with committee member J. Parnell Thomas denouncing the programs as a “hotbed of Communists [https://flaminghydra.com/r/67b537f4?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122].” Then as now, the burden of supporting the arts shifted to the states; the FWP continued as a state-funded project until 1943. 

Much has changed since the 1930s, but talented writers and artists are still broke and out of work. In 2021, responding to the Covid pandemic, two members of Congress from California and New Mexico proposed a 21st century version [https://flaminghydra.com/r/e9a899df?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] of the Federal Writers Project; fittingly for the much drearier times in which we live today, the proposal died in committee.

Two Videos

Instagram [https://flaminghydra.com/r/0cc45c87?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

The clip is 23 seconds long [https://flaminghydra.com/r/a5f0d7bd?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. It opens with some deliberately grainy footage of erstwhile Venezuelan President Nicolàs Maduro giving a furious speech; the subtitles (which rattle and jitter across the bottom of the screen in English) translate his words as, “Come and get me! / I'll wait here in Miraflores / Don't wait too long / Coward!” The video then cuts to Secretary of State Marco Rubio who, in a speech of his own, says the words, “now if you don’t know, now you know,” words popularized in the 1994 song “Juicy” by The Notorious B.I.G.

https://flaminghydra.com/r/471caae5?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122via Instagram [https://flaminghydra.com/r/fcca7cbe?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

Next, we see a still photograph of Maduro, now in handcuffs, earmuffs, and a dark visor, apparently captive in what looks like an aircraft cabin. Finally, briefly, Donald Trump strolls triumphantly in slow motion down a White House hallway. The score is “Hypnotize,” also by The Notorious B.I.G. The video was posted less than three hours after the military operation to kidnap and depose Maduro had taken place on January 3.

Another video appeared online four days later, and it is very different. It is approximately the same length as the White House video, but there are no quick cuts, no subtitles, and no musical score. It shows two ICE agents approaching a car in a residential Minneapolis neighborhood, while a third agent, standing in front of the vehicle, draws a gun. An unseen voice shouts, “No!”

The third officer fires his gun toward the car multiple times before it comes to a stop, while the unseen voice continues to shout: “Shit! Shit!...What the fuck did you do?” The video supplies no additional explanation or context for what we are seeing, but by the end of the day on January 7, it was known throughout the United States and the world that it is a record of the murder of Renee Nicole Good.

https://flaminghydra.com/r/0c377dc4?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122Screencap via YouTube [https://flaminghydra.com/r/9c7e6eae?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

The gulf between these two films says a great deal about who we are and how we think as a country right now. The White House’s Maduro video was the end product of an unfathomable amount of careful preparation—not only of the video (which, given the timeline, must have involved keeping a media team on standby and ready to publish within minutes of the operation’s conclusion), but of the kidnapping itself, which must have been planned over weeks or months. It would be misunderstanding the situation to imagine that the video was a promotion or celebration of a successful military accomplishment: one might say instead that the military objective was to provide the necessary raw footage to produce and post this video. 

----------------------------------------

 

Trump himself fueled speculation that the purpose of the Venezuela operation was to extract oil wealth [https://flaminghydra.com/r/25ab94d7?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], or to provide a pretext for deportation efforts [https://flaminghydra.com/r/e7b1c12e?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] in the U.S., and while these are certainly welcome side benefits for the Trump regime, they were far from the point, which always has been and always will be to stoke his content-creation presidency. If observable reality does not yet provide the material necessary to post the video, reality must be altered accordingly. The presidency and the U.S. armed forces are merely very effective means to this end.

The surprising thing, to me at least, is how poorly the White House propaganda performed at the box office, or polls. Weeks of planning; a surprise military operation that required precise timing and delicate exchanges of real-time intelligence; at least 80 people killed on the ground in Caracas; an actual sitting head of state, kidnapped for the cameras—after all this, opinion polls revealed that American approval for the Venezuela operation sat at approximately 33% [https://flaminghydra.com/r/c372e1d6?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. 

----------------------------------------

 

This is not how things were supposed to be. Four decades ago, in media scholar Neil Postman’s book Amusing Ourselves to Death, Postman contended that the ubiquity of television had fundamentally recontextualized the way Americans understood the world around them. The thrust of his argument is that beginning with the telegraph and climaxing with the television, American society was transformed from one based on words to one based on images, with the result that information became progressively disconnected: it existed only as discrete, independent items of “news,” to be consumed and discarded without regard for any larger context:

> News took the form of slogans, to be noted with excitement, to be forgotten with dispatch. Its language was also entirely discontinuous. One message had no connection to that which preceded or followed it. Each “headline” stood alone as its own context. The receiver of the news had to provide a meaning if he could. The sender was under no obligation to do so. And because of all this, the world as depicted by the telegraph began to appear unmanageable, even undecipherable… “Knowing” the facts took on a new meaning, for it did not imply that one understood implications, background, or connections. 

The inventor of the modern commercial as we know it was Rosser Reeves, the head of the Ted Bates Agency in the early 1950’s. Reeves in his day was considered both a menace and a visionary. His ads for Anacin pain reliever [https://flaminghydra.com/r/9771a7c5?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] were considered so famously, universally annoying that they managed to triple the product’s sales over an 18-month period. 

It was inevitable that this new medium would find its first true expression in the form of the 15-second commercial, and the commercial, in turn, would reach its apotheosis in the political TV spot. 

In 1952, to the horror of political pundits, Reeves was hired by the Dwight D. Eisenhower campaign to design what would be the very first political campaign ads in 20th century history. Reeve’s spots for Eisenhower [https://flaminghydra.com/r/d79d65b6?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] were ridiculously tame by modern standards: a series of stiff 15-second Q&A exchanges in which an interlocutor asks Ike a question on some key topic, and he warbles a punchy response. But at the time, it was received (and in retrospect, not without cause) as the first great blow against reasoned political discourse. How could the public be expected to make sense of major issues posed and resolved in a 15-second sound bite? How could this show us anything worth knowing about Eisenhower’s politics at all?

Reeves’s response to newspaper editor Harlan Cleveland, as quoted by David Halberstam in his book The Fifties, was blithely dismissive: 

> “Do you remember the speech that Churchill gave at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri? What did he say there?” “That an Iron Curtain had descended on Europe,” Cleveland said. What else did he say? Reeves pushed. Cleveland could not remember. 
> 
> “That was a fifteen-second spot from Churchill,” Reeves said, “just like the one during the war about ‘never have so many owed so much to so few.’ That was a Churchill spot, too. He was very good at spots.” [...]
> 
> “This can lead to demagoguery,” Cleveland said. “An uninformed electorate can lead to demagoguery faster,” Reeves said, confident that what he was doing was helping to inform the electorate.

 

[https://flaminghydra.com/r/340a649a?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

In 1986, less than a year after the publication of Amusing Ourselves to Death, Donald Trump aired his first TV spot: an ad for the Trump Castle Casino in Atlantic City. With a quick-cutting barrage of scantily-clad women and flashing signs reading “FREE INDOOR PARKING,” it bathed viewers in a context-free aura of gaudy luxury.

Sandi Bachom, one of the designers of that casino ad, posted about it just this past week on X [https://flaminghydra.com/r/0210267d?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]:

I realize this is a far from novel revelation, but Trump’s presidency represents the inevitable end point of the decontextualization of politics: pure mass theater wholly unrelated to the world it affects, right up until the moment the effects become impossible to deny. For most American civilians that moment hasn’t yet come, but it will soon enough.

As I write, the U.S. seems to be sliding toward a war, cold or hot, with Western Europe, though few if any members of the public want, support, or are even fully aware of it yet. In the face of furious and mounting anger and appalling polls, Trump started not only a foreign war but a domestic one as well, against his own people in Minnesota. The whole of our political conversation has come to feel like an endless, hallucinatory fever dream that no longer bears the faintest resemblance to anything you or I have ever seen in the course of our daily lives. Because our political discourse has become the opposite of life: an alternative to it, in which every moment exists entirely for itself.

----------------------------------------

 

This is why, I suspect, the death of Renee Nicole Good disrupted and transcended the administration’s mass hallucination. Despite its brevity and intensity, the video of Good’s murder was emphatically not a Rosser Reeves production, not staged, not “persuasive,” not slick or manufactured.

By confronting us with its existence, the video forced us, against our inclinations, to see that there was a context behind it, and that this context was a human life. Renee Nicole Good existed before that video, and she ceased to exist after it—a real member of our real, actual world from whom, in the end, we could not turn away.
