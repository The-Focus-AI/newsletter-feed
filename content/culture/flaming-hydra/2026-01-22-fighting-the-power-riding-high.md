Lessons from Minneapolis

by Myriam Gurba [https://flaminghydra.com/r/2b403b87?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

Christina Nicholson was walking her dog Zinnia in Minneapolis’s Powderhorn neighborhood when two police cars raced past her. 

“Oh!” she thought. “That’s not good.” 

When Nicholson got home, she headed to her office to work. Within minutes, her wife knocked at the door and made a grim announcement.  

“They killed somebody.” 

The police cars that Nicholson had seen were responding to the shooting of legal observer Renee Macklin Good. Nicholson and her wife live just six blocks from the site where a federal agent killed their comrade in front of her wife, Becca Good. The couple also lives six blocks from George Floyd Square, the site where police officer Derek Chauvin lynched Floyd in 2020.

Nicholson exhales in a deep sigh.

“It’s been a long five years.”

Nicholson is one of two queer activists who spoke with me by phone about their work defending Minneapolis from two occupying forces, the Minneapolis Police Department and ICE. The other is Anika, a non-binary activist who also lives in the Powderhorn neighborhood. They too were working from home on the day of Good’s killing. After receiving a Facebook notification that a shooting had just happened on Portland Avenue, Anika went out to investigate. They found their nearby intersection blocked by MPD. ICE surrounded the area. 

“It was crazy,” Anika says. “I had just read about it online and then I stepped out my front door and there it was.”

Both Anika and Nicholson moved to Minnesota from other states. Anika hails from New England and has lived in Minneapolis for three years. They’ve heard colleagues and comrades mention that the current moment feels like déjà vu—that it seems like the police learned nothing from the uprisings that took place after the murder of George Floyd.  While the latest killing has compounded the trauma citywide, Anika emphasizes that Minneapolis’s tight-knit community shows up for each other; because the MPD can’t be trusted, the community has learned how to take responsibility for its own care. 

Nicholson agrees. Raised in nearby Missouri, she has lived in Minneapolis since 1999. She credits her community’s powerful resistance to ICE to the reckoning triggered by the Floyd lynching. When the community rose up to demand justice, residents also established networks of mutual aid, deliberately bypassing city institutions, and providing direct services to residents instead. 

“I don’t think those fuckers were ready for all of this and how quickly we mobilized,” Nicholson says of the occupation. 

She takes pride in Minneapolis’s strengths. Rather than promoting the melting-pot cliché, the people of Minneapolis protect diversity and practice cultural exchange. Instead of encouraging residents to blend into a bland oneness, neighbors embrace and defend difference.

Much of Nicholson’s activism happens through her involvement with the First Universalist Church, a Unitarian Universalist institution. The church is preparing for ICE Out, a general strike scheduled for tomorrow, January 23. 

“People are generally feeling solid about the strike,” she says. “It’s going to be oppressively cold, but I think that even with the actual temperature of seventeen below, people will turn out. There are over one hundred faith leaders here from all over the country and I anticipate we’ll have a lot of folx in the streets.” Nicholson also monitors her own block and has visited her neighbors to drop off whistles to blow if ICE appears. She understands the importance of meeting the people in our neighborhoods. Nicholson says, “We know each other. And we know who the fuck is down to ride right down to the house.” After Good was killed, Nicholson received video footage of the shooting from a friend who filmed the event. She posted the video to social media. 

“I didn’t do it to sensationalize it. I did it because I felt like this was going to be erased. Women’s versions of events get changed, and I wanted people to know the truth,” Nicholson said.

Their neighborhood has been especially hard hit by ICE, Anika tells me. They decided to confront the occupation by joining street patrols and a rapid response network. Raids can happen so fast that by the time Anika responds to a call, sometimes entire families have already been abducted. Anika also monitors and documents vehicles at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, an ICE staging center and detention site. While many residents haven’t yet recovered from the events of 2020, Anika says, the people of Minneapolis learned from those experiences and are using them in the current fight. In their neighborhood, everyone leans into their differences, and they organize around those. Anika urges anyone who wants to replicate the methods being practiced in Minneapolis to talk to their neighbors. That’s how organizing starts.

When I ask Nicholson why she came to Minneapolis, she says that she came for the gayness and stayed for the community. About the chaos and violence sown by the state, she says, “I always think of that saying, that flowers grow in shit.” 

Nicholson believes that ICE is occupying Minneapolis with such ferocity because of the mutual aid and community care networks that emerged in the wake of the Floyd lynching. She says that Minneapolis is being punished for using the criminal legal system to try, convict, and incarcerate Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd. Nicholson volunteered with Nonviolent Peace Force during the Chauvin trial; she wanted to be part of the efforts that put him in prison. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison secured the conviction of Chauvin [https://flaminghydra.com/r/bbbb4312?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. Minneapolis residents have been speculating for months that Trump may try to get Chauvin out. If he does, Nicholson says, they’re prepared to fight.

After Good’s murder, Minneapolis public schools closed for several days. Nicholson’s voice quavers when she mentions the need for school patrols to protect kids from ICE. While they’ve since reopened, many have switched to remote learning. Some parents are too terrified even to let their children outdoors, but staying home endangers them, too. According to an internal ICE memo obtained by the Associated Press, federal immigration officers are asserting the power to forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant [https://flaminghydra.com/r/82dd0079?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. 

Meanwhile, the Pentagon has prepared 1,500 active-duty soldiers to invade Minneapolis. Writing for The Guardian, legal scholar Claire Finkelstein warns that events in Minneapolis may escalate into civil war [https://flaminghydra.com/r/db5e5d90?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. In light of that warning, there’s no better time than now to begin getting to know your neighbors.

Viva la bicicleta alta

by Tod Seelie [https://flaminghydra.com/r/24f7ce96?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

Félix Ramón Guirola Cepero is the only tall bike builder in Cuba. I met him while on assignment in Cuba when I noticed a tall bike (meaning, a rideable bike built from two or more stacked bicycle frames) outside a building in Havana, and inquired about its creator. 

Over subsequent trips in 2015, 2016, and 2017, I spent time with Félix riding around Havana, accompanying him to source his parts and visiting a cockfighting ring. He’s boisterous, outspoken, and full of energy. To hang out with Félix is to jump into a whirlwind of vitality and motion, weaving through traffic. He only stops when he has to, casually leaning on a public bus at an intersection. 

Félix has been exceptionally resourceful in building his bikes in Cuba, a very poor country that has been suffering under a U.S. trade embargo since 1962. He uses ancient Chinese frames, rebar, and he makes pedals from sections of cut PVC pipe. When he is not working on his bikes Félix and his wife Franci sell candy, snacks, and cooking oil out of their living room.

I eventually collaborated with Anna Merlan on a profile of Félix for BBC Travel [https://flaminghydra.com/r/65551743?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. During that visit he told us that his one goal was to hold the world record for the tallest bicycle. I happened to be friends with the world record holder at the time, Richie Trimble [https://flaminghydra.com/r/536651ef?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], so I set about orchestrating getting Richie to Havana.

A subsequent trip followed, I introduced Richie to Félix, and they set to work devising a way to top Richie’s impressive record of 6.15 meters. I could only stay for a limited time, so I wasn’t present when they made their official attempt in Havana. Unfortunately, they were ultimately unsuccessful; though their bike met the height requirements, a fault in the steering mechanism prevented them from riding it for the required length of time.

Undaunted, Félix is still riding his tall bikes around Havana and building a house outside the city with lots of room for his roosters. He had been trying to come to the U.S. to work on a tall bike project here, but with the current climate, he understands that it is very unlikely for the time being.
