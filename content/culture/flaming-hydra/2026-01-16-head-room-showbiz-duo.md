Truth or Consequences

by Jídé Salawu

In an interview for an adjunct professor position last summer, I was asked how I have been treating students who write with AI or bots in my class. Though I prepared for the interview for days I confess I did not take that question seriously in my preparation, because so far, I have not seen a case I could flag for such a misdemeanor. There would be little sense in enrolling in a class dedicated to original thought, making claims based on narratives and texts, and substantiating them with evidence from those texts, if we mean to respond to those requirements merely by asking ChatGPT to “write” for us—that is, to mash together ideas generated by others into a rough semblance of meanings not our own.

A better question to ask is, how do we approach increasingly urgent questions of integrity and credibility? 

For more than a year now I have taught at the University of Alberta, where we now have AI policies in place; teachers are adding their personal statements on AI usage to their pages and syllabi. Last fall I taught a course dedicated to the Black geographies of Afro-Canadian migrants and subjects. We read Dionne Brand, Austin Clarke, and the filmmaker Shelagh Mackenzie, who worked on the 1991 documentary Remember Africville [https://flaminghydra.com/r/8baf63c3?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. I found I needed to dissuade my students from using AI to generate scholarly sources due to the risk of errors. 

I learnt at the feet of the old folks, whose idea of intellectual labour and dignity is rooted in the originality and energy put into an idea. There may be some romantic bias in this view, which leads ineluctably to the conviction that using a machine as an aid in thinking is like a shortcut—or a cheat, if you want to call it that. But AI is here with us now, and we must grapple with its immediate and far-reaching implications in a serious way. Whether or not you support traditional forms of study doesn’t change how the world’s progress and the steady growth of human society must rely on our authentic thoughts and innovations, shaking up the meanings inherent in earlier narratives, images, and policies.

I defended my students in the interview, but I also flunked it because I hadn’t given enough thought to the disruption—the pedagogical revolution, really—represented by AI in the classroom. If I am to survive as a teacher and writer, I must now see these innovations as a part of my world. Already we live in an epoch brimming with machine-manufactured narratives; as we speak, robotic works of AI fiction, drama, film, and even poetry are flooding into the global commons. 

Since the introduction of ChatGPT just three years ago, I’ve been asking myself what this techification of writing would really mean for critics, poets, and novelists—people whose livelihoods depend on authenticity, creativity, and uniqueness. We’ve seen that those who do not have formal entry into the trade of writing or literature can now cosplay as writers; their “work” looks roughly like the real thing, provided you don’t look too closely; on examination, however—so far, at least—literary works produced by AI have all been banal and derivative. Even so, the rapid spread of large language models like ChatGPT has by now spooked STEM professionals [https://flaminghydra.com/r/730a6c39?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] as well as long-suffering humanists. 

What I sense coming, on social media as well as in conversation with colleagues, is a growing hunger for human-produced ideas, readings, and arts. 

----------------------------------------

 

Certain words are now taken as signals that a given piece of writing may have been generated by an LLM [https://flaminghydra.com/r/c9d51da1?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. Last summer a group of international researchers claimed to have found a sudden increase [https://flaminghydra.com/r/4ded41ac?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] in the use of  “delve,” “underscore” “showcasing,” and other uncommon words, as well as the frequent use of em dashes, in machine-generated prose. By that reckoning the 19th century poet Emily Dickinson, famously a lover of em dashes, might easily have been accused of generating her work on ChatGPT.

Em dashes are beautiful; they are the pillar of emphasis in writing. They help put the crown on your phrases. But as Hajra Ghuman says that the em dash is accused, not of bad grammar, but of being an “AI tell,” with the result that “some professors and editors now treat this punctuation choice as forbidden fruit, a stylistic red flag suggesting your work might not be fully human.” I do not think this should be the case. There is no basis for it. It is only pure academic paranoia about AI.

Ethan Mollick [https://flaminghydra.com/r/db283578?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], an associate professor at Wharton who studies “the effects of artificial intelligence on work, entrepreneurship, and education,” wrote in 2024 that  “the core irony of generative AIs like ChatGPT and Bing is that they were supposed to be all logic and no imagination. Instead, we get AIs that make up information, engage in (seemingly) emotional discussions and are intensely creative. And that last fact makes many people deeply uncomfortable.” 

For many, many people, however, large language models have failed to demonstrate [https://flaminghydra.com/r/d4607251?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] anything resembling a credible affective and emotional capacity. They have been loudly and repeatedly criticized for their lack of creativity, and the absence of the intricacies that human thought possesses. Again, I won’t be the first scholar to state that the language produced by AI is almost uniformly flat, tasteless, and boring. It is mainly the Silicon Valley tech executives, who are reaping enormous personal fortunes from the spread of genAI, who have sung the empty praises of genAI fiction. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, for example, claimed that the fiction generated by his company’s product, a short story called “A machine-shaped hand,” “got the vibe of metafiction so right [https://flaminghydra.com/r/b52507d7?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122].” What “the vibe of metafiction” might be, or mean, was left entirely to the reader’s imagination. That, too, was a tell.

----------------------------------------

 

Fifteen years ago I was still in Ife, nascent, navigating how to live a literary life. I began using the internet as an aid in studying classic authors as an undergraduate student of literature at Obafemi Awolowo University. I was introduced to the techniques of close reading by teachers who had learned them hands-on in the pre-internet era. Some of our lecturers, although aware of the revolutionary technologies that brought research and writing to Google, taught in classrooms where close reading was done in handwriting, on paper, and only term papers were required to be typed. Assignments and tests were written on foolscap sheets, and there was no machine where one might upload “A Rose for Emily” by William Faulkner or Chinua Achebe’s “Dead Men’s Path” in order to extract a tinned analysis. 

It appears that old world is not entirely gone. Instructors everywhere are returning to the old model of oral exams, or requiring work to be handwritten on paper. That is done to enable integrity.

----------------------------------------

 

In addition to grappling with the perceived inevitability of AI integration into every institution and system of learning, there is now a flood of apps on the internet, such as citation machines, purporting to help scholars. There have even been scholars submitting machine-generated papers [https://flaminghydra.com/r/dc3ae05b?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] as original contributions. Increasingly, these people are getting caught and suffering the consequences. 

Ultimately it rests with us to live in relation with large language models, and to decide what our lives amid these machines can accommodate or refuse. But let me echo the voice of my friend James Yeku, a professor of digital humanities and African studies at the University of Kansas: “To use it ethically is the key. Never to surrender human agency to it.”

Kent Goes to Chelmsford: Episode 1

by Jack Pendarvis [https://flaminghydra.com/r/9c8d81e6?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

Dan Tana’s [https://flaminghydra.com/r/e7aa509d?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]

Kent Osborne lives in Vermont. Jack Pendarvis lives in Mississippi. The two old friends, each sleep-deprived and noticeably loopy from traveling all day, met up at a hotel bar in Burbank, California, to discuss Kent’s role in the 1992 drama School Ties.

Episode 1: Jack Looks Great

JACK: Okay, so here we are. We’re both—Kent and I are kind of punchy. What time did you get up this morning?

KENT: Uh, 3 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

JACK: I got up at 4 a.m. Central Time.

KENT: And I only slept for an hour. So, really, I’ve been up since yesterday morning.

JACK: So this should be a great interview.

KENT: [Laughter.] I feel pretty good!

JACK: I feel all right, too. I’m just happy to see you. I think I’m invigorated. We had dinner at Dan Tana’s.

KENT: Yeah.

JACK: You’d never been there before.

KENT: That’s right. I just took a picture of you because there’s a monkey behind your head.

JACK: There’s always a monkey behind my head.

KENT: Yeah, uhm, I went to Dan Tana’s once to use the bathroom when I was driving Daniel Baldwin in a limousine. 

JACK: Welcome to Season 2 of my podcast.

KENT: [Laughter.]

JACK: I call it a podcast, but I type it rather than, uh…

KENT: When you type it do you add anything?

JACK: No! I love—I love transcribing. Weirdly, I love typing! And Season 1 was… oh!

KENT: Thank you!

JACK: Thank you so much.

HARVEY (the bartender): There you are.

JACK: We’re addressing Harvey, one of the world’s great bartenders.

HARVEY: Cheers. Good to see you, Jack. Welcome back.

JACK: It’s been a long time.

HARVEY: I know. You said seven years. I can’t believe it.

JACK: Yeah!

HARVEY: Time flies. You look great.

JACK: You look great!

HARVEY: Appreciate you. [Harvey walks away.]

KENT: [Laughter.] Wow.

JACK: Anyhow, so, now I’m just too fascinated by how great I look.

KENT: [Laughter.]

JACK: I can’t think of what we were talking about. Well, Season 1 was my friend Ace…

KENT: Right.

JACK: Who worked on the Pauly Shore movie Jury Duty. And I called it Ace Goes to Hollywood. This season’s going to be about you working on School Ties, the Brendan Fraser… am I saying that correctly?

KENT: I think so. Fraser. Fraser.

JACK: Because there’s no—it’s not like Kelsey Grammer. Frasier.

KENT: No, I think it’s… yeah. Fraser. [Laughter.]

JACK: This is gold! Anyway, so you worked on the movie School Ties. And so this season is going to be called Kent Goes to Chelmsford, because, apparently, that’s where it was filmed.

KENT: Well…

JACK: That’s where it was shot?

KENT: No. I would have to look it up, but that’s… the hotel we stayed at was Chelmsford. It was the Chelmsford Inn.

JACK: Was that the name of the town?

KENT: Yeah. And then there was Middlesex, a private school. And that’s where we filmed on location.

JACK: But that was just the name of the school.

KENT: And there were also some… some, like, sets. Uh… we shot in a, like, in a big soundstage.

JACK: Where was the soundstage?

KENT: It was all in this area outside of Boston. But I think the soundstage was… I don’t think it was on the grounds of the school. I think it was, like… you know—I don’t know if it was a soundstage or if they repurposed a warehouse, or…

JACK: This is the most boring podcast ever!

KENT: But it was the first time I was on a movie set.

JACK: Oh, that’s interesting!

KENT: You’re walking around a set, and, like, there’s a background that’s outside the window, but it’s just a background with lights.

JACK: You mean like a flat?

KENT: Yeah, yeah.

JACK: A painting! 

KENT: Yeah, of, like, trees and stuff. And I remember thinking, “Wow, this is…”

JACK: Like, like Mario Bava would have done! Or, you know what I mean. Like, old-school stuff.

KENT: Yeah!

JACK: So this is your first time… now, this is really what I want to get started with. Because I’m curious. We’ve known each other for more than thirty years. Do you realize that?

KENT: Yeah! We met in ’95? ’94?

JACK: ’94, maybe. And the thing is, that was just a couple of years after School Ties came out, but I don’t think I knew you had been in that.

KENT: Right.

JACK: And until now, I did not realize that was your first time on a film set. What I’m really interested in is where you were mentally at the time. Like, when you—I assume there was an audition. 

KENT: Yeah. I was living in New York. I was, like, twenty? Twenty or twenty-one. And my mom was involved with this—my mom lived in Times Square.

JACK: It’s always back to your mom.

KENT: Yeah.

JACK: But that’s for another…

KENT: [Laughter.]

JACK: That’s for another podcast!

KENT: She was part of this group, it was called the Actors Information Project. And they would have—it was a place where actors could network and they would have professionals come in and do, like, talks, and it—I’m not too sure what it was! Anyways, I went there, and there was a casting director who did a class. Her name was Pat McCorkle. I did a scene in the class and she liked it, and she called me in to audition for School Ties. Uh… and I auditioned for one of the main characters.

JACK: Which one?

KENT: It was the character who kills himself. Or tries to kill himself?

JACK: That’s Dead Poets Society.

KENT: No, no, it’s…

JACK: Did you think you were auditioning for Dead Poets Society, a movie that had come out years before? That was Robert Sean Leonard, by the way. And I hated that when it came out! Because I was like… that’s not a good lesson for the kids! Your dad wants you to go to military school, why don’t you dress up like Puck and kill yourself?

KENT: [Laughter.] That’s not the message!

JACK: It seemed to be the message. [Laughter.] Look. I gotta repeat again: we’re punchy.

KENT: Yeah.

Please join us next time, when Kent tries to blow Jack’s mind but it doesn’t work.
