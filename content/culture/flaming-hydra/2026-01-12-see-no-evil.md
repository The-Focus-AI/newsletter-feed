Get Off Twitter

by Ian Williams

Amid awful days of murder and bloodlust, the news broke last week that Twitter has a massive AI-generated child porn problem. But what drove me to distraction, strangely, was not primarily horror of the child porn itself. It was the point-blank refusal of the media and political classes to give Twitter up, delivered in contradictory, murky, and often false statements made by way of excusing themselves.

The worst excuse for not leaving Twitter (we are not going to bother to call it X) is a crude and poorly-reasoned argument for “free speech.” [https://flaminghydra.com/r/a942d69f?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] After Epstein, ample (and growing) evidence demonstrates that a lot of powerful people think of the sexual exploitation of children as a jape, a joke, a little secret handshake kept from the masses to signal to one another that each is like the other but not like us. It’s their free speech. To the extent that the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, 8chan turns out to have been taking its cues from the powerful all along.

What drew my eye the most, though, was the slew of official lies about the sentience of Grok, Elon Musk’s AI child porn engine. “Musk’s AI chatbot Grok apologizes,” read a headline at The Hill, despite the fact that Grok, which is not sentient (noting here that autocorrect prompted me to refer to Grok as “who” rather than “which”), can’t affirmatively do anything. When that didn’t provide a salve for their consciences, politicians, such as Irish Minister for Media Patrick O’Donovan, stated that the people who make child porn with Grok [https://flaminghydra.com/r/ca8b04c9?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] are the ones who should be held responsible, rather than Twitter. After that percolated a bit in unsatisfactory fashion, Musk’s team announced that Grok’s child-porn-generating capabilities would go behind a paywall [https://flaminghydra.com/r/4ee3a59a?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. As if that were a good, or even a bad, solution to the problem. Finally the paywall, too, was revealed as a fraud; it turned out that Grok is not really paywalled at all [https://flaminghydra.com/r/db861b2f?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122].

The Hill is not Vox is not The Guardian is not an Irish politician, obviously, and each has its own imperatives and stakes in a story like this one. But as the child porn and deepfakes and bikini pictures of the recently murdered Renee Good kept flowing, what emerged above all was a picture of crippling addiction. When it was a convenient excuse for staying on Twitter, Grok was sentient; when that excuse failed, it was sentient no longer. When the “people, not machines, are bad” excuse stopped working, the paywall became the excuse to stay; it’s worth noting too that most outlets just regurgitated the paywall reporting, with absolutely zero interrogation of the utility or otherwise of a paywall on child porn—with links to their various regurgitations all posted, as ever, on Twitter.

The connective tissue here is simply that the people who run the world cannot, will not, get off Twitter. 

Even if AI is now in everything, foisted upon us by people actively planning our mass murder, it is, at base, an internet technology, operating on the tech sector’s logic. You log into your LLM drug of choice, type a prompt, and it spits out drivel. But it’s all still designed to get you hooked, and we are all hooked. One more swipe, one more prompt, one more scroll, one more check for one more retweet. Don’t want to talk to someone in person, especially if they’re your constituents or readers? Make your pronouncements on social media.

Except it’s 2026, so maybe now you talk to a chatbot, because even the image of a person on Twitter is too much to bear. Sure, all this may help you on your way to some version of psychosis, and there is a slight chance you could die by suicide, or murder someone, but in exchange it will spare you the cost of real reflection. Maybe by 2030, when even AI is too much, the destruction of yourself or others will escalate; you might choose it anyway, so long as it feels like you’re communicating while avoiding the cold, hard fact that communicating means sitting with yourself as much as it does with someone else.

There’s no engagement on Twitter. Get rid of that excuse. If you’re on the left or center, nobody on Twitter comes to your work through that app. If you’re on the right, you’re driven to post at ever higher registers, lest you get pinned down as the wrong sort of right, until you’re posting child porn prompts. If you’re still on Twitter, you’re a mark and an asshole who evidently approves of child porn, that is, who doesn’t disapprove of it enough to exit the child porn factory.

Leave Twitter. Most of us are old enough to have left once-beloved online spaces again and again. I myself joined and left Twitter, LiveJournal, Mastodon, and at least six forums when they went bad. Just leave. None of this lasts forever. And wasn’t the only good promise of the internet—the only promise it kept, and that (still) flies in the face of power’s insistence on surveilling us at all times—that you could just pick up, reinvent yourself, be someone else?

There’s something dark, primordial, destructive about the online addiction that is driving so many of us to madness. All my priors have started to crumble a little; all I learned in life and school is a little bit correct, still, but not enough to satisfy me. I could (and have) spit out a Marxist analysis, a feminist one, a Freudian one, or some combination, and it wouldn’t capture the fullness of what’s happening. Something has broken in me because I see that all of it—AI, our collective addiction to this thing we call “the internet,” the economy, the child porn, oafs murdering people in the streets—is connected but I lack the language, the smarts, to articulate the connection, to make it coherent. I’m only making a start, like many others, and together we may find the language in time.

If we make it, of course. Older people seem more scared of this moment than they were during the Cold War, during the upheavals of the ’60s, during the many crises of the ’70s. The world feels poised on the precipice, about to topple over. We made it 100 years with the Bomb without annihilating the planet but it feels as though we may only make it through 15 years of Web 2.0. 

Male Fantasies by Klaus Theweleit (1977)

Not for nothing, I finally decided to read Klaus Theweleit’s Male Fantasies this week. Written in 1977 and long regarded as one of the most important studies of fascism, it’s been on my to-do list for years, but it wasn’t germane to my immediate work. So I just didn’t, but then Grok’s child porn and Minneapolis happened, and it seemed to be time.

Male Fantasies is a tough read, not because it’s difficult, but because it isn’t. Theweleit offers us a matter-of-fact, direct, clipped analysis of Freikorps literature from interwar Germany. The ugliness and hatred is in plain language, in each diary entry and shitty novel. And it’s also immediately recognizable. It’s here, now, 2026, probably always, but definitely now.

The introduction of this edition, written by the great, much missed Marxist feminist, Barbara Ehrenreich, prepares the reader:

> As a theory of fascism, Male Fantasies sets forth the jarring—and ultimately horrifying—proposition that the fascist is not doing “something else,” but doing what he wants to do. [...] When he penetrates a female adversary with a bullet or bayonet, he is not dreaming of rape. What he wants is what he gets, and that is what the Freikorpsmen describe over and over as a “bloody mass”: heads with their faces blown off, bodies soaked red in their own blood, rivers clogged with bodies. The reader’s impulse is to engage in a kind of mental flight—that is, to “read” the murders as a story about something else, for example, sex ... or the Oedipal triangle ... or anything to help the mind drift off. But Theweleit insists that we see and not “read” the violence.

She goes on to talk about history, the dark thought that eats at me now, the thing I don’t want to think is true:

> Reinforced by Marxism and later feminism, we have rejected the conventional history of “kings and battles” for the “hidden history” of everyday life, almost to the point of forgetting how much of everyday life has, century after century, been shaped by battles and dominated by kings or warrior elites: [...] the illiterate Greek chieftains on their decade-long excursion to the plains of Asia Minor; the tribal bands of Northern Europeans who raided Rome and then its Christian outposts; the Asiatic “hordes” who swept through medieval Europe; the Crusaders who looted the Arab world; the elite officership of European imperialism; and so on. These were men—not counting their conscripts and captives—who lived only parasitically in relation to the production of useful things, who lived for perpetual war, the production of death.

We are, perhaps only aspirationally but still meaningfully, little Agamemnons underneath the thin cloth of civilization we all wear. Recognizable but not. Primeval. Destructive without direction for any number of reasons, because someone didn’t hug us when we needed it, didn’t fuck us when we asked, didn’t give us that raise, didn’t flinch when we charged them. Took Briseis from us. It’s every old story come alive, vibrating with the awful possibility that we are nothing more than what we’ve been. Unheimlich.
