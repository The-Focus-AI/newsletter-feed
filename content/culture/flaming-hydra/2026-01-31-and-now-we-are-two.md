Happy Birthday, Flaming Hydra!

It’s our Birthday!! Our beloved many-headed mythical beast is two whole years old today. We are so proud to be publishing Issue No. 491 of Flaming Hydra exactly the same way as Issue No. 1 [https://flaminghydra.com/r/ea465f33?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]: as a cooperative wholly owned by our contributing writers and artists, with no ads and no outside investors. Flaming Hydra is editorially and financially independent and free to publish what we want, and we mean to continue this way forever.

A fiery roar of thanks to all our subscribers [https://flaminghydra.com/r/4a257d2f?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] and donors [https://flaminghydra.com/r/177b7cba?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], who are continuing to make this magic possible.

We’re also celebrating with a new Flaming Hydra Books [https://flaminghydra.com/r/96bd34c1?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] page, offering books written by Hydra contributors. We are linking to Moon Palace Books in Minneapolis to help support them in the struggle against fascism.

Here are some exceptional moments from year two of Flaming Hydra, unlocked for all to read and enjoy—a very small selection! it hurt to leave so many brilliant pieces out.

Thank you, everyone, so much, for reading and Supporting Our Serpent.
