Recurring Nightmare

It is 8:25 a.m. in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. I have been here for a week at the Festival of African Literature [https://flaminghydra.com/r/54a4495f?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], sophomore edition, organized by the Sharjah Book Authority, a government entity also involved in the annual Sharjah International Book Fair, which has apparently become a global destination for producers of literature. The organization seeks to “transform Sharjah into a global cultural hub by promoting literature, publishing, and a knowledge-based economy.”

A few days ago I was on a panel on language in translation [https://flaminghydra.com/r/6bdc03d4?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] with a distinguished Ethiopian writer, Ayalneh Mulatu Abeje; I shared my work with writers from other parts of the continent, and generally had a productive time networking, sightseeing, and enjoying the hospitality of this fascinating country. But my heart has remained in Minneapolis, my adoptive home city, where Trump and his goons have turned what was a pleasant, if frequently frigid, U.S. city into a scene of intentional chaos.

Friends and well-wishers have reached out to ask how we’re coping. Even here, all it takes is the mention of “Minneapolis” for genuine queries of concern to emerge, followed by long, spirited conversations. When I’m in Minnesota the news can be easy to ignore, if one avoids the television and stays offline, but the sighting of ICE agents in Brooklyn Park and other nearby suburbs has proven that we won’t be insulated for much longer, if we ever really were. Trump’s fixation on subduing a progressive state led by someone who once ran against him has brought a slow-burning combustion to the boiling point.

Every time I have tried to write about what is going on in America today, it overwhelms me in a way that prevents a true emotional reckoning. 

As a documentarian, I am trained to look for the narrative arc in the chaos, but as a father the lens is much narrower, and far more fragile. My teenage son is old enough now to read the tension in the headlines and in the faces of his friends, while my three-year-old is at an age where the safety provided by his parents is still an unspoken assumption. As I walk through the tranquil squares of Sharjah I am haunted by the knowledge that the quiet streets back home have been transformed, and are now filled with a different kind of reality. It is one thing to witness the rhymes of history in the contemplative space of a library or on a film set; it is quite another to realize that the bad dream of my Nigerian youth is now the backdrop of my children’s formative years, a place where no lease agreement or residency permit can truly protect anyone from a government determined to make an enemy of its own people.

----------------------------------------

 

I moved to a suburb of Minneapolis in the fall of 2022 after ten years away in Nigeria after grad school. I have family in the U.S. so it was a natural destination, though it always needed explaining that I, a citizen of a warm tropical country in West Africa, could find a place where the winters are six months long comfortable, or even habitable. The move to Minnesota was justified by the good schools, nice neighbours, walkable streets, and a healthy liberal government with the people at the heart of its work. But what was supposed to be a temporary trial move eventually became a semi-permanent one. Hard to believe that it will be four years soon.

Much of what I knew about the George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020, with Minneapolis at their epicenter, came from secondhand accounts and visuals from CNN during those pandemic days. Harrowing as that was, other traumas occupied our attention in Lagos. The civilian government in Nigeria had sent military men to open fire on unarmed protesters [https://flaminghydra.com/r/2b73e76c?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] at the Lekki toll gate in October 2020 to quell a riot against the state actors who, with continuing impunity, had made life hell for young people. I had been part of the early protests, which were peaceful. Days after the massacre I would wake up at night, depressed, wondering if the city was ever going to be a safe place to remain.

And now, having put some distance between me and those nervous nights, it’s hard to keep track of the many calamities and traumas that followed in both spaces. Our serene liberal bastion just south of Canada has taken over as a regular center of national news, from Philando Castile to Melissa Hortman, and now, Renee Nicole Good. The possibility of seeing Tim Walz as the Vice President of the United States, and the ascension of Peggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor, as the first Native American governor of a U.S. state, were a joy once dangled in our faces for a brief moment like honey cherry. Now all that is left is chaos engineered from the outside—a narcissistic president who will stop at nothing to punish his enemies, even at the risk of burning the country down.

The reality of the United States in this moment certainly doesn’t match the decades of branding as a nation of laws and “liberty and justice for all,” nor whatever imaginary notions I absorbed in the years of my youth and my studies, before I ever arrived there.

----------------------------------------

 

The solipsistic part of my mind interprets the world as a mere reflection of its own making. There’s no one else here, it says, but myself, experiencing a supernaturally-generated customized adventure that returns in cycles, appearing in similar rhymes. The torments return in similar ways, presenting new opportunities and new cycles of peace and repair, only to return again in the future like a bad dream. 

I did live under the military dictatorship of Babangida in the ’90s, after all, the smiling Nigerian dictator under whose rule the first of many letter bombs was detonated to kill a journalist [https://flaminghydra.com/r/753af56d?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. For eight years he killed or exiled those he couldn’t bend, and corrupted those he could. With a smile, and an appropriation of the word “president” for himself in the process, Babangida was eventually forced to hand over power. A sham election he conducted was annulled and a new dictatorship replaced him—one way worse, way less compromising, and even more corrupt. I remember the smell of tear gas unleashed on us, teenage students, during one of the public protests that followed Sani Abacha’s ascension, and the climate of fear under which so many civil rights leaders were killed, maimed, or sent into exile. So corrupt was the Abacha regime that to this day, Swiss and other banks are still regularly returning newly discovered loot he stole back to Nigeria [https://flaminghydra.com/r/73793da5?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122].

When Trevor Noah warned in 2016 that Trump reminded Africans of an African dictator [https://flaminghydra.com/r/e7449b58?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], it made all the sense in the world to someone whose formative years were spent on that continent. Now, ten years later, Trump has achieved a status that would make even an Idi Amin blush. 

I’m in the Middle East for a literary festival, trying to keep sane [https://flaminghydra.com/r/7c14fdf3?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] in the middle of a world threatening to burn every few hours. I return home shortly to Minneapolis, where concerned citizens have risen up to defend the values they hold dear, and projected some measure of strength to me here, far away. Somali-American residents who have had to endure the brunt of the invasion have handled themselves with poise [https://flaminghydra.com/r/5bd970d7?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], confidence, [https://flaminghydra.com/r/bb34c166?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122] and resilience [https://flaminghydra.com/r/c139266e?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]. But the city is not the same any more [https://flaminghydra.com/r/fae11106?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122], nor the country, nor even Nigeria [https://flaminghydra.com/r/25424ca0?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122]; something will have changed even after the despot is gone.
