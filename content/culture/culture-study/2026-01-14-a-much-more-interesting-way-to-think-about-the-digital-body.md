There's this dystopian vision of a world where we all walk around with a shit-ton of all-seeing all-knowing digital implants. They're in our eyes and our ears; they're injected into our brains. In recent years, I've found these depictions increasingly uncanny — in part, I think, because they're no longer fantasy. They feel one step forward in time. "The future" but fucked, like Children of Men meets Minority Report with a whole bunch of Her.

But all of those visions, are, well, cinema. They're meant to be spectacular. They have value — but so, too, do the utterly fascinating histories of how humans have considered, rejected, and incorporated machines into their bodies and lives. If you want to think in more interesting, complicated, and layered ways about our increasingly digital bodies — this interview with Vanessa Chang is for you. (Or maybe you just want to think about how the foot is a technology! That shit is fascinating! Keep reading!!!)

Let's start with the basics. How do you define ‘the digital body,’ both past and present?

For many people, "the digital body" might seem like an oxymoron. Stories about digital technologies — both fictional and real — tend to emphasize how much they divorce us from our bodies. Life unfolds through smartphone apps, Zoom calls, Reddit boards, metaverse avatars, and increasingly, disembodied chatbots. These technologies are designed to be seamless, to disappear into the background of daily life. But I want to remind us of the body seated in that chair, hunched over a laptop, walking through the city with a phone in hand. We remain deeply rooted in our bodies, even as digital technologies fundamentally shape that embodiment—how we see, hear, move, and feel through the world around us.

Technologies have long choreographed our bodies and primed our senses: keyboards train our hands, smartphones script our attention, earbuds filter our soundscapes, and chatbots train us to write and think in new patterns. These tools aren't simply objects; they're architectures that organize our bodies in space and time. My book explores how these architectures give form to what I call the digital body: the ways we feel, move, and become through and alongside digital technologies.

Crucially, this relationship is reciprocal. We shape these technologies even as they shape us. As I write in the book, "the digital body is not an abstraction—it is us, becoming, again and again, in the technologies we build and the worlds we inhabit." The digital body is a living archive of this ongoing dialogue between human bodies and the technologies that mediate our lives. Understanding it helps us see what's at stake in who gets to design our future embodiment.

Today, in a world dominated by digital platforms, that dialogue has become concentrated in the hands of a few corporate actors. How you swipe, type, and tap are gestures that are both deeply personal and utterly standardized, defined by the companies that build the interfaces you use daily. If you're an iPhone user, a Galaxy feels like alien territory. These design decisions aren’t neutral; they choreograph how our bodies engage with the world around us.

Reading your book brought up a wonderful memory of a grad seminar I took in Vision and Visuality, which led me to think more than I had before, or ever, about how technologies like the camera obscura and the stereoscope affected the way people saw, and sought to see, just generally. Your book explores (in fascinating detail!) the way that technologies and our bodies (and sense) have almost co-evolved, and I’d love for readers here to get a taste of that — maybe we could talk about sound/hearing (‘the digital ear!’) and the foot? (Foot as technology is so amazing)

I think expansively about technology, taking my cue from Ursula Le Guin, who called it "the active human interface with the material world." This includes not just smartphones or satellites but roads, clothing, energy—technology interwoven into the fabric of human existence. Across this interface, so much more than information travels: our beliefs, our relationships, our cultures, our affects. Every technological encounter is a drama of skin, bone, rhythm, and power. Technologies refine, track, translate, and choreograph our behaviors; in so doing, they generate new languages of feeling, moving, and knowing. This same choreography animates the digital body. Each chapter broadly traces the co-evolution of a body part and technology from craft to clockwork to code—from handmade tools to mechanical and then algorithmic automation.

I’ll briefly walk through those two examples.

The Ear chapter traces the evolution of the ear as a social organ, exploring how listening has shifted from an embodied, collective experience to a computational process—and what that shift means for how we know, love, and recognize one another. This chapter begins with an acapella choir, which I frame as kind of a primeval listening situation. Our ears have historically been enmeshed in sonic community, bathed in human and animal choruses alike. Gathered in a room with others, united by song, breath leaves a body as sound, which enters another as vibration. Listening in this context is fundamentally social; because sound is ephemeral, disappearing at the moment it is made, a speaker and a listener must share the same space and time.

Music boxes and other musical automata prototyped a new form of sociality: listening alone. These machines forged the channels that would lead to our digital ears. The advent of sound recording technologies such as the phonograph and later, the cassette tape, went further still. By untethering sound from its source, sound technologies transform sound from an event into an object. The cassette tape laid two foundations for the auditory worlds we inhabit today. First, personal stereo, the Walkman, made private, portable soundscapes possible (a radical development at the time!). Cassettes also gave birth to a new social form: the mixtape. For those of you of similar vintage to me, making and sharing mixtapes was a love language spoken with technology, a labor-intensive practice of knowing and being known through sound.

Today, algorithmic curation on platforms like Spotify has absorbed and automated that role. Personal, highly curated stereo is now available whenever we wish on our phones. But where mixtapes revealed how much someone knew and loved you, Spotify's algorithmic curator can't know you—it's only sifting your data. My recommendations, for instance, are a dog's breakfast of art rock, kids' music, and Motown. The platform doesn’t know that my account is a tug-of-war between my 4-year-old and I. Digital ears inhabit systems built on, and masquerading as, longstanding organic communities. Once attuned to other bodies singing and speaking, our ears now exist within computational networks that promise personalization bereft of real intimacy.

Where the Ear chapter explores the sociality of sound, the Foot chapter considers how one of our most fundamental interactions with our environment, walking, co-evolves with the infrastructure around us.

I begin with the basic encounter of foot and earth, which becomes inscribed in paths. Paths become roads, and roads become highways–technologies we rarely recognize as such, but which, like all technologies, shape how bodies move, gather, and belong. From this humble origin, I trace the blossoming of cities and how urban infrastructures choreograph movement. Cities built for cars can effectively exile walkers, with major consequences for social life, health, and community. Through figures like the 19th century flaneur and the Situationist avant-garde, who treated wandering as a revolutionary act, I cast the city as a lab for the future of the human body. Our feet have always been central to how we imagine and inhabit metropolitan landscapes.

As cities become increasingly digital, increasingly “smart,” walking becomes more fraught. The dialogue between foot, body, and world becomes conscripted into data-driven systems: 10,000 steps on a pedometer, dynamic mapping tools like Google Maps, smart city dashboards—all aiming for optimization, whether individual or metropolitan. In other words, the digital body is not just shaped by interfaces on our screens, but by the infrastructures beneath our feet.

Just as streetcars and cars reshaped our pathways and the bodies that traverse them, the infrastructures of smart cities are beginning to reshape the interface of our bodies and environments, portending a future where our movements are governed as much by data and algorithms as by the rhythms of human experience.

Our little library on the island where I live recently held a “Drawing Your Memories” class — I just walked by the sign for it this morning — which made me think of your own description of what happened during your drawing class, how your hand became a conduit (a tool!) for memory. You write: “Hands are smart. Hands are curious. Hands learn. Hands know things.” And hands are very difficult, you argue, to automate. Telling ChatGBT what to draw of my memory doesn’t have the same effect as trying to draw it myself; my drawing might not be as exact, but it does have the soul of the thing.

But maybe I’m being too romantic about all of this? Didn’t people think the same thing about how cameras couldn’t and cannot adequately capture the soul of a place in the same way as a painting? Or how the piece of film that requires us to squint our eye to take it — the Polaroid, the traditional camera — is more soul-catching than the camera we take on our phone, with the tool held at a distance?

When we talk about what is ‘lost’ by relying more on the digital tool and less on the one guided by our body, what are we actually talking about?

You’re right to highlight the familiarity of this critique. Photography was once dismissed as less authentic, less expressive, less embodied than painting. In the 19th century, the poet Charles Baudelaire called photography “art’s mortal enemy” and “the refuge of every would-be painter” because it seemed to require less skill, less time than painting, and could be mechanically reproduced without the artist’s presence. A century later, similar anxieties emerged around Photoshop. And yet, photography became an expressive art form on its own terms.

Even so, something is often lost with technological development–or at least changed in ways worth examining. What’s at stake isn’t quite soul but a particular kind of knowing and being that emerges through a body’s encounter with material over time. There’s a wonderful Saul Steinberg drawing called “[The Line,](https://saulsteinbergfoundation.org/artwork/the-line-1954/)” a 10-meter accordion-fold drawing in which a single hand-drawn line traverses 29 panels, metamorphosing into a railroad track, a desert horizon, a sidewalk, a clothesline, a table’s edge, and on. It travels through time and space at human scale and pace–the scale of a body, and the pace of a hand thinking through drawing.

Some landscape architects have lamented the adoption of CAD (computer-assisted design) for similar reasons, likening drawing on paper to walking through a landscape. The handmade preserves a specifically human scale of bodies moving through space and time; it sustains a conversation between body and material. Digital tools can shortcircuit that negotiation between hand, world, and imagination. In practice, that can have palpable impact on spaces that are designed and built with them, and on the people who live, work, and play there.

But I don’t think digital tools are inherently less embodied. They could be more grounded in our bodies if we designed them that way, and with more attention to the diversity of bodies that inhabit our world. Instead, because so much technological production is consolidated within major tech companies, these tools are often designed to commandeer our attention, calibrate our desires, and harvest our data.

So when we ask what is “lost” when we rely on a digital tool, we’re actually talking about two dimensions of experience. One is the knowledge that comes from physical engagement–are we giving up the embodied processes that cultivate memory, creativity, curiosity, and expertise? The other relates to power: who designs these tools and who do they ultimately serve?

I know of die-hard AI-heads who record all of their conversations, store all of their emails and texts and chats, and feed all of it into their preferred form of AI in order to create a sort of “second consciousness,” which immediately makes me think of Clark and Chalmers’ work on “the extended mind" and the general blurriness of where our mind stops and the computer’s processing begins.

The speed of publishing means that the book can’t address the most 2025 uses of AI, but this is the first book I’ve encountered that manages to feel very in touch with the now, in part, I’m guessing, because you were thinking very seriously about AI and its promises before most of us were.

What do you see missing from most popular discourse around AI, just generally? What would you like to see more of?

When people talk about AI, they often mean large language models like ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini. These really are powerful systems developing at breakneck speed as companies pour vast resources into them, and they are being integrated into many aspects of life, from business to education. The discourse around these tends to echo a familiar language of disembodiment: AI is immaterial and frictionless.

Thinkers like Kate Crawford and Karen Hao have done amazing work calling attention to the ways in which that language of disembodiment obscures the immense human labor and ecological harm behind these extractive technologies. But AI is bigger than LLMs. It is already embedded in our physical world in ways we rarely notice. That’s one of the central themes in my book: even the most mundane technologies choreograph our bodies. From autocorrect (my daily nemesis!) to algorithmic playlists to robotaxis and Uber drivers guided by algorithms, intelligent algorithms hum beneath the infrastructure of our daily lives. They script our interactions, plot our journeys, and pattern our soundscapes. Just recently, I walked out of my house on garbage collection day to see the garbage truck trapped by no less than three Waymos (robotaxis) — and the frustrated driver said it was the second time that morning.

That said, I think we need a more grounded public conversation about AI that moves beyond the hate/hype binary. I want us to ask what kinds of technologies reflect our values and what kind of infrastructures would allow those technologies to flourish. With AI being orchestrated by a handful of major companies motivated by profit, that can seem impossibly hard. But there are projects that model another paradigm.

Karen Hao, for example, has written about a Māori project in rural New Zealand where an indigenous couple is training natural-language processing algorithms to help revitalize the Māori language. They sought, and were granted, permission from local iwi; they collaborated with local Māori community groups; they gathered audio data from community members who were enthusiastic participants. They are building the project with a commitment to data sovereignty, so the community owns its own data. The whole pipeline, from dataset to code, is grounded in community values and collective governance.

My book draws on similar principles from design justice, especially work led by disabled people, who have long innovated with technology to forge access where none was built for bodies that don’t fit a small norm. This accessibility lens reveals a core truth: that technologies encode beliefs about who they are for, who counts, and who must adapt. Bringing these lessons into AI discourse means recognizing that systems inherit the values, exclusions, and worldviews of the people and institutions that build them.

Recently I was asked what technology I would create, or what investment I would make, if money were no object. Rather than a gadget or app, my answer is infrastructural. I would invest in an infrastructure of care, and in education, so that more people can be represented in the technologies they use. If we want AI to reflect human values, we need to build the conditions under which more humans get to define what those values are.

This is not a readership of luddites — but it is a readership that is thoughtful, particularly around new technologies and how they change the way we interact with each other and our lived environment. You argue quite beautifully that we should approach technology from a framework of whether it “expands or contracts our horizons” — whether it makes us more curious, more complex….or “reduce[s] us to what can be measured and predicted.”

I’ve been thinking about this a lot in relation to my exercise watch, and I’ve found that my answer can change with the season or the year: there are times when it makes me really curious about what my body can do, and there are times when I feel like it’s limiting my understanding of self and reducing me to the miles I have (or, more recently, have not run). So much depends on what it can and cannot measure, and I’ve increasingly felt that I was ceding authority (over my body!) to it.

I’ve been running without turning it on lately, and feeling like I’m a teen sneaking out at night, fooling their surveilling parent. You don’t even know my life! This is also my second period of watch-rejection, so it feels like a manifestation of a larger ebb and flow in my life: when I begin to feel like a tool of the watch, instead of the other way around, I distance myself from its power. I see myself do the same thing with social media, too, cycling through periods of appreciating it as a tool and distancing myself from it.

Do you see this in your life, or in the lives of those around you? Does it have a cool history I can use to explain it? Is this just our way of trying to figure out the parameters of our ever-changing digital bodies, and do you have thoughts on how to do it with even more thoughtfulness???

I think many of us are developing our own strategies for setting boundaries around the technologies that shape our daily embodiment. Some people delete their social accounts entirely. Others keep them but remove the apps from their phones — I’m in this camp. Many parents stay online but blur their kids’ faces to prevent easy harvesting by facial-recognition systems. A while ago, I stopped charging my phone by my bed. It’s a small gesture, but it’s been a gamechanger for my sleep and gives me a little buffer of peace at the bookends of the day.

Digital technologies bring enormous convenience and possibility into our lives. I live across the world from my family; being able to see them on a video call at almost no cost is priceless. But the trade-offs are real, and they can’t all be managed with individual willpower or better habits.

This is why I love your approach to reclaiming control over your exercise watch. As you say, it’s your tool—you’re not its tool. And it doesn’t know you, can’t know you. We are not data. I’m always amused checking my step count after a music festival; the watch can’t distinguish steps taken while dancing from steps taken while walking. It quantifies movement but can’t understand meaning.

There’s actually an interesting historical precedent for this kind of resistance. In the Foot chapter, I discuss the Situationists, a mid-20th century avant-garde group who proposed the dérive, or “drift” — a playful wandering through the city that lets the terrain guide you rather than your routines or obligations. Instead of treating the city as a machine for work, the dérive reclaims it as a space for experimentation and sensory discovery.

I think this offers a compelling frame for your relationship to your watch. You can allow it to serve you — just as a city can — but you don’t have to submit to its logic of optimization. You can drift, wander, and play; you can reclaim movement as something other than a metric. As a curator and cultural producer working with artists who use advanced technologies, I’m constantly reminded that creativity can short-circuit the numbing habits that these systems encourage. Finding what the Situationists called “playful-constructive” ways to engage with our tools is one answer.

But there are limits to what personal responsibility can accomplish. To use most digital systems at all is to acquiesce to extensive and often absurd terms and conditions. Data surveillance and extraction, algorithmic assumptions about who we are and what we want, are highly effective and they aren’t problems individuals can solve by setting better boundaries or being more creative. These are collective, infrastructural problems, not individual ones.

This is why I keep returning to the importance of thinking ecologically about technology. Our tools don’t just shape individual habits; they shape environments, expectations, and norms. A friend recently asked me how, as a woman nearing 40 who doesn’t want children, she’s supposed to manage the unrelenting ads and algorithmic assumptions about her reproductive future. The truth is: she shouldn’t have to. If we want healthier relationships with technology, we have to build healthier technological ecosystems — not just better coping strategies. ▪️
