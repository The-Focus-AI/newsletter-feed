First: Minnesotans are taking care of their neighbors — but they need our help. This weekend, Culture Study is raising money to support 50 families in the Powderhorn neighborhood who've been unable to leave their homes to work because of ICE surveillance. This money goes directly to back rent, utilities, and the coming month's rent, which will be due next week. It's spectacularly easy to donate [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-powderhorn-families-in-crisis).

I also wrote a little bit about Trump's miscalculation of Minnesota [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/DT29OrQjVMe/) — I'm very proud to be a stubborn Minnesotan today and every day.

And now, because every day is a day of cultural whiplash, let's do the Friday Thread. Today's prompt comes from Kidsleepy, who wonders:

What have you spent money on that wasn’t worth it? De-influence me!

I've been thinking of this question all week — sometimes these purchases get buried in our brains so we feel less shame about them — and have come up with a few small but instructive ones:

Linen sheets (they're nice sure but guys they rip SO EASILY)

a Le Creuset pot (instead of a Lodge, which is pretty much exactly the same)

a coffee machine that cost more than $80 (if you're just a person who drinks normal drip coffee at home)

Trex Decking (sorry I hate it and I hate it even more because I spent so much money on it)

a set of big outdoor pots from Pottery Barn (supposed to be an upgrade from the standard Lowe's ones I love; they suck)

a car wash over $8 (also cars don't need washing unless they've been pelted with salt water on the ferry like mine is)

an unfunded Master's Degree (I said what I said)

covered airport parking (I love my uncovered $10 a day gravel lot that you can walk to from Sea-Tac so much, why would you pay for more)

an iPad (I have a phone, I have a computer, why do I need a large phone computer)

But what have YOU spent money on that wasn't worth it? Tell us about it, why you spent money on it, and why it didn't feel worth it — and remember that "worth it" is a HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE designation; just because someone's saying something wasn't worth it to them does not mean that it is fundamentally worthless, or that you're "wrong" for feeling like it's worth it to you, etc etc. People are different. This is one of many times we get to explore how. ...
