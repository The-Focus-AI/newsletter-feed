First: there's so little coverage of what's happening in Minneapolis/St.Paul right now, but ICE's purpose is surveillance, spectacle, violence, and outright terror. We've listed a bunch of resources in [subscriber-thread-adjacent-chat](https://www.patreon.com/messages/158858d170bc4ed6a604b7f47d83ab2b?mode=campaign&tab=chats&utm_id=40e538e6-fdc8-420d-bbff-cb47d3ec0289&utm_medium=email). You can also donate very easily to the Minnesota Immigration Rights Action Committee [via Venmo](https://venmo.com/u/miracmn) [or Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=JX3R6PLUHCMWC&source=url&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQMMjU2MjgxMDQwNTU4AAGntyP6S9qfAEKAHcXt_fPZ-rkzk07vH1eA9zxWuiHG2A3ebxxbHrVSVArCfkI_aem_dDNvq5IdnBPovSGZNUcrXA) — or follow their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/miracmn/?hl=en) and amplify their work.

I know it feels weird to have mini-bulletins like this before talking about pop culture or personality tests or WHATEVER but this is what life is like right now: constant compartmentalization and negotiation.

The idea for today's thread comes from Elizabeth (commenting in last week's [meta-thread](https://www.patreon.com/posts/147502802?utm_id=40e538e6-fdc8-420d-bbff-cb47d3ec0289&utm_medium=email)!) who asks:

[I want to her about] the ways different “self-knowledge” systems have and have not served you! I’m thinking astrology, tarot, the Enneagram, Meyers Briggs, etc. What valuable insight did they open for you? What’s BS? What’s “sticky” in these tools and practices for people?

I'm hoping we can approach this question with curiosity and humor — if they don't work at all for you, you can say that without saying THESE ARE QUACKERY, for example. Speak from your own experience, ask and answer questions in good faith, remember that something doesn't have to be FOR EVERYONE for it to be useful for self-understanding, and let's try hard to keep this one of the good places on the internet. ...
