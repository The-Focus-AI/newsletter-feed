Interviews like this are why I am so happy to run this newsletter. Like, this is what it's all about: a reader who emails me with great passion about their field of expertise (and new book), and then answers all of my questions with such exquisite, nerdy, yet deeply compelling detail that you think you're reading about why science writing is so hard to get right and then suddenly you're learning about the 19th century German model of higher education and a British woman, born to a laborer, who became a world-famous paleontologist?!?! THIS IS CULTURE STUDY!!

To be more precise: this is CS reader and community member Bethann Garramon Merkle making a rollercoaster ride of a case for 1) why we need better science writing and 2) how to make it happen. It'll fill you with questions and answers. I feel privileged to be able to publish this interview without taking out the most fascinating parts because of word count — and I feel equally lucky to have a readership that responds to these sorts of journeys with curiosity. Read on and get excited to find yourself where you'd least expect. This one's a classic of the CS interview genre.

Okay let’s start very simple: what is most science writing like, and what sort of instruction do most people communicating about science (whether as scientists themselves or not) receive about writing?

Well, actually, to be a complete nerd, we should start with a clear distinction/definition of science writing and scientific writing. And then another one: for communicating about science in the sense that we might mean sharing science with non-specialists. To do all that, I also need to clarify that when I say “science” I’m talking about Euro-American science. There are a lot of other important ways of knowing and approaches to science, some of which significantly predate Euro-American dominance of modern science discourse. But, when we (in the U.S.) talk about science in the sense of academic norms, we’re typically talking about Euro-American science.

Now, for those distinctions, I find a pair of nested dolls a useful visual metaphor.

Scientific writing is the smallest, most narrowly focused doll. Scientific writing is primarily for other specialists (i.e., academics, science trainees, industry researchers, nonprofit scientists, federal agency scientists, etc.). Adjacent to scientific writing is science writing, which has a broader scope and could encompass either (1) all writing about science (see where the figures overlap in the graphic) or (2) only what some folks call “popular” writing (aka non-academic/beyond specialists/anyone). That latter framing is useful, because it’s the kind of writing about science you might find in a major periodical, a blog, a nature essay, or books about science for popular readers (aka, books published by the Big 5, indie presses, etc. Some popular science books do get published by academic presses, too, but that’s a gray area, as university presses also publish scientific books). Now, scientific communication (e.g., reports, academic presentations, etc.), includes scientific writing, but not science writing (see right two triangles in image).

And then, science writing nests inside a larger “doll” as well: sharing science (aka science communication/scicomm). Here, we’re talking about things like science shared in a museum, on a bird walk with a local Audubon group, or when a local government or individual reads about or talks with subject-matter experts about science that can help address a specific need/problem. At its best, scicomm is science, meaning science is ideally co-produced, and scientists/researchers work closely with a community or impacted group from the beginning (to define research questions, plan out research methods, everything). However, in its worst stereotype version, science is just scientific writing, and not much else.

Most scientific writing, which is what our book is interested in improving, is dry, technical text aimed at conveying specific information, in a traditional format, to other specialists or trainees in a particular field/subfield of research. I could include an example snippet here, if that would be helpful/of interest. This writing is published largely in peer-reviewed papers (aka articles, manuscripts), which are the coin of the realm in terms of credibility and bean-counting in academia (and have been since at least the mid-1700s!). These papers are the foundations of what scientists teach, study, and even argue about. Ideally, the work in these papers helps inform decisions, policies, and actions that have a beneficial effect on the wider world.

However, most of this kind of writing is locked up behind paywalls in peer-reviewed journals, and is therefore both targeting only a limited population but also only available to an even smaller population. These journals tend to charge a huge amount of money both to researchers to publish — a rabbit hole we can go down if your readers are interested, but really that’s an infuriating tangent (as you well know) — and also charge whopping fees to readers. As a result, most people who access peer-reviewed papers are doing so through the libraries at their academic institutions, since these libraries allocate the majority of their budgets to paying massive subscription fees to journal companies.

So, the grim truth is that not only is this writing technical, dry, formulaic, and locked up behind paywalls, but it is also, counterintuitively, the main output by which scientists are evaluated and upon which they cast most of their hopes for making an actual difference for people and the planet. Hopefully the impossibility of all this is clear. If it’s not, I can say/write more.

What makes it even better worse is that most of our academic training, from at least high school onward, is geared towards an expectation that science-trained folks will do scientific writing. This norm exists because scientific knowledge is really the accretion of myriad, individual insights (documented through those peer-reviewed papers). So, these papers are tiny pieces of building blocks that incrementally add up to the understandings and questions of modern science, both as an approach to discern knowledge and as a host of technical subfields.

This would be fine, if a bit boring, except: most folks who train in science, at any level, will never write a peer-reviewed paper. Seriously. The stats on who will become a research-active scientist with the funding to pursue research to publication are so grim. And also, we don’t need every person with a bachelor’s or graduate degree to become an academic. They don’t even need to become agency, industry, or nonprofit research scientists. What society needs is hosts of people with science training to go out into the world and apply that knowledge to all sectors and functions. Those people will need to do a lot of other kinds of writing, but we do not prepare them for it because higher ed remains fixated on scientific writing.

And even though scientific writing is the expectation, we mostly do not train people to write this way! That wasn’t a typo: we traditionally do not teach people to do the primary thing they are expected to do in academia. Higher ed in North America (and most places, to be honest) just tells students and trainees to write this way.

Telling someone “read a few papers and write like that” is not a viable instructional strategy, either. Doing that perpetuates some really problematic aspects of the hierarchies of academia. For starters, scientific writing is not at all similar to conversational speech or writing. It is rhetorically unlike most of the books we read, podcasts we listen to, or shows we watch for fun and education. It is categorically foreign to the modes of discourse we see on social media and in texting. Even professional emails are much less formal and less formulaic.

On top of all that — or really, underneath it all — is the (fascinating, at least to me) history of why academia in the U.S. operates this way. The short story is: the people who set up U.S. higher ed were obsessed with the German system. The longer, nerdy story is that the German system went through some pretty major transitions from the 1500s-1700s, that primed it to then in the 1800s begin resembling what we recognize here in the U.S. today. Here are a couple of key things to know:

For thousands of years, universities were vocational schools that first taught European and Middle Eastern elite men to become clergy (and later lawyers, doctors, etc.).

From roughly the 1500s-1700s, some aspects of what we now recognize as higher ed in the U.S. were extant, including that professors were paid poorly, and only to teach. And hiring was profoundly nepotistic. What was different then was that governments had control of curricula, and they emphasized these elite vocations. Thus, research as we know it was done outside universities — by civil and court employees, folks who were independently wealthy, and/or members of scientific societies.

In the mid-1700s, some philosophers working at German universities argued that academia should also be a place to pursue “pure knowledge,” not just provide career prep to students. In 1786, Kant defined science — more or less as an organized study of/pursuit of a body of knowledge, which was a novel contribution. Science the way we understand it hadn’t really been conceptualized or practiced yet. The combo of these pressures/ideas initiated scholarly specialization into disciplines/fields, with philology (comparative study of languages) and philosophy leading the way.

Following a series of unfortunate events for common folk, the environment, and the crushing of Prussia’s higher ed system under Napoleon’s rule, Prussia made peace with France and began rebuilding its higher education system in the early 1800s. By this point the Romantics’ call for research/learning for its own sake, and the expectation for specialized, original research, were driving the bus. In 1810, a new university was established in Berlin, and its function was — uniquely and novelly — to teach men to think critically and seek new knowledge (not “merely” prep for elite careers as was the case in the Enlightenment era and before). This is also when and where the first non-medical doctoral degrees were issued…in philosophy (as we still see for nearly all PhDs today).

There’s plenty more to say about all that. But that sequence then tees us up for [the heyday of natural history](https://archive.org/details/heydayofnaturalh0000barb/page/n5/mode/2up) in Europe, especially the UK. While there was an amateur boom that contributed substantially (e.g., Mary Anning’s fossils, etc.), at some point elite, White men deemed natural history too accessible. Wanting to gatekeep prestige and expertise, they did many things to make science more exclusive. One of these efforts was that they formalized how and where science was presented: in writing, with a supposedly neutral, “objective” tone, presented to exclusive, scientific societies with highly controlled membership. They entrenched the idea that research and methodically uncovered insights could only be valid if they were done and presented dispassionately — and the subtext was that only certain strata of society were capable of this objectivity.

(Hopefully my tone is clear here: this was racist, classist nonsense. We are subjective beings. To my mind, and I’m by no means the first to say so, it is legitimate to use the methodical approaches of science to acknowledge and account for our subjectivity. But pretending we can be objective is a lie that starts with the reality that most folks don’t even get a chance at science, and those who do, when we choose to study something specific, have already indicated preference.)

Anyway…fast forward to now, and we have:

a niche genre,

written in a faux-objective, over-formalized tone unlike how we communicate in any other format/fora,

inaccessible to most readers due to paywalls and that forced formality of tone,

which reports on highly complex, specialized areas of knowledge and study using necessarily specific jargon,

that all science trainees are expected to gain proficiency in,

without being taught to do so, and without most of them ultimately likely to write this way once they graduate.

With no guidance towards critical reading, rhetorical analysis, and the like, students predictably struggle to imitate, let alone learn and gain competency in, this niche genre. But all around them are people seemingly finding it easy to do so. (Students primarily see only published papers or awarded grants, not the hours, and decades, of drafting, rejections, etc., that people further along in our careers have experienced and continue to navigate.) Meanwhile students’ own writing comes back to them flooded with red pen slashes. After all, the people providing them feedback were likewise not trained to write or talk about writing, so the best most instructors and mentors can do is make line edits that aim to “fix” obvious issues like subject-verb agreements, word choice, punctuation, etc. And yet, what most developing writers need is help understanding how to make ideas and content into words, organize those words into big thematic chunks, calibrate the complexity appropriately for a given readership, etc. It’s not until the [very last developmental stages](https://schoolofgoodtrouble.substack.com/p/three-stages-of-manuscript-development) that line editing/polishing is helpful or appropriate. But, because most STEM folks don’t know how to talk about writing or writing development, line editing is often the only direct instruction students and trainees receive.

Given all this, it is sadly predictable that science students become quickly (often within the first semester) convinced that they alone are uniquely incompetent. They rapidly develop a deep sense of shame, and because they’re not trained to talk about or practice writing in front of others in STEM, they become increasingly isolated and despairing.

The problem here is existential — [my latest published research on this](https://doi.org/10.1080/87567555.2024.2407121) (paper is not be paywalled!) — points to the deep emotional distress students experience around their writing. My collaborators and I actually hypothesize that these writing-related issues are a major factor in the ~50% attrition rate for grad students in the U.S

That's the longer answer to your question. The short answer is that most people receive no instruction about scientific writing. And even though the number of people in the U.S. receiving college degrees (at any level) in STEM has steadily increased for decades, and most of those graduates will do a lot of other professional things, most of these people never receive instruction (or even encouragement) to learn to communicate about science beyond their field. In fact, [too many people are discouraged from sharing science](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biae080/7815615?utm_source=authortollfreelink&utm_campaign=bioscience&utm_medium=email&guestAccessKey=032f51ec-8a60-4bcd-b7a2-eb1b8ef390e8&login=false), as it is perceived to be a low-value use of their time (think emotional and administrative labor at work or home) versus the prestigious work of research.

If all this feels like a dead-end, I agree that it seems hopeless on the surface. It’s almost sloppy to say: “Ta-daaa. That’s why we’re in the national and global mess we’re in.” But, there is some truth in that blaming. At the same time, of course, the state of our society pivots on more fulcrums than whether a scientist can write — or whether someone with a bachelor’s degree believes that it takes more than just facts to communicate about science effectively over a holiday meal or at a city council meeting.

Still, it does absolutely matter whether people can communicate about science meaningfully, ethically, and effectively. And, we do know how to teach them! The amazing thing is that while we generally ignore and/or fail at this in the sciences, people in the humanities and social sciences have been studying how to teach writing for more than half a century!

Okay, now I'd love to connect this history with how you came to write your latest book.

I learned to write and do scicomm well because all my degrees are from humanities and arts, not science. And then, my whole career has been in, adjacent to, and/or in support of science. I have wanted to write this book we’re talking about for almost a decade, because I saw the gap between what was known about effective writing instruction in other fields versus how poorly it’s handled in STEM. Part of that gap is predictable — most scientists don’t spend their time reading the research literature from disciplines as seemingly far afield as English. So most of those insights have just never made it to the STEM side of campus.

I tried sharing the research and writing pedagogy books — especially [this one](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Engaging+Ideas%3A+The+Professor) — with colleagues, but it quickly became clear that the jargon of writing pedagogy wasn’t super accessible, and neither were the teaching scenarios discussed in all these books by/for writing programs, English departments, etc. Mind you, lots of writing self-help books exist. There are STEM specific ones, including [a great one](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691219202/the-scientists-guide-to-writing-2nd-edition) by [my co-author](https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/) of the current book. And, then there are the hosts of broader writing books (including [Bird by Bird](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/97395/bird-by-bird-by-anne-lamott/), [Conversations on Writing](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/conversations-on-writing), and so on). But, neither the writing pedagogy books nor the writing self-help for writers books were bridging the gap of “how to teach writing in STEM.”

So, I eventually recruited a co-author, and we pitched our own book to fill the gap! Our book translates the insights about writing instruction into vocabulary, examples, and curricular advice that scientists can actually relate to.

My hope is that this book can genuinely help people who throw their hands up in frustration and despair over the skills students/trainees lack as writers.

But more than that, our book is meant to help scientists, who themselves were not trained to write (and largely aren’t trained to teach, either!!!), to:

build a vocabulary for talking about writing,

understand writing instruction and development as incremental and iterative, and

acknowledge and support the deeply emotional aspects of becoming a strong writer.

These are all really hard parts of becoming a better writer or mentoring writers, especially when the writing is such a niche genre as scientific writing.

Then there’s one more “fun” layer: teaching and taking science content or skill courses (e.g., biology, coding in Python) are valued the most, although teaching is valued less than research. And typically, writing and communication courses are electives, if offered at all.

So, we have faculty and instructors discouraged from teaching writing and communication, who have themselves not been trained to write — and thus do not have a vocabulary around the craft of writing — who are also seldom trained to teach anything, least of all writing, and…well, it should also not surprise us that people aren’t being taught to write in the sciences. Who would do that teaching?!

Have people always been bad at communicating about science? Why do I have this weird idea that the holistic liberal arts education created gentleman scholars like, I dunno, Darwin, who were doing all the science and doing all the writing? Do we feel it acutely because there’s so much public distrust in science right now? Have there been other moments when there’s been a push to communicate better?

Oh, what a fun question! I’ve actually never thought about it in quite that way! In a way, yes, some people might have once been “better” at communicating science beyond academia. There are inflection points along the history of how higher education formed, and how science shifted from being the study/practice of philosophy, theology, etc., into an array of natural and physical sciences that left space for “genteel” amateurs (in the French sense, meaning that they may not have had formal training, but they were so avid in their interests that they became experts) to be good at communicating their knowledge somewhat “better.” But, there were still limitations.

Euro-American science has always been the domain of people with enough money to have time to pursue curiosity methodically. In the beginnings of the life/natural sciences as recognizable disciplines, for example, it was acceptable and encouraged for merchant and noble classes to study ferns, mosses, fossils, and so on. Certain domains were considered more appropriate for women (meaning other domains were more exclusionary), but even then, a person with sufficient financial or social resources could find their way into being a regional or international expert on some aspect of the natural world (see, for example, [Beatrix Potter being an accomplished mycologist](https://minervascientifica.co.uk/beatrix-potter/) or [Mary Anning, a laborer’s daughter, becoming a fossil expert](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/mary-anning-unsung-hero.html)).

Obsessed with this image of Mary Anning and some of her discoveries

For a lot of the history of Euro-American science (starting with Aristotle at least), much of this knowledge was circulated as correspondence, and many people were trained to both write and draw what they saw in ways that would document what they learned, convincingly interpret what they saw, and make their observations conceptually and visually legible to others. This intuitive exchange through letter-writing eventually merged with the publish-or-perish norms of the German system. At some point, all of Europe and North America, and anywhere European educational traditions had penetrated through colonization or trade, embraced a tradition of writing a focused “paper” or lecture and delivering it to an interest group.

These groups were the founding scientific societies across Europe and eventually Canada and the U.S. at first, along with the celebrity scientists giving lecturers and seminar courses in 1700s-1800s German universities. As certain classes and ethnicities of men decided that science needed to be more methodical, they were likewise advocating for it to remain or become again more exclusive. The specialization of science led to an eventual, overt professionalization of science and thus scientific writing.

Throughout all these developments, scientists and amateurs across Europe and the U.S. were writing about what they were learning. Those books weren’t calibrated for popular reading, but remember that literacy was still an exclusive skill through most of the time period we’ve been talking about — and writing about science and most everything else was primarily done in Latin, not in vernacular, regional languages. For centuries, only clergy could read and write, and then they were the ones to initially create centers of learning that became universities. It wasn’t until the printing press and a shift to printing religious material in vernacular European languages that literacy levels expanded much at all.

All this is a long, perhaps overly contextualized way of saying: scientific writing has mostly always been for and by elites. Were adventurous expeditions like Darwin’s and others written up in ways that heightened the drama and emphasized the unfamiliar aspects of new-to-Europe species and cultures? Sure! But the people taking those voyages and writing those tales were writing for their social peers. It has only been within the past 50-100 years or so that we’ve seen a more egalitarian access for a broader swathe of people to study and do science, or a broader expectation that people in public schools be taught scientific facts and traditions like scientific writing, etc. Even famous, popular science magazines like National Geographic started as elite outlets — NatGeo was founded 1888 to as a scholarly geography journal.

Now, perhaps this caveat is late, but I’m not actually a historian of science and scientific writing. (Our conversation is opening up several avenues of reading-up on this history that I now intend to do, though!) So, I’m not sure if I can tell you with certainty that there have been other periods where there has been a major push (or need) to communicate better about science. But there have definitely been previous moments in U.S. history alone where public trust in science (or the actual credibility of “science”) was comparably tenuous. Examples include centuries invested in alchemy, locking up and excommunicating Galileo for realizing the sun doesn’t orbit Earth, the introduction of and on-going fights over the theory of evolution, inflection points in [the development of various vaccines](https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/a-brief-history-of-vaccination), the bleed-over of various space tech into homes (e.g., microwaves, various chemicals, etc.) followed by backlash against nuclear weapons, corporate denial of human’s role in climate change, and so on. It seems that the history of humankind is wrought through with snake oil scams and earnest operators, and various interest groups and individual people’s motivations have long played a role in whether individuals and societies embrace and reject science-related activities and the communication that conveys these developments to the world.

The real guts of the matter, though, is that we have convincingly studied what motivates people: why we make the decisions we do, and how. And the bottom line is that no one likes to be told they are wrong or ignorant. As long as the training around science communication and scientific writing emphasizes facts over finding common ground and prioritizes a certain way of knowing over the shared goals and lived experiences of affected people, science is going to struggle to be a meaningful part of public discourse. We are all much more motivated by factors including convenience, peer pressure, and prior knowledge/experience. This is equally true for people who study science themselves. There’s a great (though sorta long) paper called “[How science makes environmental controversies worse](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1462901104000620)” that dissects how factions of marine scientists, as they disagree about some nerdy nuance of their field, actually tee up a bunch of facts that can then be cherry-picked by political interests to the detriment of marine conservation that all those scientists agree is the priority!

Maybe the short answer here is that science has always been hard to communicate, in part because we don’t always want to believe the results of scientific study. And in part because we don’t always know if we can or should. Moreover, if students don’t fully believe that what they study matters (whether it’s a course or their independent research questions), they will struggle even more so to communicate meaningfully about it. And finally, writing pedagogy itself has long been a sidelined discipline in the academy, first because the vernacular was distained by classicists and later because the study of literature was deemed more prestigious than teaching writing.

If the instruction of fundamental writing skills is devalued, it should be no surprise, then, that teaching niche writing skills like scientific writing is even less valued. These [prestige paradigms](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biae080/7815615?utm_source=authortollfreelink&utm_campaign=bioscience&utm_medium=email&guestAccessKey=032f51ec-8a60-4bcd-b7a2-eb1b8ef390e8&login=false) push writing instruction to the margins in every era and discipline. The results shouldn’t surprise us. But because they do surprise and frustrate so many people, we felt compelled to write our book and really hope it helps people shift the paradigm.

The introduction of the book is so straightforward and so clear — I knew I was reading writing by scientists, or at the very least, directed at scientists. I especially appreciate the very clear list of principles that begin the book: there are eight in total, but maybe we can start by looking closely at the first three.

1. Teaching writing is part of our jobs as scientists, particularly but not only in academia.

2. Writing should be taught throughout science curricula (in disciplinary “content” courses, not just writing courses), at all degree levels.

3. Writing is a craft, not an end product. That craft rests on a learned set of processes and skills, and thus framing writing as talent is counterproductive.

Why does it feel important to declare these principles from the start? What makes them controversial (if that’s even the word) or at least….what makes them worth stating very deliberately? [Basically I’m asking…..why do people need this book?]

First, it’s great to hear you thought the intro was straightforward and clear. We tried hard to demonstrate throughout the book that it is possible to write clearly, meaningfully, and with rigor. Put another way, we wanted to model that clarity and utility to a reader do not mean a text is not robust, intellectually sound, etc.

Next, that list in the intro started as a manifesto, literally labeled as such. I’d read someone else’s book and they ended with a manifesto, and I was inspired to do two things: (1) copy them! And (2) front-load with our manifesto, since we were writing a book that runs contrary to most traditions of “teaching” scientific writing. I figured it was important that we “warn” people of what we were going to say throughout the book. That way, if someone disagreed so vehemently with us that they wouldn’t find the book useful, they would know that at the outset. I also wanted readers to recognize from the outset that Steve and I were going to flip a bunch of counterproductive traditions on their heads, provide evidence-based advice for what to do instead, and convey all that in a writing style that would hopefully feel friendly and inviting enough that people would feel welcome to join the conversation vs. embarrassed they didn’t know what we have learned through trial, error, and some rare-to-science training I received in the humanities.

To focus on those three points you specifically noted:

A great deal of the spiral of doom in scientific writing stems from folks in the sciences touching their noses and shouting “not it” when it comes to the question of who will teach the next generation to write “properly.” Most science faculty and mentors I know do not think that English courses are sufficient for prepping students to write scientifically. (I agree.) But, most science programs I know do not have any plans or courses to fill the gap. To get past this, we have to take responsibility for learning to teach what we think our students need to know how to do. Saying so out loud is actually a pretty big deal, since the trend in STEM is mostly to say “someone (else) should fix this” when it comes to writing issues. (I may be giving a slightly too generalized impression here: there are some degree programs, institutions, and subfields that are more proactive about teaching writing. But, in the grand sweep of STEM in academia, those are exceptions, not the rule.)

Related to the first point, we can’t isolate writing instruction to a single course and expect developing scientific writers to believe us when we say they will need writing throughout their schooling and careers. Students believe us when they see us use the tools we tell them to use. But, mostly, we don’t embed writing instruction in scientific content courses the way writing is embedded in humanities courses. So, students aren’t learning that writing is thinking and intrinsic to science. They are learning that writing is the rotten task that follows the “real” work of memorizing or doing experiments or field work. Additionally, there is a misconception that only undergrads should be “subjected to” methodical teaching of essential craft skills like writing, communication, leadership, etc. Far too many science faculty I know think that graduate students are either “too cool for school” in this sense (and thus, step-by-step writing instruction would be insulting) or they think that grad students should (like they had to) just figure it out, as part of the gauntlet of joining the field. But, there is NO evidence that these attitudes efficiently help people learn to write well. So, it’s essential that we counter those attitudes and provide meaningful alternatives.

While CS readers are used to thinking of writing as a craft that is iterative, can be taught and learned/improved upon, and is easier to learn in a supportive, high-feedback-frequency environment — and they are right, all the writing instruction research supports this understanding — NONE OF THAT KNOWLEDGE is obvious, common knowledge, or common practice in scientific training environments. Moreover, most faculty and instructors have not been trained to facilitate a writing instruction environment that effectively provides this understanding to students. So, we needed to state it clearly and often in our book, and then provide readers with direct, detailed explanations of how to facilitate this kind of experience for students and mentees. To overcome these gaps, instructors and mentors must reconceptualize and reframe the work of writing and becoming a writer, for themselves and their students, respectively. I wanted our manifesto to outline this task for readers, from the outset, so that everything they read would reinforce those ideas. The alternative — having the synthesis/conclusions at the end — relies too much on readers to hold all those ideas together as they read. Again, we’re modeling effective writing as we write about how to teach it.

Can you talk a bit about the disconnect between how a student learns to write in a science class (like, say, how to write a lab report or a peer-reviewed paper) and the vast majority of writing that they’ll actually do about science? How can “authentic writing” in the classroom, as you call it, prepare them better? (I’m thinking about all the ways this applies outside of science, too — like many comp classes still work on persuasive writing in the form of, say, a newspaper editorial, when maybe it should be an Instagram caption???)

Phew. Distilling that chapter (and really, much of the book) into a response to a question here is a big task! The main difference, though, that might be of interest to CS readers is this: typical instruction approaches teach students to write as if there is one correct answer, like on a multiple choice test. That “right answer” though, is a lie. There are actually very few hard and fast rules in writing. So, what is deemed correct varies by instructor! Thus, students learn that it is impossible to get it “right.” Which is actually true and would be useful, if we taught the metacognitive side of writing along with that realization. Because we don’t, though, students instead are conditioned into a sense of futility and resentment. Professor A wants short, precise sentences with perfect punctuation and grammar. Professor B wants documents that follow a specific outline and logical flow, while also not being unreadable due to grammatical issues. Professor C cares about word choice and things like run-on sentences, whether to use an em dash or a semi-colon, etc. And none of them say more than “unclear” or “awk” when there is content or ideas in the document that they don’t think are effectively conveyed. Inevitably, students conclude they can’t get this guessing game right. And they fail to learn that sentence-level polishing is pointless if the content and ideas aren’t yet coherent. So they either stop trying or just do their very best to get it over with and hope to avoid writing in the future.

What students should be learning from authentic writing instruction is that each document/text must be calibrated to the needs of its reader. And, an effective writer knows that and knows how to make the relevant adjustments. So, rather than throwing lab reports and op-eds out the window in favor of Instagram posts, a more effective instructional approach would be to assign students to:

Select a science topic that interests them (and is relevant to the course, as necessary);

Find writing samples from several genres that address that topic: e.g., scientific paper, TikTok video, federal agency press release, community newspaper article, email).

Analyze the way the various genres deal with the topic, in terms of controversy, accuracy of facts, depth of detail, tone, word choice, length of sentences, use of sources, use of style guides, etc.

Then, identify relevant audiences/readers for 2-3 genres of interest to the student. Write their own draft texts for those audiences, using the insights from the analysis they already did.

Do self- or peer-analysis of their own writing.

Based on these analyses, identify (and perhaps complete) revisions to enhance their own drafts.

In essence, what we all need to be able to do as writers is identify who we are trying to reach, what they care about, how that aligns with what we know and care about, and then calibrate our writing precisely to those readers’ needs.

Whether we are writing a “TPS report” for Michael in a real-life version of The Office, a birthday card to a family member we are barely speaking to, a major policy brief that could address water quality issues in our hometown, or a peer-reviewed paper on particle physics, every one of us is aiming for the same levels of efficacy that we hope science-trained professionals are capable of as they make important decisions and discoveries. The reason people need this book is that teaching science students to write is no different than teaching anyone to write. We wrote this book because it’s way past time for science to acknowledge this and tap into the insights that exist about how to teach writing.

When you first told me about this book — and made a very compelling argument about why it would be of interest to the larger Culture Study audience — you argued that the book is all about bridging gaps: between instructors and mentors and a whole assortment of students who arrive in their classrooms, but also between people who just can’t seem to understand each other, in so many ways, in this moment. As a way of closing, I’d love for you to talk a bit about that more practical gap bridging, but also the more societal effects of all of us figuring out how to communicate ideas better.

Oh goody! This is my favorite soap box, because I really believe this is what matters, and it’s how we’re going to make a difference in the world, together. The honest truth here is that I am concerned about — and working to improve — scientific writing because it is both an opportunity and a long-standing hurdle to what I really work on. That is, I have spent most of my professional life not as an academic, but always working alongside or in service to science, science-trained professionals, and the application and accessibility of science to individuals and society.

I really only became an academic within the last decade, but I have spent my working life using and sharing science — as an outdoor educator, science illustrator, community journalist, science paper editor, sustainability consultant, community garden manager, and more. In that time, I’ve come to understand that most people really fear and hope for similar things. We are (almost) all worried about dying (before we’re ready) and about pain or misfortune befalling us and the people/places/beings we care about. We all hope to live comfortably, do work (paid or not) that feels meaningful, have free time for leisure and pursuits that interest us, and have genuine connections with other people. And, I will dare say, most people I know (and I’m a social catalyst type, so I interact with a lot of people) have an idea of how the world could be a better place and would really like to contribute to (if not lead) efforts to make that positive change.

I would guess most CS readers will be on board with these fundamental understandings of us as fellow humans.

Where I think the whole thing tips off the table and has the potential to shatter on impact is that there is no room for science in our society unless science-trained people understand and recalibrate for these fundamental, shared motivations. If we do not rewire science training, including what we prioritize in writing (content, style, readers, prestige), the relevance of science to society may persist, but societal recognition and embrace of that relevance will continue to decline. For context, public trust in science is declining and at all-time lows (per every Pew Research Institute study on the topic in the past 15+ years).

While many factors are at play, it is clear that the way scientists are being trained to write/communicate about their science has contributed to the current gulf of trust. The evidence and advice we share in our book humanizes not just the process of learning to/teaching to write better, but also advocates for a more personal tone in writing. This shift is supported by a lot of evidence suggesting more relational approaches to sharing science are required to bridge the public-trust gap.

In other words, this book might seem — on the surface — like a technical book about teaching and/or scientific/academic writing. But the perspectives underlying the book get at a philosophy of life that has much broader relevance to the current zeitgeist. We write extensively in our book about the necessity of mentors understanding their students are diverse and likely different from the mentor and the mentor’s life and academic experiences.

We also write extensively about how to overcome the assumed gaps between what scientists do and how and what humanities, education, and communications fields do and how, and how to leverage the insights from all of them to help people teach and learn to write more effectively about science.

All this matters because not only do we have a lonnnnng history of infighting and disciplinary prestige hierarchies in academia, but we’re seeing a more general, societal upswell in anti-intellectualism and devaluation of higher education. This is no surprise given past methods of teaching people science and scientific writing have been elitist and exclusionary. Our book calls for a vital rethinking of these training approaches, in part in hopes of countering this anti-intellectual backlash.

In essence, while we are talking about writing, we are also talking about taking a humanist, interdisciplinary approach to living life. As I noted earlier re: authentic writing assignments, the gaps we point to are symptomatic of a broader, shared reality. We all must come to understand that relevance and common ground are vital for other people to connect with what we think matters and work collectively to support policies, investments, and social systems that foster a healthy planet, etc., etc. The notion of the lone hero, whether we’re talking about mad scientists or social justice warriors, is misguided at best. This mentality that leads us to megalomaniacal, burnt-out people — and the stats point largely to women and marginalized demographics here — trying to single-handedly save the world.

But if we read any kind of history, whether it's the histories of writing pedagogy and academia or social justice movements here or abroad, what we really see is that positive social change is a long game that takes every single one of us, working together. None of us can single-handedly change how writing is taught in higher ed, let alone in science. None of us alone can counter politicized fear-mongering and shift our social priorities towards collective support.

We’re all in this together, and the sooner we understand this, the sooner we can then use [the valuable tools available to us](https://schoolofgoodtrouble.substack.com/p/books-better-than-stuff) to collectively make meaningful change in the arenas of education and society where we are called to engage. It just so happens that one of my current projects to that effect emphasizes (and hopes to facilitate) a change in how we teach scientific writing. But the motivations underpinning my work, and the lessons we can take from the case study of this niche effort, have way bigger implications for us all.
