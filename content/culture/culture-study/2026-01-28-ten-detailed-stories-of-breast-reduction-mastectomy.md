Yesterday I put a note at the top of the [Tuesday Thread](https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-to-find-new-148618379?utm_id=0f44da36-a5b4-4b98-aaf0-dd289009ce1a&utm_medium=email) about [Food For All Services](https://foodforallservices.org/) — an immigrant-run organization that delivers culturally rooted, Halal, and accessible food to Maine's immigrant and low-income communities. They're currently feeding over 300 families who can't leave their homes because of ICE surveillance (ICE isn't done with Minnesota, but it's becoming even more active in Maine) and I set a goal for us to raise $7000, which is what it costs to cover the meal and supplies needs for up to 500 families a day.

We blew past that goal. Between Venmo ([I just cashed out $9300](https://bsky.app/profile/annehelen.bsky.social/post/3mdhein3ffk2k)) and direct donations (thanks to all who forwarded me their receipts) we've raised $16,202. I am just continually in awe of this community's commitment to directing their resources to those who need them most. As I always say: it's never enough. But it's something. (As soon as the Venmo cashout hits my bank account, I'll donate and link to my receipts).

If you'd still like to contribute, donate directly [here](https://givebutter.com/Scx87A). I wish I could stop putting these sorts of whiplash-inducing asks at the top of every newsletter, but until the fuckery here changes, the asks will continue.

And before we get to the breast reductions, here's what you might have missed this past week on Culture Study:

I've tried to write with clarity and transparency about my medical experiences — [my (four) colonoscopies](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/welcome-to-your-colonoscopyagain), most vividly — but there's only so many medical experiences to which one person can testify. When I asked Culture Study readers what they'd like to hear more about, specifically when it comes to "service journalism" health and how-to topics, one subject immediately rose to the top of the request list : what it's like to get a breast reduction or mastectomy.

Dozens of CS readers also volunteered to share their stories: people who had reductions because of physical pain, people who never felt at home in a body with breasts, people with diagnoses where a mastectomy felt mandatory for survival. I could've broken these stories out into separate posts, but I wanted to make this space — including the comments — as expansive as possible, because the reasons people have for reducing or eliminating their breasts are equally expansive, and it can be bewildering to try and sort through all the Reddit posts, forums, op-eds yourself.

Below, you'll get elaborate detail. You're get differing perspectives. You'll get advice — for people who are considering a procedure, but also for people who are trying to figure out how to best care for someone you love. (And just to be clear: these testimonies are so valuable, but they cannot take the place of consulting with a medical professional you trust).

I'm so grateful for the time and care each person took in making their experience public, and I think you will be too.

The Perspectives:

ED is a 39-year-old single woman with no children who feels like a woman in her body for the first time and still gets a thrill when putting on a tank top with no bra.

JJ is a 43 year old mom of two who is thrilled to now be able to buy random bras off the rack at Target

AJM is a 60 year old mom of three who had a reduction in her 50s.

AH is 41-year-old wife, and mom of two very active boys, who had her reduction in 2023, and should have done it many many years before. She sometimes forgets to put a bra on in the summer!

PB is a 56 year old who had no boob sweat issues this summer! She is still in the process of figuring out what kind of shirts fit.

JDL is a 45-year-old breast cancer survivor who is grateful for the choices she was able to make in that constrained circumstance – and for the loved ones who supported both her choices and her recovery.

ZC is a nonbinary 39-year-old who finally feels at home in their body.

LMV is a 34-year-old parent of two (age five and 18 months) who had a gender-affirming double mastectomy in 2024. They are learning to love this beautiful new body and rejoice every day not having to put on a bra.

LTW is 37 and had top surgery in 2024

SC is a 37-year old East Asian living in an East Asian country where reductions are not the norm

People have breast reductions for SO MANY REASONS — and I’ve purposefully included people in this Q&A with a lot of different ones. What were yours?

ED: I grew up in a conservative Christian community, went to a Christian school K-12, church twice on Sundays, youth group the whole gamut. I was one of the first girls to develop and had a pretty healthy breast size by the time I was 16 (C-D cup). It got me a lot of attention from both males and females, my peers and my elders. When you are that age, you want to wear what the other girls are wearing but my breasts were larger and therefore showcased more in clothing.

Because of the attention I received from males especially (unwanted by me), I was then deemed “loose”, a “slut”, everything that purity culture fears above all else. One memorable occurrence was getting pulled into the male principal’s office, without another party present, to discuss appropriate kinds of dress, as he stared at my chest. It took me until around 30ish to deconstruct fully from Christianity and those experiences, and purity culture in general really had a negative impact on my self-image, self-esteem, sexuality etc.

As I aged, my breasts also got a little larger, and I just never felt comfortable. I had a breast reduction last year at age 38, bringing me down to B/C cup. I am thrilled with the outcome and have actually become much more free and loose with my clothing choices. Spaghetti straps! Low cut tops! No bra! I actually feel more feminine now, than I ever did before. My little 16-year-old purity culture-addled self would never believe it.

JJ: I have had disproportionately large breasts ever since the 6th grade and I hated how it impacted how I looked and my clothing choices (looking at you button-up shirts). I just always knew I wanted to do it after having kids. It only got worse once I became pregnant and breastfed. I called the doctor one month postpartum with my 2nd and last child to ask how long post-breast feeding I could get a consult and start the process. Three months was his answer and I made an appointment the first day I could within that window.

AJM: I have been self-conscious forever. On the one hand I wish I had had a reduction earlier in life (I had mine when I was 55) but on the other hand I really enjoyed breastfeeding my three children — there is a utility to the things, after all!

PB: I had my breast reduction in January 2025 at age 55. I was a J cup. I had divots in my shoulders from my bra straps that were becoming permanent. I needed a sports bra to go for a walk. It was an ongoing/year-round challenge to manage boob sweat (I was getting rashes). I had been seeing a chiropractor, physical therapist, and massage therapist over the years to address back and neck pain. So, my primary motivation was to address back pain, but, not gonna lie, I was also tired of having to order bras and swimsuits from England and only pick out cardigan sweaters with zipper fronts, or the general “matronly” vibe I was giving.

JDL: I was diagnosed with breast cancer in my right breast at age 42, and the process moved very quickly: just a week and a half after my biopsy, I met with the three members of my oncological team (surgical; radiation; medical) to discuss my treatment plan. I went into that meeting with a fairly strong sense of how I would proceed: my tumor was large and multifocal, and I knew that I didn’t want to spend the rest of my (hopefully very long!) life regularly getting imaging to guard against the cancer returning in my breasts.

My medical oncologist did present the possibility of a lumpectomy (aka partial mastectomy) but was clear that a mastectomy was the safest option for me. After the surgery, the size of the tumor—5 cm!—and its closeness to my chest wall confirmed this choice. I also knew that if I was going to remove one breast, I was going to remove both. The decision to have a double (or bilateral) mastectomy ultimately felt very easy–and far easier than the question of what I wanted my breasts to be post-surgery.

Some backstory: I had a complicated relationship with my breasts in my teens. They seemed to appear overnight, and they were big enough that they garnered plenty of unwanted attention–especially since the Victoria’s Secret bras of my youth didn’t actually fit me. But then I got a professional bra fitting in my 20s; learned that DD is not, in fact, the largest size available; and came to love my properly-wrangled 30Gs. So when my surgical oncologist suggested that we could simply do implants and keep everything essentially the same–breasts but no cancer!--I was on board. She referred me to a plastic surgeon, with the idea that I would have a single incision under each breast; preserve the skin, nipple, and areola; and replace my breast tissue with an implant (this isn’t what I actually did! See next Q for continuation of this story…)

ZC: I came out as nonbinary when I was 35 (a late bloomer). I've never felt comfortable with my breasts. I always thought it was because I developed early, but I never got over my discomfort (both emotional and physical) with the alien tissue sacs puberty had grafted onto my chest. Once I found out it was possible to get a mastectomy for gender reasons even without identifying as a man, I found it harder and harder to ignore how much I disliked having breasts. After a couple of years agonizing over the decision and weighing the pros and cons of such a drastic change, I decided I wanted to go into the second half of my life in a body that felt comfortable to me.

LMV: I am an AFAB (assigned female at birth) genderqueer person and have had dysphoria around my chest since first going through puberty. As young as 8 or 9, I remember wishing I’d have breast cancer when I grew up so I wouldn’t have to have breasts. I couldn’t imagine any other future reality to escape having an adult female body, and it brought me an incredible amount of distress. This gender dysphoria contributed to years of depression and suicidality. The birth of my first child made me realize I didn’t want to live my life as anyone but my true self. I came out to my wife and friends as trans in 2021 and eventually realized I could do something about hating my chest! I had a double incision mastectomy/chest masculinization with no nipple grafts in October 2024, which I’m happy to say gives me gender euphoria.

LTW: I very vividly remember laying in bed reading at some point with my 34HH tits feeling like they were mounded all the way to my chin and thinking “If I am on my deathbed and I am still being smothered by my tits, I am going to be SO ANNOYED.” Which is about when I started thinking that surgery might be the right option for me. During the process, I discovered that I also have a genetic predisposition for breast cancer (not BRCA), but that was well after I started the process through the gender affirming care route.

I briefly toyed with the idea of doing a radical reduction over fully flat top surgery, but I really liked the idea of running without having to wear two sports bras and reading enough people’s accounts of having their chest increase in size post-surgery really clinched the totally flat option for me. Which ended up being great that I landed there on my own because the cancer predisposition would have required taking all of my breast tissue anyway. Technically, I identify as agender (in the sense that I don’t have an internal sense of gender but understand gender as a social construct and something that is important to other people), so it always feels a little disingenuous to say I got gender affirming top surgery when really I got it for sensory reasons, but that is what my paperwork says. I had a single incision mastectomy with chest masculinization and nipple grafts, plus bilateral lymph node removal.

SC: There wasn’t one day where I didn’t think about my breasts. I was in constant pain, and they were always in the way (for me and others). I had to alter all my clothes, I had to buy specialized swimsuits and bras and ship them into my country, I couldn’t see the stairs, I couldn’t run or have a full range of motion for any exercises near and around my chest, the list goes on and on. I live in a highly populated city with limited personal space, and would get run into a lot because no one would expect my breasts to be that far away from my body.

What messaging, hesitation, family pressure, or internal roadblocks did you run into as you started to consider the process? How did you process them?

ED: The only hesitation I received were from a couple friends/family members that had small chests and could not believe that I’d electively want to make mine smaller. They were well intentioned but it just goes to show, we really mostly want what we don’t have.

AJM: Really, none. After a lifetime of self-consciousness I honestly just woke up one day and decided “I’m going to have breast-reduction surgery!” I think all my hesitation was prior to making the decision.

PB: I really wrestled with the idea of breast reduction as vanity. There were two realizations that helped me process the self-judgment: first, that I was saying no to certain outdoor activities because of breast bounce concerns/discomfort–that was a bad reason to say no. And second, that if I did have surgery now (at 55), I would still have 20+ years of feeling better and being more active. I had one friend who was really a trusted sounding board as I processed some of these feelings. I didn’t want to mention it to family (including my husband) until I had decided it was something I wanted to pursue.

JDL: My plastic surgeon is wonderful, but it was after that appointment that I had my first post-diagnosis breakdown. I remember sitting in the office, holding an implant in my hand, and not feeling right: I knew that I wanted to do everything in a single surgery, but the reality of the single incision would be that my breasts would be roughly the same size post-surgery. The implants just felt too big for me, and I realized that I had to come to terms with the fact that my body actually wouldn’t be the same post surgery, whether my breasts were the size they had always been or not. I did a lot of research at that point, trying to get a sense of the various options, from aesthetic flat to various forms of reconstruction.

Ultimately, my mom discovered a relatively new procedure called a SWIM flap reconstruction, which is essentially a Goldilocks mastectomy (picture a scar shaped like an anchor: a line down from the nipple and then a curve under the breast) in which all breast tissue is removed, the nipple is preserved, and the skin on the lower half of the breast is folded in to make a small breast mound. I scheduled another appointment with my plastic surgeon, essentially pitched her on this procedure, and she agreed. I felt very grateful to have this level of choice and decision-making power, given the many constraints associated with my diagnosis (and all of the decisions and appointments happened in the course of a month — and over the Christmas holidays! — so it really was a whirlwind).

I had initially liked the idea of just a single incision to prevent extensive (and visible) scarring–but I also have an incredible best friend who had a breast reduction 20 years earlier. She showed me her scars as I was thinking through the various possibilities–and they looked great! I was also very nervous about whether my nipples would survive the procedure, and whether I would have sensation in my breasts: they did, and I do–though not the same level of sensation that I had before (those nerves have been through a lot!).

Everyone in my life was super supportive throughout this process–it was really about me grappling with my own relationship to my breasts, to my (formerly very healthy) body, and to what it meant to have a cancer diagnosis at a relatively young age.

ZC: My discomfort with my breasts had been such an ordinary background part of my life for so long (more than two decades by the time I started considering surgery) that it took me a long time to really see how bad it was. I also felt guilty for considering putting myself out of commission with a young child and signing my husband up for weeks of solo parenting plus post-surgery caretaking. In retrospect, I was dealing with a lot of impostor syndrome, as well as fear of going through a major surgery. In the moment, it felt more like I was being greedy and selfish for thinking of putting my family through the financial and logistical burdens of surgery and recovery when my chest dysphoria wasn't really that big a deal. (Except it really was.)

LMV: Being trans or even queer was not an option for me as a kid in a religious family. There are several decades of complicated and painful history I won’t get into here, but the result is that, even after coming out as queer in 2016, getting married, and making a life with my wife and our baby, I still hated myself and thought I would always hate myself. I’d always known I wasn’t a girl, but I didn’t really know who/what I was. It wasn’t until I was in my late twenties that I saw someone femme-presenting share about their top surgery that I realized it was something I could pursue. Like ZC, I thought you had to “fully transition,” ie, live as a trans man to have top surgery. I didn’t know that nonbinary and genderqueer people could pursue it too. Initially, I had to dismantle a mountain of internalized transphobia from my religious upbringing, and then my personal understanding of what it meant to be trans needed to expand.

LTW: I saved myself a lot of family opinions by just….not telling them at all until quite late in the process and then just letting them think that it was purely for cancer prevention reasons. My family is relatively supportive of queer issues in general, but really struggles when understanding how it applies to my life in specific and given that I don’t need them to affirm my gender, it frankly didn’t feel worth the hassle to get everyone on the same page. I am blessed with a lot of trans friends and so have had a lot of modeling of bodily autonomy, plus a lot of practice thinking through the practicalities of embodiment.

My only real struggle was in finding a framework to understand my desire since I was right in thinking that top surgery wasn’t going to particularly change how I relate to my own gender. But shout out to [Kate Leth](https://www.tiktok.com/@katelethargy?lang=en) who did a phenomenal series of TikToks on their top surgery journey that opened up a whole world of possibilities. My relationship with my body is still weird for about 100 different reasons! Having surgery didn’t solve that! But I am 80% less annoyed with how shirts fit, so we’ll take the win.

SC: I live in a country where reductions are extremely rare. If a surgeon does breast surgery, it’s usually a mastectomy or reconstructive surgery. Finding the right plastic surgeon took lots of research, in the country I live in and other countries.

Years ago, I was looking for health insurance. When I asked about reductions, the agent laughed openly at me. I hung up, embarrassed. I didn’t want to think about reductions for a long time after that. Once I made enough money, I decided the search was on again. I interviewed multiple surgeons, got scoffed at for asking if a certain surgeon offered reductions, and got ghosted by a reputable plastic surgery hospital in another country.

The worst interview was with a male surgeon who asked me why I wasn’t having children and then quoted me over $32,000USD. When I asked to see some previous examples, he showed me a woman with an enormous, heavy scar down her front. This was a man who didn’t care about how his patient would feel about her body later.

I decided on having surgery in my own country though the upfront cost was more than doing it in another country more known for plastic surgery tourism. My surgeon is a reputable plastic surgeon who was the only woman in her graduating class. And while I was quoted more, she included a lot more for free.

Because this is a public service post, we’re going to get into the nitty gritty as much as we can. How did you get the gears going to get the procedure approved (by insurance) and/or paid for? What complications would you tell people to anticipate?

ED: I am an OR nurse and have plastic surgery experience at both a large teaching hospital and at a private facility. I opted to have my surgery performed by one of the doctors at the private facility, as I had firsthand knowledge of his skill set and had seen his really great outcomes. On a side note, my breast size would have not qualified me for insurance coverage so I was going to be cash pay either way. But speaking from the perspective of a plastic surgery OR nurse, a lot of plastic surgeons don’t take insurance so if one would like to pursue insurance coverage, anticipate a potentially long wait time for an appointment and/or surgery since the pool is smaller. For example, my private facility technically did take insurance, the doctors just opted to not to take breast reduction insurance cases since the reimbursement was so terrible from insurance companies that it wasn’t worth their time from an operational standpoint.

If you opt for insurance coverage, just know that any potential future revisions needed will most likely not be covered by insurance. Most plastic surgery requires some kind of revision (it’s literally why it’s called “plastic” surgery, for the word “plasticity”). Most docs will do as much revision under local anesthesia in office, however if it’s a larger revision that needs general anesthesia, anticipate that you’d have to pay minimally OR and anesthesia fees for the revision and perhaps a surgeon's fee.

JJ: It was surprisingly easy to get approved. I called and made an appointment with a plastic surgeon who a friend has used and was very pleased with the same procedure, (Sidenote: I was not prepared that the vibe at a plastic surgeon's office is VERY different than a normal doctor's office. They were obviously very professional, but all the staff and nurses were dressed up and looking gorgeous). The plastic surgeon asked if I had gone to the chiropractor or if my PCP had noted in my chart previous years complaining of back pain (those are two things to do if you are thinking of seeking one in the future).

He took many measurements and photos and explained that in order to get insurance coverage one pound from each side needed to be removed; since I was at a J, he could take me to a C/D depending on how much was excess skin and how much was fat. Even without me having notes in my chart with previous providers about back pain, my insurance company pre-authorized it with no issue. (This was ten years ago so that landscape could have changed.)

My goal was to get scheduled by December of that year as I had already met my deductible with childbirth. I was surprised when they could squeeze me in October, which was about a month about insurance approved it. The main complication was that someone mistyped how much weight they removed during surgery in my chart and it was below the one-pound-per-breast required by insurance for coverage. So all the claims were rejected and it was a tense couple of days looking at a massive bill before that was figured out.

AJM: I didn’t try to get approved. Honestly it didn’t strike me as medically necessary and since I could afford it I just did self-pay.

PB: I told my PCP that I would consider self-pay, but wanted to see if insurance would cover it (February). She gave me a referral and that doctor was not booking appointments, so I took the next available appointment in the practice which was 4 months out (May). The doctor took all kinds of measurements and photos of my naked chest. [BTW, I specifically told the doctor I did not want my photographs to be published anywhere.] Then she made the case to the insurance company. It took about 6-8 weeks, but it was approved (in July) and I was told that the surgery could be conducted between October and December. One problem: the doctor didn't have any surgery appointments until January. The surgeon was able to get the insurance company to update the dates.

I had a very last minute scare that the surgery would need to be delayed because it would be over one year since my last mammogram, but I was able to convince the surgeon (it was literally only a week over). Long story, but the surgeon is the key to getting approval. I provided her with copies of my chiropractor and massage statements with the diagnosis codes as support.

JDL: Mastectomies and reconstruction are covered by insurance because of the [Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Act](https://www.cms.gov/cciio/programs-and-initiatives/other-insurance-protections/whcra_factsheet) — and this includes follow-up procedures (if, in the future, I wanted implants, for example). I was diagnosed in December 2022, in the wake of the overturning of Roe, so I was both grateful to learn this and livid that breasts are treated as more worthy of protection than reproductive rights.

ZC: My husband and I had an unexpected financial windfall that would have made it possible for us to pay for the surgery entirely out of pocket, which is when I really started letting myself consider it as an option. After digging deep into the details of my insurance policy (which was an ordeal, involved hours scouring Google and the insurance company's website, and definitely did not involve someone else impersonating me on the phone with my consent), I discovered, to my surprise, that my insurance would cover the surgery even though I didn't identify as male. All that was necessary was a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (which I already had due to a stint in therapy to help figure out my identity a few years prior) and a letter from a therapist confirming that the surgery was medically necessary. I reached out to my former therapist, who was happy to write me a letter.

There was a fee of a couple hundred dollars, but that felt very doable compared to the out-of-pocket cost of the surgery. In the end, my success with my insurance was mixed--they would cover the mastectomy itself, but not the liposuction that was part of the chest contouring process, because they classified that as cosmetic. I considered fighting it, but in the end I chose to pay the uncovered portion out-of-pocket because I didn't feel cut out for a long and involved battle with insurance while also prepping for a major surgery. I paid about $4000 out-of-pocket in total.

LMV: I first consulted Reddit to find out which surgeons in my area were considered the best. I had seen images online of less-than-ideal aesthetic outcomes, so I was willing to wait to get in with my region’s most highly regarded surgeon. Someone online referred to her as “a god,” and I don’t disagree. I work for a large company with comprehensive trans healthcare coverage, so I knew my surgery would be almost fully covered. The final bill to my insurance was around $60k, and I ended up paying around $1800 out of pocket.

After grad school, I had researched companies’ health coverage and only applied to places where I knew top surgery would be covered. Getting a job at one of these companies was the main hurdle to finally pursuing surgery once I knew I wanted it. It varies by state, but you need some kind of letter from a therapist documenting gender dysphoria before surgery will be covered; testosterone is not a prerequisite for top surgery. Requirements may shift as trans healthcare access becomes more limited in the U.S.

LTW: I spent a very long time lurking on the top surgery subreddits until I found people describing a newer procedure that had the kinds of results I was looking for. I would have traded off the loss of nipple sensation, but when people started describing their experiences with a new surgeon in the area who did nerve reinnervation, it was enough to push me over into starting the process. My end-to-end process ended up taking almost a full year, even though I was quoted about three months initially: my surgeon’s office was an absolute clown show, there were detours into genetic counseling, and I ended up having to coordinate two surgeons’ schedules to account for the preventative mastectomy piece.

I work at a big company where many, many people have had range of gender affirming care covered, the insurance piece was actually the easiest part of it. I ended up paying about $1500 out of pocket for everything up to the surgery. I weirdly had less covered in for my postsurgery follow-up appointments for reasons I could never quite divine, but even that only came out to about $500 all in, so I’m hardly going to complain about it.

But dealing with my two surgeons' offices, even though they had worked together before, was an absolute nightmare in scheduling and coordination that was a true test of my paperwork anxiety. I had to call the office multiple times to get through to anyone, had to stop an appointment in the middle because it was clear that my surgeon was working off the wrong chart (there was another patient with the same name as me); I regularly waited two hours past appointment times to be seen, had the surgeon’s office schedule me at the wrong hospital that was across town from where the surgeon actually was on that day, and was left sitting topless waiting for someone to come change bandages and bolsters at my first post op appointment for 90 minutes. I don’t know that I actually would have been able to navigate the process when I was younger.

How did you prepare for the procedure? What did it feel like — and what was recovery like? What would you have done differently, if anything?

ED: Again, I had the advantage of actually doing this for a living so I was well-versed in what recovery would be like. I didn’t require narcotics and could get away with Tylenol and Ibuprofen for discomfort. I also moved around a lot (without deviating from the lifting restrictions). Movement after surgery, like gentle walking, is so good for you: it helps with circulation, which helps with healing and inflammation management, prevents blood clots etc. From my professional experience, most folks who have breast reductions don’t experience a lot of pain as it’s mostly pertaining to soft tissue. It’s when muscle is involved that things tend to be more painful.

I was also psychologically prepared as I had so much professional experience. Another person here wrote about they didn’t process that plastic surgery is real surgery — THIS IS SO COMMON! We saw this ALL THE TIME at our practice. It’s real surgery: one that will require downtime, one will feel pain/discomfort, one’s activity will be restricted for a certain period of time. There will be incisions to take care of and you will need to sleep on your back for at least eight weeks and whoa baby, for the side and stomach sleepers out there this is the absolute worst part.

JJ: My mom came in town to help with my eight-month-old as I could not lift him right away....but honestly, with how good I felt, I could have been okay without that assistance. My surgery was in an outpatient center. I was not prepared to have the doctor come in before surgery with a ruler and marker in front of my husband and mom to mark me up with a look on his face like he was solving a very complex problem. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciated his focus and precision, but could have gone through that humiliation on my own without an audience.

Recovery was a breeze. I did have drains but they were not an issue and came out quickly. I had the procedure done on a Wednesday and felt like I could have returned to work (office type job) on that Friday for a half day. I did not take pain medication other than Tylenol/Advil. I did return to work on that Monday with no issues. Getting the stitches out was pretty painful — I thought I could just pop in during my lunch hour and it was likely the most uncomfortable part of the entire process.

After reading about others' recovery experiences, I did some reflection about why mine felt so easy: I was younger at the time (32) and was 8 months postpartum. Pregnancy/childbirth were really hard on me so it is also possible that I view the recovery the way I do because I was comparing it to a c-section....or maybe it felt easy because I was young and could bounce back more quickly.

(I also concur to go smaller than you think you should. My breasts also grew back in perimenopause. I was a J, went to a C, and ten years later I'm back to a DD. I have no idea if you can do the procedure twice but that thought has crossed my mind as I loved them smaller).

AJM: OK so here is where I have a public service message. This may be obvious, but I was so clueless, as this was my first surgery. When they said “plastic surgery” I didn’t process that it is surgery and SURGERY IS A BIG DEAL. The doctors tried to tell me, but I didn’t listen. I didn’t take time off from work, I didn’t want to tell my company. (I work remotely). I should have. I also didn’t follow the no-exercise rule and went for walks. As a result, I got a hematoma (internal bleeding). In retrospect, I should have taken the surgery much more seriously.

My other “lesson learned” is significant. GO FOR A BIGGER REDUCTION THAN YOU THINK YOU WANT/THE DOCTORS SUGGEST. If you want to be a C, get a B. If you want to be an A, get a B. THEY GROW BACK OVER TIME. Life is long. I was a C after surgery, and ~8 years later I’m a DD.

PB: I took a week off work and took the painkillers and watched lots of movies. Friends and family came over and brought me lunch and took slow walks around the block with me. I had a soft work schedule for the following two weeks (worked from home, deferred things if possible). My husband had to help me wash my hair (no showers for a week, and no lifting hands above shoulders). I slept the first few nights in a recliner. I was surprised how tired I was for about three months after the surgery. I did not have energy/bandwidth for anything creative. Beforehand I moved things I would need to lower places (again, no reaching above shoulders) and stockpiled tops that opened in the front. I was worried about scarring (based on my c-section scar experience) and so since the incisions healed, I have been using scar cream.

JDL: There’s so much to say here! Preparation falls into two buckets: the logistics / administrative and the emotional.

Logistics: I’m happily single and live alone, which means thinking carefully about a major surgery and the support structures needed (I’m also lucky to have an incredible community of friends and family!). I had friends with me at every doctor’s appointment, so I could truly listen/engage/ask questions while they took detailed notes. Three of my dearest friends took point and we had a planning meeting (the “Pre-Surgery Summit!”) to work out the details, which ultimately included a “Post-Surgery Care Chart” that detailed who would be with me, when, and what needed to happen (ie: laundry, appointments, etc.). A colleague and friend arranged a Meal Train for me, and many people contributed, which meant I didn’t need to worry about cooking in the early weeks post-surgery. My godmother (a former nurse) came to stay with me for the surgery and the first few days at home; she checked my bandages and reassured me that everything looked okay (and that I was managing my drains well!).

I spoke with friends of friends who had mastectomies before my surgery, and they were helpful both in talking through the different options (implants or no) and in recommending material comforts. I purchased a post-mastectomy pillow that straps onto your body (for wearing in the car to cushion the seat belt strap, and for wearing when you sleep); a wedge pillow to sleep on, which kept me elevated and the drains draining; a zip-up hoodie with interior pockets to hold the drains; etc.

Emotional: Do things that bring you joy. I love to host and bring people together, so I threw myself a “New Year, New Boobs” party on New Year’s Eve, with lots of good-luck foods. My friends were also incredible here: one booked me a massage on the day before my surgery. Two went on a pre-surgery weekend trip with me. Another sent me boob-themed mug and “Tits the Season!” ornament that I still hang on my tree.

And consider, as well, what will enable the best recovery: my mom wanted to be the one to stay with me after my surgery, and I talked her into having my godmother (her best friend) stay with me instead. I love my mom, but I knew that I would feel responsible for her emotional wellbeing at a time when I really needed to focus on my own. This was definitely the right choice for me, as difficult as it was to tell my mom no in the moment!

Recovery went smoothly, all things considered, but wow: drains are not fun. I also struggled with the fact that recovery wasn’t wholly linear: it’s not a straight upward trajectory, and I definitely had peaks and valleys. Having a clearer sense of that in advance likely would have helped!

I definitely would have preferred not to get cancer, but I feel very good about the choices I made in response to that shitty situation. If I could go back in time, I would do the same surgery again, and I truly enjoy the experience of having very small breasts–the backless dresses! The ease of working out! The lack of both physical and social discomfort!

ZC: I spent a long time on Reddit reading other people's advice and recovery experiences. I stocked up on recommended post-surgery supplies, some of which were lifesaving (a reacher to pick stuff up off the floor for when my movements were severely restricted) and some of which I barely used (the mastectomy pillow, which looked so soft and comfy but turned out to push my arms up away from my torso in a painful way). I set up a table next to my recliner with everything I needed within arm's reach. I took a trip to Walmart to stock up on cheap button-down shirts, since I knew I wouldn't be able to raise my arms above my head to pull on my usual t-shirts for several weeks.

The most important thing I did was take plenty of time to rest after surgery — I basically did nothing but eat, sleep, and read for the first three weeks, and didn't drive again until I felt comfortable behind the wheel, which took about six weeks. (I was physically capable of driving much earlier, but my mental reaction times just weren’t there yet. Don’t underestimate the mental effects of surgery! Your body will be focusing all its efforts on healing, and your brain gets whatever is left over.) The main thing I wish I had done differently is not compare my recovery process to the people I saw online who were mainly in their late teens or early twenties. It felt disheartening to be having significant fatigue two months out and read updates from people who were back at the gym at six weeks, but I was two decades older — of course my experience was going to be different.

LMV: The wait to even get in for an initial consult with my surgeon was ten months. After that, it was another 14 months until surgery, so I had quite a while to prepare. (That long a wait between consult and surgery isn’t typical, but we were trying to time it right with my wife’s second pregnancy and birth.) Most of that preparation involved unpacking my fears about the surgery with my therapist. My mom had died in an emergency surgery eight years prior, so I was terrified of going under anesthesia and was convinced I was going to die on the operating table. Waking up after surgery might be the most euphoric, emotional moment of my life — it felt like waking from the dead. I still touch my chest several times a day and can’t believe something so beautiful and life-giving happened to me.

It was immensely difficult timing to have a major surgery with a six-month-old baby that I couldn’t pick up or help care for for six weeks. I was in a lot of pain and discomfort and had limited movement. The drains and ON-Q pain pump were itchy and awkward to maneuver around. My wife was an incredible support, but her hands were full with our baby and preschooler most of the time, so I felt a little isolated in the weeks after surgery. I wish I had taken more than two weeks off work. I ended up slipping into a pretty bad depression after I did go back because it was so much stress to handle physical recovery, my job, and two young kids. Unfortunately, I only qualified for two weeks of paid disability since I’d been at my job less than two years.

LTW: The thing that was hardest to navigate was figuring out how to handle post op as I am single and live alone. I could have asked my family, but that would have been infinitely more stressful having them in my tiny apartment for an extended period than just figuring out how to do it myself . Luckily, once I got into planning actual surgery logistics my best friend offered to come in from out of state to take care of me, which I was totally floored by. I hadn’t even thought to ask because she had plenty going on in her own life and figuring out how to do it on my own, while not ideal, was feasible. Having her offer what I wouldn’t have even thought to ask for has fundamentally introduced a new tenet to my life which is: If You Are Willing To Do Something For Someone, Offer Because They May Not Ask. I didn’t want to be a burden! But what is life but the gift of getting a charge from helping other people and letting other people get that charge from helping you back and forth forever.

I was scared of being in pain (because I don’t tolerate painkillers well) and freaked out by the logistical reality of drains (because they seemed gross), neither of which ended up being a big deal at all. The only time I ended up needing more painkillers was right after I woke up from surgery in the recovery room. Other than that, my pain was well managed by Gabapentin and alternating doses of Tylenol and Advil. My drains were nowhere near the horror stories that I had read on Reddit and were honestly less gross than other bodily fluids most people have to deal with on a more regular basis. Most Reddit comments skew towards people who are having either really positive or really negative experiences. Most people aren’t leaving comments if they are having recoveries that more or less go according to plan!

So maybe the real lesson here is pay more attention to your surgeon and their advice than Reddit (although frankly even with the obvious skews in perspective, Reddit can be incredibly helpful at different points in the process). The two worst parts of the experience were 1.) the taxi ride home which took two hours even though it normally only takes 45 minutes and 2.) the glorping and glugging internal sensation every time I moved while I still had the post-surgical binder on. Hideous.

The only real supplies I ended up using were a pregnancy pillow (I was a side sleeper and was worried about not being able to sleep, but the process actually mostly turned me into a back sleeper) and a long phone charging cable. Supplies lists are fun but not actually that necessary. In the end, my friend and I spent a week watching the Special Olympics and niche, craft-based reality TV shows and taking ever-increasing slow walks. After she left, I spent another week OOO, another month working remotely and about two months of fatigue. By the three month mark I was back to full activities. Being fairly active and strong helped a lot with early recovery (especially not needing my arms to get up), but I wish I had scheduled post-surgical PT sooner, even though my surgeon didn’t specifically recommend it. Relearning how my torso is supposed to work after removing all of that mass I had been working around for so long is a constantly ongoing process.

SC: One thing I didn’t anticipate was how I reacted to anesthesia. I ended up needing to take further time off work because I came back and had memory issues. My surgeon warned me that East Asians have a higher risk of hypertrophic scarring and showed me some examples of what it could look like. She was right, and I do have lots of scarring. This normally wouldn’t bother me, but you can see exactly where my new areolas are unless I’m wearing a dreaded padded bra.

How did you deal with telling — or not telling — other people about your reduction? What do people get hung up on — and how do you handle those most annoying questions? What part of talking about your experience feels good, and what part still feels uncomfortable?

ED: I really didn’t have any hang ups but I think that mostly stems from being a nurse for 18 years and having seen A LOT of bodies in various states over that time. A body is just a body is just a body. Just because it was breasts didn’t matter. I also had the surgery performed where I work, so naturally everyone knew it was happening.

JJ: I did not tell many people and wore a lot of blazers/jackets and bulkier shirts, especially when I had to wear a sports bra during recovery. I would not recommend doing it in the summer if people-not-noticing is important to you. So many people just thought I lost weight (which I guess I did) and some made comments about that, but if they noticed, I did not hear about it. It has been ten years now so I am very comfortable talking about it.

AJM: I told friends and family. I never told my work colleagues (since again I work remotely). I did not have any issues about telling people and I didn’t find their reactions annoying. I was very open about it and I think people respected it.

AH: I work in a high school teaching ELA, and I had my surgery leading up to our spring break. I KNEW when I came back after two weeks I would look different. I was teaching seniors at the time — they don’t hold back! I just told them I was having surgery to correct a problem, that I was not sick, and would be back in two weeks. When I came bac, I was still so swollen, but it wasn’t SUPER noticeable. I told very few colleagues. I couldn’t lift my arms over my head when I went back to work, so I asked the tallest kids to erase the board for me if I needed help.

By contrast, I was shouting the news to every single friend I had; they all knew how long I’d been waiting to get it. I told my parents and in laws…. and let them spread the word (they like to tellllll people things, lol)

PB: I think in the absence of information, people can come to the wrong idea and I didn’t want people at work to think I was having surgery because I was sick. I was matter of fact with coworkers; some people got more details on the why. I did tell friends and family but I had a rehearsed response if anyone seemed like they were going to question my decision (no one did).

JDL: I tried to be open about my diagnosis and the steps I would need to take to address it, both in my personal life and in my professional life. My surgeons suggested a full six-week recovery time from the mastectomy (before we knew with certainty the extent of chemo/radiation that might follow from the surgery), so I took FMLA/short-term disability from my job as a professor. Given the nature of one of my roles as director of an honors program, I also had to decide how much to share with students about my reasons for taking a leave. I often work with students who have to navigate big, complicated life stuff, and I tell them how important it is to prioritize their physical and mental well-being–so I tried to model that explicitly by communicating that I was taking a leave because of a cancer diagnosis and need for surgery (without getting into specifics).

I’ve since written about my diagnosis and my mastectomy in an op-ed on the importance of mammograms, and I feel very comfortable talking/writing about it. The experience itself was traumatic (in ways I am only now – three years later! — coming to fully recognize), but communicating it is a way of processing some of those difficult feelings and (ideally!) helping others in similar circumstances. I benefited so much from the people who shared their experiences with mastectomies and reductions with me in advance of my surgery, and I’m grateful for opportunities (like this one!) to offer that support to others.

ZC: I had an incredibly awkward experience where I told my family and then, after receiving a huge outpouring of misdirected support, had to explain that I didn't have cancer! But I was lucky in that everyone I told was incredibly supportive. I was worried that people would try to convince me it wasn't really necessary or wasn't worth the risks, but this never happened. As for the acquaintances I wasn't close enough with to tell ahead of time, either they haven't noticed or just feel too awkward to ask — I'm betting on the second, because my chest was not small! If anyone gets weird about it, I plan to tell them the New England winters are so cold that they literally froze off.

LMV: I did not come out to my family of origin as trans until three weeks before my top surgery, though I’d been out with my wife, friends, and workplace for four years, and everyone else close to me knew about the surgery. Coming out as queer nearly a decade prior had gone so poorly that I was afraid to revisit that particular kind of rejection. My sister works in post-op care for mastectomy patients, so she is well-versed in the risks and recovery process for this procedure. You’d think that would make her a great support person, right? In reality, she sent me a long email detailing all the risks and possible complications two weeks before my surgery to try to convince me not to do it. My dad, who is actually supportive of my queer identity, also disapproved and told me surgery was a mistake. I think their disapproval stemmed from fear and thinking I would regret permanently altering my body. I told them the alternative, for me, was a life of continued self-loathing, depression, and never feeling at home with myself. They haven’t broached the topic with me since. To their credit, they both did stop by to visit me in the weeks following surgery.

LTW: I mostly don’t talk about it at work, except with people that I am already friends with, but that’s largely because I tend to be pretty private at work anyway. With friends, I’m pretty open about referencing it, but tend not to go into details unless someone has specific questions, which really hasn’t happened much. I've found that many people — particularly my family and women of my mother’s generation — want this surgery to have Been A Whole Thing for me, but it really wasn’t in the way that they would recognize. Everyone wants more of an emotional journey, and once they realize that I wasn’t going to give them that, most people lose interest. My tits were a huge part of what stood out about me to other people, but they weren’t a major part of my self-conception, so there’s a little bit of a strange mismatch of expectations there.

SC: While I lost four cup sizes and would recommend reduction to anyone who wants it, I have some unresolved feelings. Even writing this out took a long time because I didn’t know what to say.

I’m now an E and still feel too big. This is after a second surgery (liposuction) and waiting over a year for things to settle. I don’t plan on having another surgery since I don’t want to be under anesthesia unless absolutely necessary, and I don’t want to go through more scarring. I wish I had heard more from woman who didn’t get the size they wanted so I could have processed that earlier. Most people can’t understand that someone East Asian would need a reduction, so I don’t really discuss it.

If someone’s loved one is about to have a reduction, what specific things can they do to help?

AH: I found the most helpful thing was having someone close by in the first few days to help with managing the day-to-day of my household. My husband handled the kids before and after school the first few days, but my mom stopped over, did the dishes, folded the laundry, and got me ice packs.

ZC: If you will be taking care of someone who is getting surgery, be prepared to be on call for the first few days, including for awkward things. Arm movement is severely limited in the early recovery period, and it turns out we use our arms for a lot of things! For several days after my surgery, I couldn't pull up my own pants, which led to some sheepish texts from the bathroom. It took a couple of weeks before I could shower unassisted. I needed help getting into bed at night and getting up in the morning, and help wrapping myself in the compression wrap I had to wear for several weeks after the surgery.

Do what you can to limit your other responsibilities ahead of time and take extra-good care of yourself in the moment, because you'll be doing a lot. Also, if someone you know has gotten a mastectomy for gender reasons, compliment the results! A lot of us feel insecure about our results at first, especially in the early stages of the healing process when everything is swollen and weird-looking, and a reassuring compliment can go a long way.

LMV: For gender-affirming mastectomies specifically, I think it’s important to treat the surgery like the celebratory, life-giving event that it is. A lot of my (cis and straight) friends seemed hesitant around me, acting as if something bad had happened, like I was recovering from an accident or something. Recovery is painful and difficult, yes, but trans folks want to hear about how great their flat chests look, that you’re proud of them, that they are brave for choosing to live more fully as themselves—at least, that’s what I wanted to hear. They might not have many people in their lives supporting their choice to have surgery, so give them all the encouragement and affirmation you can.

LTW: For primary caregivers, being on top of what the specific instructions are from their surgeon and keeping track of pain management schedules helped me stay ahead of my pain, especially in the first few days that I spent a lot of time sleeping and not being super cognizant of time. My surgeon had comparatively few movement restrictions for me, but having my friend around to point out when I was about to do something very silly like lifting multiple plates above shoulder height because I wasn’t paying attention was helpful. I ended up needing less help with care tasks and bandage changing than I thought I would, but even just knowing that there was someone around I could yell for if I got stuck was a load off my mind. For everyone outside of that immediate, hands on care: food delivery gift cards and media recommendations are honestly the most useful.

This one’s hokey but I feel like it’s always a good way of generating some sincere advice. What message would you like to give your pre-procedure self? What do you wish you had known about the surgery before you had it?

ED: This is my primary advice as a plastic surgery nurse (for all plastics procedures, not just reductions): It takes at least a year for things to truly settle out. Sometimes longer. One nipple may be higher than the other and you’ll think “what the fuck did I do” and then the tissue relaxes and the nipple comes down. One part of the incision is still pink and angry looking six months in. Suddenly it’s not. Ride the wave and see what it all shakes out to. One may need a revision, I always say the 9-12 month mark is the right length of time to wait to see how it all settles and then decide to revise or not.

JJ: The feeling will come back and it is the best thing you will ever do. I knew lack of sensation was a risk that I could lose all feeling after the surgery, but I had not processed what that really meant. So when I had almost no feeling immediately afterwards, I was not really prepared and had a bit of regret — although I loved how I looked and felt in my body otherwise. It took about three months for the feeling to return and it came gradually. So it was officially the best thing I ever did.

AJM: You will love it!

PB: I would tell myself: it’s becoming a quality of life issue and you will not regret it.

ZC: You have the right to feel good in your body. You don't have to live with your breasts for the rest of your life just because you know you're capable of it. Whatever doubts you're having now, the first time you stand up after surgery and feel the absence of weight on your chest, the incredible love you'll have for your own body will tell you it was the right thing to do.

LMV: Everything ZC said! Also, there is no one right way to be trans, and you know what’s best for your body. To the surgeon, the procedure is routine and safe, even if it feels scary to you.

LTW: It’s way less scary than you think it’s going to be! Also: never having to source speciality bras from Poland again is a godsend. Running without having to wrestle off a sweaty sports bra afterwards is even better. You are right; it isn’t going to instantaneously solve your relationship with your body. But just because it isn’t going to solve everything doesn’t mean that it won’t make things meaningfully better. •

If you have additional questions or just want to share more of your experience, the comments are waiting for you. As always, the comments are a subscriber-only space — and, today, a space to talk about personal experiences with a breast reduction or mastectomy, experiences assisting a person after a procedure, or for people contemplating either procedure to ask questions. This should go without saying, but I'll make it explicit: it is not a place for people outside of these experiences to offer their opinions.

I'll be monitoring the comments closely, but I also trust that we can keep this one of the good places on the internet.
