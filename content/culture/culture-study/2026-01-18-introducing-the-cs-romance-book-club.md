Today in ONE SMALL THING YOU CAN DO —

Hundreds of families in the Twin Cities can't leave their homes because of ICE surveillance — even to work. So today we're directing donations to [Neighbors Helping Neighbors](https://givebutter.com/nhn2026), which is providing emergency rent assistance (and groceries and household necessities) to families in need. Can you spare $5? $50? And can you circulate the link to others looking to help? None of this is enough. But it is something we can do right now.

I've been wanting to figure out a way to do a Culture Study book club for YEARS — but I could never quite figure out the right format. I didn't want it to involve a Zoom. I knew that attempts at "literary" bookclubs always sputtered — unless your entire newsletter was devoted to reading a book a chapter at a time (see: [The Big Read](https://thebigread.substack.com/)). Picking books is fraught. Facilitating asynchronous conversation is difficult. It all becomes VERY SERIOUS and VERY OVERDETERMINED and I would quickly come to resent it.

Romance lowers the bar. I don't mean that romance is lower quality; I mean that the books are far less likely to feel like a slog. Romance is hot and fun and filled with yearning, and sticking within a genre gives us a framework for endless discussion. (Tropes! Subversion thereof!) Who knows, maybe next year we'll do thrillers, or fantasy, but for right now — inspired, in part, by the wonderful discussion on last week's Heated Rivalry — we're alllllll romance. Starting with: M/M [That's the romance world's abbreviation for Male + Male Romance; you can find a larger glossary [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/wiki/glossary/)].

Here's How It Works:

Every month, we'll have TWO picks — usually under a general [very loose] theme. One will usually be historical [broadly conceived] and one will be more contemporary. We're gonna read classics; we're gonna read hyped new picks; we're gonna read self-published and mainstream and fanfic. This is a space for people who've been reading deeply in the genre for years and it's a space for people who are just getting started — side conversations can take us in all sorts of directions.

For this month, I've collaborated with CS reader Katie Fine and CS podcast producer (and avid romance reader) Melody Rowell to come up with two M/M picks, but for future months, we want your nominations, which you can submit via [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/7jprxYJNxVkU2yWbA).

How We'll Discuss:

We might switch this up, but for this month we're going to try having ONE CHAT ROOM dedicated to the book club. Every month we'll make a new room, so if you're catching up, you can still go back and scroll through the comments (or add your own).

We're using the chat rooms because 1) they allow us to post images/memes/Toks in a dynamic way; and 2) they also allow us to "hide" spoilers, since you can post a comment (that remains visible for all) and then all replies (including your own spoilery elaboration) is only visible to those who click on your comment. At least for this first round, we won't have any strict rules about when and how you comment (if we need to develop some, we will!) but we will abide by the general CS rules and work to keep it one of the good places on the internet.

Every month, we'll be highlighting a local romance bookstore if you're old school like me and like a print copy. This month, it's the great [TROPES & TRIFLES](https://www.instagram.com/tropesandtrifles/) in South Minneapolis, which has opened its doors as a place to rest, recharge, go to the bathroom, and warm up as ICE continues to terrorize the community they call home. They're an incredible community resource and we're thrilled to support them and their work in whatever way we can.

Who Can Participate:

Anyone with a CS subscription! (To join, [you know what to do](http://patreon.com/culturestudy/join?utm_id=7110537a-1e51-4b70-b617-854907855ed5&utm_medium=email); if you'd like to gift someone a subscription, [that's easy too](https://www.patreon.com/culturestudy/gift?utm_id=7110537a-1e51-4b70-b617-854907855ed5&utm_medium=email))
