First: Minnesotans are out there taking care of their neighbors — but they need our help. This weekend, Culture Study is raising money to support 50 families in the Powderhorn neighborhood and multiple families in the Columbia Heights neighborhood (where 5-year-old Liam Ramos was abducted). The funds go to cover back rent, next month's rent, utilities and groceries for families who are unable to leave their homes to work due to ICE

It's spectacularly easy to donate: [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-powderhorn-families-in-crisis) for Powderhorn and [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-local-CH-families) for Columbia Heights. If you're as furious as I am and can't be on the ground, direct that fury into care.

I also wanted to draw your attention to some of the things that meaningful to me in the wake of Alex Pretti's murder by ICE on the streets of Minneapolis yesterday morning:

Pretti was an ICU nurse in the VA. [This is footage of him reading the final salute to a vet who died under his care](https://bsky.app/profile/badideas.bsky.social/post/3md7kq2i35k2c). The son of the vet posted the video after learning of Pretti's death. This really affected me, so proceed with care.

[This breakdown of the footage of the shooting by the usually very conservative NYT is very clear](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/us/minneapolis-shooting-federal-agents-video.html?unlocked_article_code=1.HFA.pEHR.7WzeXFO65lbP&smid=url-share) — you can also watch the footage yourself here, but it does not auto-play. [I'd also watch this scene-by-scene analysis by Bellingcat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkFcFVZuBI0).

[M. Gessen on entering the logic of state terror](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/opinion/state-terror-has-arrived.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share): "If we don’t talk back, if we alter our routes to avoid protests, if we are lucky enough to be white, straight, natural-born Americans — or, if we are not, but we lie low, stay quiet — we will be safe. Conversely, we can choose to speak up, to go to protests, to take a risk. Either way, we tell ourselves, if we can predict the consequences, we have agency. But that’s not how state terror works."

Courageous signed affidavits from two witnesses on the scene: [a pediatrician](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758.109.0.pdf) and a [children's face painter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26505743-tinchersealedwitnessdec012426pdf/). Both of these are worth reading in full.

[Pretti's next door neighbor](https://www.instagram.com/p/DT6gjWzjBu4/): "The Alex I want the world to remember was out there on the streets with 50,000 people on general strike in a mass non-violent protest."

The statement from Pretti's parents, Michael and Susan Pretti:

Everyone I know in the Twin Cities is exhausted after a month of vigilance — if someone you love is there and doing the work in ways visible and invisible, message them, thank them, and ask if there's any material ways you can help. This is how we show up.

What I've written below is about tooth pain but it's also very clearly about our aching desire for care for ourselves in others in this moment — I hope that makes sense. I wrote it earlier this week; everything I was feeling then I feel even more profoundly now.
