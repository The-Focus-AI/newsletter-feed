You’re upset. We hear you, we understand — but we refuse to apologize. 
“Blackbird Spyplane,” you’re saying. “This past Tuesday, you dropped Part One of your 2026 Home Goods Guide, and it was fantastic. I loved how beautifully you made the case for neighborliness, and how you argued that when all is said and done, being neighborly might be the truest, deepest condition of being swaggy.” 
You’re right — thank you. 
“But the intel was so delightful and useful that, even though there was so much of it, of such high quality, I was angry when I came to the cliffhanger at the end. I wanted the home-goods intel to never stop. I wanted to find a way to live forever in your newsletter.”
We take some responsibility for that. It’s a peril that comes with creating the No. 1 source across all media for unbeatable recon. 
But none of us can live forever in the sletter. Some day, we all die, and there’s no reason we should look to that day with fear. Our energy is borrowed. At some point we must return it. And that is a poignant, horrible yet beautiful truth. 
“OK Plane,” you’ve got to concede, “fair enough. But I wanted to know about cool 
shower curtains, 
ceramics, 
dish-drying racks, 
paper-towel holders, 
furniture, 
blankets, 
undyed sheep’s wool rugs, 
cushions, 
storage,
tissue holders,
flatware,
and other home enswaggeners of that nature. Part One of the guide contained so much, but it didn’t contain intel on those things.”
Well, today we’re excited to release the Blackbird Spyplane Home Goods Guide: 2026 Edition: Part Two:   The Finale .
It does feature intel on all those things, and more. 
Access the full guide here …
And FYI you can find all of our home-goods guides & home-décor recon generally in our Home Goods Index, here .
Enjoy & peace!
