Before anything else — 
As you might have heard, Minneapolis organizers have called for a general strike across the U.S. tomorrow, Friday, June 30. Take off work, take off school, do no shopping, find a rally near you, show up alongside your brothers & sisters and, as dark as things feel, take comfort in the fact that there are more of us than there are of them.
