Hello and welcome back. Just one announcement today, which is that Coleman Hughes will be talking to that wonderful skeptic Michael Shermer on February 9. The topic is: How to Tell What’s True When Everyone’s Yelling. Seems. . . topical. And it’ll be at the Comedy Cellar, so you know it’s a good vibe. There will be drinks. Get your tickets here .
Now to the news.
→ Trump’s Board of Peace(™): President Donald J. this week has launched  his Board of Peace. It’s a parallel United Nations, but run by the United States and Trump is the leader of it , indefinitely. Will it replace the United Nations? It “might,” he said, but later said the board would have “tremendous potential with the United Nations.” So really he’s just creating more competition for international federations. A free market for free markets! By the way, everyone’s invited to Trump’s version of the UN: Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, even the Pope . No one is quite sure what the new Board of Peace means, exactly. “The pope has received an invitation and we are considering what to do,” the top Vatican diplomat told journalists. “I believe it will be something that requires a bit of time for consideration before giving a response.” Does the Board of Peace have an army? A constitution? Does it include Trump golf club memberships? Gift bags? Is it just that you get invited to Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff’s text chain? All we know for sure is that it costs $1 billion for a permanent seat on the Trump Board of Peace, which is just a little less than your average private K–8 school board seat.
When news broke about how expensive membership would be—ONE BILLION BIG ONES—the White House Rapid Response team pushed back . “This is misleading. There is no minimum membership fee to join the Board of Peace,” they wrote. Okay, cool, no membership fee! But then their next sentence: “This simply offers permanent membership to partner countries who demonstrate deep commitment to peace, security, and prosperity.” Okay, well. So. It’s not a membership fee, it’s just a demonstration of deep commitment that you want to keep your seat. This is like when the FP business team debates whether to rebrand our subscriptions as memberships. Like, I’m okay with that, I won’t fight it, but let’s all be adults here—it’s a subscription to a digital magazine, albeit with America’s most gorgeous Friday columnists. But it’s not a velvety club to drink a martini in. The United Nations, that den of iniquity, should absolutely be disbanded. I’m not sure I would replace it with the team behind the Trump Steak of the Month club and such, but no one else is offering. Not unrelated: Here is New Gaza , presented by Jared Kushner:
What is this, a clothing website I almost bought something from two years ago? And look at that new Board of Peace logo! It’s so. . . shiny and gold. Wasn’t NATO kind of the original Board of Peace? Are we ditching that one too?
For all the blinged-out renderings that the Board of Peace is bringing to the table, the United Nations’ counterproposal to New Gaza is to. . . let me find their PowerPoint. . . oh, right, it’s to just keep funding Hamas tunnels. Yes, the United Nations Article 9bumtickle752 that was unanimously approved by the Established Human Rights Council (members: Iran, China, and a screaming neo-Nazi) calls for continuous funding of ten thousand new Hamas tunnels. So we have a couple great options here, as always. 
Upon further review, this AI first draft looks good to me! Green light.
→ They call me Daddy: Aside from setting up the Board of Peace(™), Trump spent the week declaring war against Greenland. Someone had their coffee! He posted an image of himself planting an American flag  into Greenland’s frozen terrain. “I’m helping Europe. I’m helping NATO. And until the last few days, when I told them about Iceland, they loved me. They called me ‘daddy,’ right, last time?” Trump recalled  onstage at the World Economic Forum. “A very smart man said, ‘He’s our daddy. He’s running it.’ I was like, running it. I went from running it to being a terrible human being.” This reads like poetry performed in a freshman dorm and frankly, I’m uncomfortable for everyone involved. Eventually, Trump settled on a nice little deal to tide everyone over: Trump and the NATO leader (who I assume is Trump in a wig) agreed that the U.S. gets some more patches  of land out there. Okay, well, that one thing the American media could maybe try to do is be less hyperbolic about some of Trumpo’s saber-rattling. It’s called the art of the deal, people. A couple more military bases was always going to be the outcome here. But we have the most credulous group of panic addicts, so I’ve been reading too many articles about World War Greenland. Even if he did wage war in Greenland. . . don’t, like, four people live there? Their most fearsome weapon is an undomesticated cat.
During all this, Trump posted his apparently real text  from France’s president Emmanuel Macron, who wrote: “We are totally in line on Syria / We can do great things on Iran / I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.” We can do great things on Iran? Why are we worrying about Greenland, when we’re doing great things on Iran? What’s the line on Syria?
One tidbit I find so depressing about this war with Norway. . . he made María Corina Machado, the leader of the opposition party in Venezuela, hand over her Nobel Peace Prize. For real. He’s so bitter he wasn’t awarded this dumb prize by this fake committee that Machado hauled up to the White House with her prize and regifted it  in the hope that he will help the cause of Venezuela freedom. But doesn’t it have her name on it and stuff? Is Trump taking a Sharpie to that plaque right now? Also, he seemingly forgot her name , referring to her only as “she,” “a fine woman,” or “a person I have a lot of respect for.” Here’s Trump in his Greenland saber-rattling , saying to the Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre: “Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.” I bet you anything I know who the Board of Peace is awarding its inaugural peace prize to.
→ Canada prepping for American invasion: There are a lot of headlines out  of Canada like this one :
What model? Like what shade of white their surrender flag should be? Eggshell? Pearl? Canada, thanks for Heated Rivalry—which I refuse to watch—but I think that’s the extent of our interactions this year.
I’m the only one with Greater America ambitions, and not a single soul on this green earth takes their marching orders from me, much as I try. No one is invading Canada. But I do love that the reports on Canada’s prep all include the idea that their response will be “Taliban-like .” You think you’re gonna get young Canucks to do suicide bombings? Just because you have a lot of immigrants does not make your army “Taliban-like,” you silly Canadian geese. They’re not dying for Ottawa, I’ll tell you that much. The maple syrup’s good, but it ain’t that good.
→ Someone needs to take away Alex Soros’s social media: The Soros family, when claiming their politicians, should stop bragging about it. Young Alex Soros—the boy king chosen to shepherd his father’s vast resources toward another generation of the most lunatic left-wing causes—posted a selfie  with Gavin Newsom. Like he’s a new Pokémon for Young Alex. See, I actually like Gavin a lot! I want to vote for Gavin for things. I don’t care about the fake California high-speed rail, the homelessness corruption. I like Gavin’s aggressive sociopath energy. I like his whole attractive Marin family, and I like that his scandals involve the French Laundry . I like that his hair likely takes multiple products and daily regimens to maintain. I don’t want to explain myself. Votes are private. But even I balk at this. Alex Soros, buy your politicians in private. Do not make them do a walk of shame and share pictures of them in their lingerie to show the world that you can buy whatever you want. We get it. But someone might marry that girl one day and now look what you’ve done to her.
→ DSA and CCP: The Democratic Socialists of America are taking their marching orders from the Chinese Communist Party. We already knew that they were, emotionally, vibes-wise. But now it looks like they really are coordinating with the CCP. Here’s  Newsweek : “The minutes of the DSA meetings show participants discussing contacts with officials from China’s ruling party in the name of ‘anti-imperialism,’ with some members saying the organization should avoid topics that are sensitive for Beijing, such as China’s threats to invade Taiwan, its security crackdown in Hong Kong, and abuses of the Uyghur Muslim minority. They also discuss visits to China.” All’s fair in love and war, so China now has their American footsoldiers. My main complaint is why don’t we do this to China’s wacky political fringe? Why aren’t we cultivating young Chinese soldiers for America? All we have are some random Mandarin-language CIA recruitment videos ? Pathetic. We export American culture, yes, but it’s all made by those same DSA members. Why are they so good at making things! Socialists make the best pizza, the best lattes, the best adorable street festivals with sidewalk chalk art. My life is produced by people who report directly to Xi Jinping.
Stop reading so much news, and instead enjoy this interlude from The Free Press’s resident cartoonist, David Mamet:
→ A new era of martyrdom: The Episcopal Church of New Hampshire is ready for frickin’ war. The Episcopalians are amped up. Bishop Rob’s reflection from earlier this month : “We are now, I believe, entering a time, a new era of martyrdom.” Of his priests: “And I’ve asked them to get their affairs in order—to make sure they have their wills written, because it may be that now is no longer the time for statements, but for us with our bodies to stand between the powers of this world and the most vulnerable.” These guys are not kidding around anymore. They are ready to die. And there will be cookies after the sermon.
Meanwhile, Don Lemon is back! Remember Don Lemon? He’s live-streaming from anti-ICE protests. He says he was initially confused about the protest because there were American flags, which was “MAGA-coded,” but that he had found the right spot. Here’s Don : “I’ve been surprised, pleasantly surprised, to see the community coming together, diverse community. When we first pulled up, we were like, ‘wait a minute, which operation are we at?’ and as it turns out—’cause we were like, ‘whoa, this is kind of MAGA-coded, right?’—saw the American flag or whatever—but these are resistance protesters. They’re planning an operation that we’re going to follow them on. I can’t tell you exactly what they’re doing but it’s called Operation Pull-Up.” And where were they all going? To storm a church ! To storm Cities Church in Minnesota, in the middle of services, because one of the eight pastors supposedly works with ICE . So they interrupted service for 25 minutes and screamed for a while about how we need open borders. I love this new antifa Don. His independent makeover. You know he’s gonna go absolutely crazy. You know it’ll be collabs with Candy O soon. I can assure you, chemtrails are coming. The “DL” mic branding and “Lemon Head” merch is the writing on the wall.
Does that bandana come in human?
→ Breaching the details: In the latest crime committed by our gray lady . . . I’m nearing a heart attack after reading this paragraph , written by The New York Times global economy reporter:
“Accused of breaching the details.” I love that. Minor little detail breaches. As for climate change, don’t make me post China’s carbon emissions chart again. Okay, I’ll do it.
→ The Panopticon: Shabana Mahmood, the current United Kingdom home secretary, was very honest  about how the UK is doing its police work.
When I was in justice, my ultimate vision for that part of the criminal justice system was to achieve, by means of AI and technology, what Jeremy Bentham tried to do with his Panopticon. That is that the eyes of the state can be on you at all times. Similarly, in the world of policing, in particular, we’ve already been rolling out live facial recognition technology, but I think there’s big space here for being able to harness the power of AI and tech to get ahead of the criminals, frankly, which is what we’re trying to do.”
Oh, I guess we’re just saying the quiet part out loud now in the UK?
Shabana’s AI panopticon will get ahead of the criminals. . . . Not me. My ChatGPT would read me as so innocuous I probably could commit any crime I want today. All I do is ask about recipes, parenting, and rashes. I could steal a car and blow up a bridge and my ChatGPT would testify on my behalf that it is quite statistically impossible for me to have done so because I consume only Crock-Pot recipe content. I asked Chat to create a picture of what it thinks I look like and it showed me an elderly Asian man. I was honored. Anyway, as with all utopian ideas, I love Shabana’s panopticon, so long as I’m the one in charge. If I’m in charge, then it is pure and just. If my enemies are in charge, then it is evil and must be destroyed.
→ Requiem for Iran: The Iranians didn’t attend the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, a shame to miss them on the slopes. They could’ve at least joined for an aprés ski Hugo spritz. Here’s how the WEF explained it :
The tragic loss of lives? Like there was a flood. What terrible natural disaster ended in the tragic loss of lives? Oh, it was the wanton slaughter of protesters by the Iranian regime. It was them marching into hospitals and shooting people . Iran has some strong defenders. Tragic.
Here’s our trusty Tucker Carlson arguing that it could be good  for Iran to get a nuke: “Could the Iranians obtaining The Bomb wind up being a good thing? Whether anyone in the foreign policy establishment admits it, North Korea’s nuclearization has undeniably stabilized the Korean Peninsula.” Why not. What’s the worst that can happen. North Korea is a beautiful success story and that is just the cold, hard truth. At least Tuck is brave enough to say it. Here’s Roger Waters, who for some reason gets invited on news shows to spout on about politics : “We know they don’t want the Shah’s son back. . . . We know the Iranians do not want regime change. . . . The government sent the police out to protect those grocers.” Yes, the argument from those on the pro–Iranian regime side is that Iran should have nukes, and also quelling these protesters was just about, I don’t know, protecting local grocers. How sweet. Have a clementine, prisoner.
→ A lot more abortions all of a sudden: Abortions in England and Wales rose 11 percent  to a record 277,970 in 2023.
UK health experts linked it to  cost-of-living pressures and trouble accessing contraception. But that just seems crazy. Condoms are everywhere; no one has sex. And yet abortions are this high? I guess it’s about the abortion pills making it all so easy. The long, slow death of Europe is suddenly not so slow at all. It’s over the counter!
→ There could be a hawk there: I just have to drop a random housing item in. Because it’s so representative of what happens in cities around the country. And I deserve this treat. And I didn’t get the reaction I wanted the eight times I’ve explained this over dinner so here it goes: An attractive three-story housing and retail project has been stopped in one northern California city because, in part, there could be a hawk there. Literally a lawsuit alleged that  “the city didn’t consider possible impacts from the project’s plan to cut down trees on the vacant lot of 603 Sutter that could be home to the endangered Swainson’s hawk.” Approval pulled. Project killed. Is there an endangered Swainson’s hawk on that abandoned lot? Maybe. We have no idea. The better question is: Why does it even matter? Can’t hawks fly? The hawk isn’t living in a 2BR/2BA. Can’t he move? Or are rents skyrocketing on nearby trees?
→ Vendôme antisemite party: This past weekend a group of America’s preeminent Jew-haters got together to flex their muscles (unless you’re Fuentes) and show that the water is warm for racists who also hate women. They gathered to livestream and dance to Ye’s song “Heil Hitler”  at a Miami nightclub. All dressed up in their Sunday best :
This photo smells like Dior Sauvage and a chloroform rag. It takes a serious bunch of freaks to make Andrew Tate look like the most responsible man in the room. It’s almost impressive how this group—which includes a Mexican incel, a few Muslim dudes, and a kid who does meth to keep his cheekbones up—has become the modern face of white supremacist eugenics. These roided-up streamers in tight pants are in now way what the architects of the “master race” envisioned as their offspring. Dress for the job you want, I guess.
If any of you TGIFers are bicurious or teetering on lesbianism, this photo should clear things up. Thank me later, and enjoy a long life with your “good friend” Susan. Or maybe thank me now, before I get shoved into their musty trafficking van.
→ This is how you run for office in New York now: Jose Vega, running for Congress in the Bronx, appears in a new video  standing beside a guy named Erik Warsaw, who’s here to give the pitch. Take it away Erik: “The Bronx is one of the poorest districts in America but also has some of the richest Zionist millionaires in America, too.” They “all live in Riverdale,” a Bronx neighborhood known for its Jewish community. You get the idea. JewMoneydale, if you need it spelled out.
Then, outside a Jewish center hosting an Israeli comedian in Toronto, a mob chanted  “Allahu Akbar” as fresh graffiti appeared  in the city reading “kill Jews for peace.” Bulletproof logic right there. And in a Jewish neighborhood of Toronto , protesters marched through screaming “one, two, three, four, Zionism no more.”
Anyway, these are the forces arrayed against Jewish life and against normal, peaceful life in the West more broadly. They want revolution. Me, I don’t. I just want life to stay exactly as it is, or maybe go back only to 1995. That seemed nice.
→ Is whole milk Hitler? Is Trump “Milk Hitler”? Milch Kampf? The White House posted “Whole milk is back,” to which the account “Canada Hates Trump” responded “So is Hitler ,” with a swastika swinging over Trump’s face, revealing Adolf underneath. That seems like a big leap, no? Why is whole milk so bad, Canada? You’ve heard of the Soup Nazi, now get ready for Milk Hitler. He’s frothing at the mouth for Canadian heads and will pasteurize anyone who stands in his way. Anyway, the White House has launched a new pro–whole milk campaign and people think it’s funny. Like, whole milk was banned? Who banned it, they ask? Well: The Obama administration literally banned whole milk  and even 2% milk from schools. Another win for MAHA. Gotta say, I’m impressed. We are out of the Milkhibition era. Finally, I can take my milk flask out of my hollowed-out book and stop drinking Stonyfield 10% fat from my shoe heel.
→ All the greed ended: Here’s the price of eggs  now.
Remember when the prices were high and everyone blamed corporate greed? Did the greed go away? No, people are still monsters. All that happened is inflation is falling and eggs are bountiful. Though not the type I buy: Your education cost less than a dozen of these bad boys. But try to look for stories about the low cost of normal eggs, and you’ll come up pretty empty-handed. Where’s the update , Associated Press? What, we can’t have good news? Seggs sells!
→ Flights are going to get cheaper: Call it Ozempic savings. The skinny bitch dividend. Lighter passengers mean lighter planes, lower fuel burn, and fatter airline margins. The financial services firm Jefferies estimates a 10 percent drop in average passenger weight could cut fuel costs  by up to 1.5 percent and lift earnings per share by as much as 4 percent, with the biggest upside for American Airlines. I don’t need to explain why. I wonder if Ozempic could’ve prevented the Titanic from sinking.
→ This just looks really slidey still: This is the big repair of California’s Highway 1 . This is the three-year-long project, the long-awaited fix:
No rain could ever wash that away. It was very wise not to chip even an inch into that hillside. Keep it raw. Keep it narrow. Like Roman aqueducts, this road will stand the test of time.
→ Ten people familiar: I don’t know about you, but I need more deep-dive profiles of Bar. There are parts of her life that are still a mystery to me, like what music played at her bat mitzvah (okay fine, I know the answer to that one, it was the Fiddler on the Roof soundtrack). I’d like some quotes from the DJ, though, please, on her general demeanor that night. The latest this week : “Ten people familiar with the workings of CBS News say the Paramount Skydance unit is veering toward dysfunction, with a management team led by Bari Weiss that doesn’t value the standards held by veteran journalists.” Ten people?! Not ten people. In a 1,500-person company. Guys, 10 people glared at me on my walk to get a coffee this morning. I piss off 10 people every time I’m at the grocery store. Yes, 10 people think she needs to better respect legacy journalist standards. I’ll know it finally worked when Bar tells me, with a straight face, that Covid came from a wet market. Then she’s outta my house, according to one person familiar.
