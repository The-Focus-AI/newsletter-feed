On December 31, The Washington Post carried the headline  “Washington Monument illuminated on New Year’s Eve to mark country’s 250th.” The article described an installation that projected patriotic images onto the monument and noted that the display “kicks off a year of events on the National Mall to mark the nation’s 250th.”
Such peculiarly vague locutions, an adjective without a noun, are everywhere in this year’s civic festivities. We say “America’s 250th” or “America at 250.” In 1976, people did something similar by calling that year’s celebrations simply “the bicentennial.” Some call this year “the semiquincentennial,” which is just as indeterminate as “the 250th” but harder to pronounce.
This vagueness is not a coincidence. It points to our uncertainty about how to approach what ought to be a year of patriotic celebration. When you mark a wedding anniversary, you don’t just call it “the 25th.” When you wish someone a happy 40th, they know perfectly well you mean a birthday. But as we approach this civic milestone, we are oddly at a loss for words—because we are unsure quite what kind of occasion we are marking, and therefore how we should mark it.
So let’s ask plainly: What kind of occasion is “America’s 250th”?
The natural answer is that we are celebrating a birthday. America is turning 250 years old, and that calls for a national birthday party.
This is almost instinctively how a lot of our plans are taking shape. The first image projected onto the Washington Monument on New Year’s Eve was a 250-foot birthday candle. Many of the grandest public events being planned aim to feel like a birthday party.
And it makes sense. Abraham Lincoln thought about the founding this way. In 1863, he opened the Gettysburg Address  with words so familiar that we can forget what image they were meant to convey: “Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” What happened in 1776, Lincoln said, was that a new nation was conceived and brought forth. And he closed by urging that the Civil War might yield “a new birth of freedom,” echoing that first birth at the founding.
Yet the limits of the birthday metaphor are already implicit in Lincoln’s language. The new nation, he said, was not merely conceived and born; it was dedicated to a proposition. Lincoln wanted to point beyond a beginning to an achievement: a distinct commitment, an ambition meant to exert a lasting pull on the minds of later Americans.
That is not how a birthday usually works. Birthday celebrations do not really mark the meaning of the birth itself; they mark the time since that moment—the path traveled, the age achieved, the growth and development that followed birth.
To be sure, 250 years of growth is part of what we celebrate this year. The sheer age of our republic is an achievement. Ours is among the oldest regimes in today’s world, and that is nothing to sneer at. Long life is a mark of health.
Still, the birthday of an older person is rarely an occasion to look forward. And even at its most appropriate, the comparison to a birthday doesn’t capture what we celebrate on the Fourth of July. When we mark that day, we point to what was said and done in 1776, and what it made possible.
What you and I did on the day we were born was not very impressive. What happened in the founding era was. So while there is nothing wrong with a birthday party for the nation, it is not exactly the right way to express our admiration.
America’s 250th isn’t just a birthday.
So what else is it? When we don’t use the language of a birthday, we often fall back on the language of an anniversary: This year is the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
An anniversary marks an event rather than merely time since a beginning, and so it addresses part of what the birthday metaphor misses. Strange as it might sound, the kind of anniversary that might come to mind first—a wedding anniversary—offers a surprisingly apt analogy. What we commemorate on the Fourth of July is a decision to start something together. It is the anniversary of a union.
This isn’t immediately obvious because we are naturally used to thinking of American independence as the result of a decision to separate, not to unite. That is what the Declaration of Independence  declares, after all. But again, we should take care to actually notice the words in this familiar civic writ: The Declaration begins by declaring it “necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another.” Before it really says anything, it declares the Americans to be one people.
In fact, even before that, in its heading, the declaration describes itself as “The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America.” That phrase—“united States of America”—was at the time not a proper name but a description. That’s why “united” wasn’t capitalized. The Declaration did not only announce a break. It announced a joining.
To mark the Fourth of July, then, is to mark the founders’ decision to unite so that a common life could be possible for us. From the point of view of the political descendants of the founders, the founding was more a marriage than a divorce. We are not children of divorce but the heirs of a commitment to chart a future together.
An anniversary, in this respect, is a better analogy than a birthday. It marvels not only at our country’s beginning but at the span of time over which it has persisted—through affection, commitment, effort, and no small measure of luck. And a wedding anniversary is not merely retrospective. It suggests that with continuing devotion, the union can deepen and strengthen.
It also points to a commitment that remains binding. The Declaration did not merely do something once upon a time. It continues to do its work because it continues to call us to live according to the dedication it announced.
Here too, Lincoln can help. After the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott v. Sandford decision in 1857 denied citizenship to black Americans, Lincoln argued  that the justices had rejected the Declaration’s premise. If the document’s purpose had merely been separation, he said, then “that object having been effected some eighty years ago, the Declaration is of no practical use now.” But it was, and is, of continuing use, because it asserted a substantive fidelity that must continue to bind (and therefore liberate) Americans in every generation.
So America’s 250th is not just a birthday; it is also an anniversary. But even this still doesn’t quite capture what this occasion needs to be for us.
We can see what’s still missing by focusing on another simple question: For whom is this occasion? Your birthday points to your own beginning. Your parents’ wedding anniversary commemorates something other people did from which you have benefited. Which applies to a celebration of the founding? Is it about “us” or “them”?
The nation’s founding is our beginning in the sense that this is our nation, and it has existed continuously since the founding era. But you and I did not found it. We inherited it.
Maybe you were born here. Maybe, like me, you came here from somewhere else and in time embraced American citizenship. Either way, America was here. We didn’t create it. And most of us are not descended from the founders in any biological sense. Who are the founders to us? In what sense can we celebrate what they did as ours?
Americans have long wrestled with this question. And we have tended to answer it in two ways: one conceptual, one visceral.
One answer points to ideas that connect us across generations. Here again Lincoln offers the clearest model. In an 1858 speech , he considered Americans who were not descended from the founding generation but were immigrants or descendants of immigrants. When they look back to the founding, he said, they find no connection to it by blood. But, he continued,
when they look through that old Declaration of Independence they find that those old men say that “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,” and then they feel that that moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men, that it is the father of all moral principle in them, and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are.
Blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh of the founders: I can’t think of those words without getting goose bumps, because they are about me. They are about you too. They tell us that we are Americans, descended from the founders, because we know that what they declared was true, is true, and always will be true, and we mean to live our national life by that knowledge.
This is an extraordinarily powerful connection to have with the founders. But it is not enough on its own, because it is abstract. A nation is not an idea floating free of time and place. It is a living society with a character and history. It consists of real people to whom we owe loyalty. They are our neighbors and fellow citizens, as well as prior generations of our families and communities. Together they have formed the culture that produced us and have given us our identity, our common memory, and our sense of self. All of that has happened in a particular place that we love. It’s physical and real. And its story begins at the founding of our country.
American identity is therefore both philosophical and visceral. The ideals we share are the soul of our patriotism; our shared history and experience are its body. We cannot do without either.
Some people today insist we must choose between these modes of attachment: Our love of country is either about only universal ideals or it is grounded purely in a shared ancestral experience. But American patriotism is a combination of the two. We should want neither a disembodied patriotism nor a soulless one. The first would be too airy and ungrounded; the second too insular and hard.
While there is nothing wrong with a birthday party for the nation, it is not exactly the right way to express our admiration.
We share a common home in which we have lived a common life over generations, and that common life has been oriented by a set of ideals—religious and philosophical, republican and liberal, including a belief in natural rights rooted in natural equality and pointing toward a politics of justice. There is no contradiction here.
Lincoln captured this balance in writing about his hero Henry Clay: Clay, he said , “loved his country partly because it was his own country, but mostly because it was a free country.” That is a model of patriotic love suited to America.
And it can move us beyond birthdays and anniversaries toward a more demanding analogy—to the intergenerational bonds by which a people is formed. We love our family because we belong to it. But we also love it because it has formed us toward flourishing—because parents and grandparents have passed down culture, faith, loyalty, community, and memory. They have offered us an understanding of what is beautiful and true. The nation does something similar.
We should not mistake the analogy: Politics is not family life, the president is not the father of the nation, and political disputes are not household squabbles. But a nation must be understood intergenerationally. Our relation to our political tradition—our connection to what we celebrate this year—can be clarified by thinking about how we relate to the sources of our being: our parents and ancestors.
That is ultimately what the question “How should we celebrate America’s 250th?” is getting at. How should we understand our relation to a tradition that spans generations and that has a claim on us even though we did not choose it?
It’s a difficult question in a free society, because it forces us to confront the limits of our freedom. All of us were born into a world that was already here. We did not make it or decide where and when to enter it. Yet we are shaped and bounded by its inherited orders. We could reject those inheritances, but that would mean rejecting something of ourselves, which cannot be done lightly.
Some thinkers have argued that every generation should be free to begin again from scratch, free of the burdens of other people’s choices. Even Thomas Jefferson thought so  at one point, after he had spent a little too long in France. But insisting that only our own choices can legitimate our way of life is not just impractical, it is unreasonable. It says that to embrace a tradition is to accept what other people in the past have believed because they somehow have authority over us.
The question of tradition, however, is not about believing what other people once believed but about living as our people have long lived. It is about the reality that we are links in a chain. And yet, tradition cannot be embraced blindly. We must find a balance between reverence and judgment, between gratitude and independence, between the errors of radical self-creation and unthinking submission.
How can we find that balance? This is of course just another way of putting the very question we are turning over and over together—the question of America’s 250th.
We happen to be playing our part in the long chain of generations that has composed the American nation 250 years after it was founded. How should we mark that occasion in light of the difficult balance we’re looking to strike? How should we regard the tradition we are called on to commemorate and to continue? What is the right attitude to have toward the American founding?
To ask that question is to see how the right kind of limited family analogy can help us answer it.
The great historian Jaroslav Pelikan once suggested  that we might think about our relation to our traditions by considering the ways children relate to their parents. We might think of three general ways we do that.
First, there is a childish way. Young children often believe their parents are perfect. They are strong and sure and have all the answers. When something goes wrong, you go to Mom or Dad, and it gets fixed. It’s easy to find examples of this childish way of thinking of our nation’s founders—viewing them through marble statues of unblemished heroes on horseback, unerring, perfect people who have all the answers. This kind of patriotism may be fine for the very young, but it goes only so far. And it easily bleeds into idolatry.
Second, there is a juvenile way. As children grow into adolescence, they discover their parents are not perfect. They have failings and blind spots. They lied to you about the tooth fairy, so what else are they lying about? Maybe they’re lying about everything. Disillusioned by parental shortcomings, you come to believe they are fully defined by their worst vices and sins, so that whatever they are is what you don’t want to be.
There are examples of this juvenile way of thinking about the origins of our political tradition all around us now. It tells us that the founders were just grubby, rich, white men making excuses for themselves; that slavery was all they cared about; that their eloquent words were just cover for naked interest or worse. They weren’t just imperfect—they were perfectly awful. This is the dominant way of understanding the founding among American intellectuals and academics now. It’s puerile and foolish. And it easily bleeds into iconoclasm.
But these are not our only options: idolatry or iconoclasm. There’s another, better, model.
When you get a little older, especially when you have children of your own, you gradually arrive at a different kind of relation to your parents. Maybe one day you find yourself telling a toddler not to eat pasta with her hands or you hear yourself yelling at your 8-year-old not to run down the stairs, and you suddenly realize: “I am my parents.”
A nation is not an idea floating free of time and place. It consists of real people to whom we owe loyalty.
I am my parents. I’m doing what they were doing. In some respects, I’m not nearly as good at it as they were and can learn from them. In other ways, I can see things they did wrong and do a little better. But in both respects, I approach their example with reverence, because I understand what they were trying to achieve. I see that they were limited human beings like I am, and that what they did—for all their flaws—was a pretty admirable attempt to use the one life they got to live for something good.
That is the posture we should aim to have toward the traditions we inhabit. Our national tradition is certainly not right about everything, but it’s right about more than we would be without it. Especially if it began from core truths that are permanent, a tradition can enable us to build on the triumphs of prior generations without ignoring their mistakes.
The founding generation of our nation was trying to do something we are also trying to do: enable a vast, diverse, complicated society full of dynamic, crazy, freedom-loving people to live together and address common problems while taking the truths about the human condition seriously. In some respects, they did it better than we could. George Washington was a better natural leader than any of us. James Madison thought more deeply about institutional design than any of us. We should preserve and reinforce what they built.
In other respects, they failed terribly to live up to their own standards and to ours. Washington and Madison both held other human beings in bondage. We should not excuse that. We should learn from it about the human temptation to avert our eyes from plain injustice—a temptation to which we are far from immune today.
A mature patriotism can hold these truths together. The founders were neither superhuman heroes nor subhuman villains. They were human beings confronting human problems, and they left us institutions and lessons of incalculable value. We can be grateful, clear-eyed, and reverent all at once—rooted in the knowledge that we did not earn the gift they bequeathed to us, but confident that we can earn it now by handing it down improved to our children.
That is what it would mean to understand ourselves as living within the same tradition they did; to say “us” and “our country” when we talk about them. We are a single people over time. We are still the ones who did it and can do it now.
In every generation, there are escapists who want to run away from the obligations that our tradition imposes on us by insisting that this generation faces completely different and much harder challenges, so that the old ways have nothing to offer us. The world has changed and has rendered our inheritance useless or worse. In our time, some of these Jacobins even masquerade as traditionalists. Yet they deny the fundamental premise of traditionalism: that the core human challenges are the same in every generation and what makes this time distinct is not that the basic work to be done is different but that it is our turn to do that hard work. There is no excuse for shirking it.
So let us turn back to Lincoln one last time and agree wholeheartedly with the fundamental message of the Gettysburg Address. Standing over the graves of fallen Union soldiers and appealing to both the body and soul of American patriotism, Lincoln argued that what is demanded of the living is a recommitment to America’s intergenerational cause, “that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.”
In celebrating America’s 250th, we are recommitting ourselves to a national cause that we did not choose but which we now see that we would and should choose.
We do this not because prior generations offer us a model of perfection—they certainly do not. We do it because they offer us a model of contending with imperfection and of striving toward the good and the true. This is what it means to celebrate our country this year: We affirm the rightness of the original choice made by prior generations by making that same choice again ourselves.
Our political tradition articulates the terms of that choice unusually clearly for us in the Declaration of Independence. We choose to live in light of the truth that we are all created equal, and of its implications. We haven’t always lived up to the standard of that truth, but it has always been there to hold us to account. We are a nation that, in moments of great national celebration, feels compelled to recur to that truth: to repeat it, to restate it, to recommit to it, and in that peculiar way to celebrate ourselves.
That’s the kind of celebration we should strive for this year. Call it a birthday, call it an anniversary, call it whatever you will. But treat it as an opportunity for mature, reverent reflection and judgment about the political tradition we are privileged to be part of and the nation we are privileged to belong to—an opportunity for gratitude, and therefore for hope.
Happy 250th.
