Welcome to Things Worth Remembering, our weekly column in which writers share a poem or paragraph that all of us should commit to heart. This week, award-winning sportswriter Peter Richmond looks back on the moment his career took a remarkable turn, sparked by poetry from an unlikely source: Elvis Costello.
My ninth-grade English teacher, Mac, was appropriately English. He favored tweed jackets, sweater-vests, and tortoiseshell glasses, and spoke in a very Merchant Ivory voice—which he frequently used to emphasize to the class that the poetry of a handful of white European men from distant centuries represented the pinnacle of Western literature. Poetry, Mac said, in the exactitude of its language and form, held the key to the exquisite beauty of the literary promised land.
Mac was a great teacher, so I trusted him. But I could not untangle the words of Lord Byron and John Keats. “Lethe-wards had sunk” wasn’t the kind of phrase that made me want to know what Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale” was trying to tell me. I knew I wanted to be a writer, but I liked to read and write stories that had a narrative arc. Poems generally left me wondering why the sentences were randomly diced up; if they were even sentences at all. And so, for many years, I believed that until I found a way into the lyrical mysteries of classical poetry, I’d be forever deprived literarily, and a lesser writer for it.
That is, until 14 years later, in 1982, when a friend arrived at my doorstep with a new album she wanted to share: Elvis Costello’s Imperial Bedroom. She knew I wasn’t a huge Costello fan at the time, preferring the harder punk stuff. But the album included a song called “Beyond Belief ,” a driving, energetic anthem whose opening verse stopped me in my proverbial tracks:
History repeats the old conceits
The glib replies, the same defeats
Keep your finger on important issues
With crocodile tears and a pocketful of tissues.
But wait. I had heard this thought before: five years earlier, in a different figurative language. As a philosophy major at Yale, I studied the Spanish American philosopher George Santayana, known for his 1905 observation: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”
At the time, I sort of processed the sentiment. But Santayana’s words didn’t really resonate. For one thing, at age 19, I didn’t have enough of a personal history to know what history really was, other than how it had been taught to me: dryly and stalely, as an assemblage of facts.
For another, the message simply wasn’t powerful enough to break through my teenage complacency. After graduating 1,492nd (yep) in my class of around 1,500, I didn’t have the ambition to move out of my college town, so I wrote for the now-defunct New Haven Journal-Courier. There, despite being kind of high most of the time, I wrote a column that won an award, and lucked into a gig at The Washington Post. Naturally, I felt I deserved it. The Post disagreed. I was a lazy, narcissistic, inconsiderate jerk. The acclaimed paper did not countenance my kind, and I washed out within 18 months.
Thanks to a friend, I found myself at the rather sad city newspaper in San Diego, a place where no one actually reads. That I was now reporting stories with headlines like “Area Pet Stores Caution Against Buying a Puppy on Impulse at Christmas,” didn’t strike me as a big deal. I’d file my stories, leave the office, and dive into the perfectly temperatured Pacific at sundown. The money was good enough. Life was sweet, if stupid.
But then, about a year into the job, “Beyond Belief” landed on my turntable—and Santayana’s notion, translated into a really good song, became not only clear, but relevant. Why hadn’t I understood until then what I should have grokked the first time around? That “history,” as practiced by humans, is nothing but endlessly recurring themes, most of them eventually disastrous? That to meaningfully change things, playing a new one is essential?
Maybe because I hadn’t wanted to look back and stare the pattern of my life in the face: At every step, starting in seventh-grade boarding school, through the preps and the Ivies, I’d put in just enough effort to get by. I could spin a good sentence, better than lots of my peers, and that had been good enough.
Now, thanks to an artist I’d previously dismissed as pretentious and shallow, I was about to undergo a sea change. I could not get the song out of my head. Friends who dropped by for beers, expecting me to spin some Clash, X, or My Bloody Valentine, would instead be treated to a Costello song—”You have to hear this!”
I’d hum “Beyond Belief” driving to the office, and on my runs. It became my soundtrack. I can’t confidently say that the song was the steering wheel of a new attitude, but when I look at what happened next, there’s no question that I’d started being a little more enterprising.
And when luck arrived, I ran with it.
That year, the Falklands War had just broken out. I was drinking beer in a questionable bar when a couple of sailors from one of the 50 nearby fleet ships sat down next to me. Curious, I asked them if they wanted to be in on the action 7,000 miles away. No fucking way, they said. So the next day I combed the city to find sailors to ask the same question. More than a dozen confided that they had no desire to be amid rockets and bombs. They liked being moored in San Diego.
Poetry evolves, takes on any shape it wants, but it’s united by its ability to impart timeless wisdom to readers and listeners in desperate need of it.
The story ran on the front page of my paper, and the Navy went ballistic. But it also happened that a convention of managing editors was in town, and it caught the notice of the managing editor of the Miami Herald. That led to a national sportswriting gig, then a Harvard journalism fellowship, then a high-visibility staff writing job at GQ magazine—where I really had to work at my craft—and, finally, a half-dozen books, including a New York Times bestseller.
All of the boldfaced parties and anthology appearances were good for the ego. But what my new station was really good for was giving me actual self-esteem—which, beneath my fancy sentences, I’d come to see was severely lacking.
Apparently, I’d shed most of the old conceits. And along the way, happily, I’d finally come to understand what a poem was, at least for me: a text of precious length, that comes alive in the right time and place and circumstance, exactly when I need it. For some, that may very well be Byron or Keats. For me, it was words backed by a soundtrack of notes that, since someone first blew into a bone flute 35,000 years ago, have emerged as music.
Mac would have applauded Costello’s four lines if I’d written a paper for him a decade and a half later on how the word “poetry” finally clicked in my consciousness. “Yes, certainly, Peter,” he’d have said, “there’s a resonance to this Costello’s work, metaphor- and meter-wise. But please, don’t make me listen to the music. Why is his voice so annoying?”
Annoying or not, that voice imparted words that helped me climb out of the rut I’d dug for myself, and made me realize that the circulating pattern of my life wasn’t destiny. The idea that true poetry was defined many hundreds of years ago, a notion widely held by a whole lot of smart people? No. Poetry evolves, takes on any shape it wants, but it’s united by its ability to impart timeless wisdom to readers and listeners in desperate need of it. What a shame that conventional wisdom deems most poetry inaccessible. And what a beautiful thing that music so often proves that belief wrong.
In the 1990s, ESPN created a channel called ESPN Classic. Since I wrote about sports, the channel would occasionally call me to appear on panels with other sportswriters. One episode about football involved a discussion of how the New York Giants, owned since their 1925 inception by one family, seemed cursed by their inability to adapt to new times and craft a competitive roster.
Suddenly, I found myself reciting Costello’s poem.
“Who wrote that?” asked another writer, maybe 10 years my senior, finding it all kind of pretentious.
“Elvis,” I said.
“Elvis never wrote that,” he said, dismissively.
“Yeah, he definitely did,” I said. I totally remember it.
Things Worth Remembering will be back in your inbox next Sunday. In case you missed it, last week, Douglas Century marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day with a reflection on  “Eli, Eli,” a poem sung by millions every year to honor the murdered.
