Welcome to Things Worth Remembering, our weekly column in which writers share a poem or paragraph that all of us should commit to heart. This week, on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Jonathan Eig reflects on the very last speech Dr. King ever gave: a profound display of devotion to the principles of a nation that had turned on him.
Didn’t Martin Luther King Jr. have someplace better to be on April 3, 1968, than Memphis, Tennessee, in support of a sanitation workers’ strike?
Not really.
By then, King was almost five years removed from his “I Have a Dream” address at the March on Washington. His powers were waning. The civil rights movement was waning, too. The Vietnam War had shattered the liberal consensus for King’s proposed civil and economic policies, and protests in American cities were erupting in very un-Kingian violence. In a private phone call recorded by the FBI, King told one of his friends that he felt as if no one was listening to him anymore. And he was right: When asked in a Gallup survey  how they felt about King, nearly two-thirds of Americans said they disapproved of his activities.
King told his wife, Coretta, that he was tired, didn’t feel like talking to people, didn’t have answers anymore. And yet, he was weeks away from launching his most ambitious demonstration in years: the so-called Poor People’s Campaign, in which he planned to occupy much of Washington, D.C., until the federal government agreed to fundamental changes in the American economy, including guaranteed jobs and guaranteed income.
But that wasn’t going well, either. Hoping to attract thousands of pledged protesters, his organizers were struggling to hit triple digits.
That’s why King was in Memphis on April 3, against the wishes of most of his advisers. And that’s where he would give the last speech of his life.
The protest in Memphis had attracted little media attention, and King wasn’t planning to speak at all that night. But when civil rights activist and Baptist minister Ralph Abernathy called upon him, King got out of bed and made his way to Mason Temple.
He spoke without notes. The speech , like so many of his, was meant to energize his audience, to fortify them for a fight, to prepare them to make a sacrifice, if necessary, for something bigger and more important than themselves. Here, he was raging against a citywide injunction to block their planned protest.
“If I lived in China or even Russia, or any totalitarian country,” King said, “maybe I could understand some of these illegal injunctions. Maybe I could understand the denial of certain basic First Amendment privileges, because they hadn’t committed themselves to that over there. But somewhere I read of the freedom of assembly. Somewhere I read of the freedom of speech. Somewhere I read of the freedom of press. Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest for right. And so just as I say we aren’t going to let dogs or water hoses turn us around, we aren’t going to let any injunction turn us around. We are going on.”
Somewhere I read?
Why isn’t King saying that he read it in the U.S. Constitution? While it may have been a rhetorical twist, I suspect he sought to make the point that these values are so obvious, so bedrock, that their source need not be named.
In the decades since King’s speech, one might assume those values have only seeped further into the American ethos—that their presence in the Constitution is less an active safeguard of our rights than evidence of a cherished cultural and political inheritance.
The Constitution mattered, of course, but what mattered more was that its promises were worth standing up for, even when they had been broken.
But today, the context of the speech is impossible to ignore. As Abernathy listened to it, he grew worried. He’d heard King speak hundreds if not thousands of times, but never like this, with tears in his eyes, utterly spent, looking as if he might collapse.
King said to his audience that he didn’t know how much longer he would be with them. He was the recipient of persistent death threats, including one received that very morning, when someone had threatened to blow up his plane to Memphis. But he was glad to be alive and committed to engaging in the struggle for freedom. He was willing to die in the struggle if necessary.
“And so, I’m happy tonight. I’m not worried about anything. I’m not fearing any man! Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!”
He would be killed the very next day.
This was not a man at the very height of his power, bellowing, “I have a dream” to the masses. This was a man who was exhausted, wholly drained, staring down a tragic end for which he likely sensed he was destined. And yet, he was grateful: for the ability to fight in pursuit of rights which, yes, were written on the country’s founding document, but more importantly, which he knew were his birthright, despite having had those rights denied to him and so many others.
Decades later, King’s legacy has helped create a world in which those rights are embedded in our hearts and instincts, just as much as in our Constitution—in large part because he elevated the role of nonviolent protest in American democracy. Most of us today don’t need to read of these rights to know they exist; they live in the air we breathe.
Of course, they still face challenges. As we know all too well, judges might issue unjust injunctions. Police might use violence to silence dissent. Elected leaders might trample the rights they swore to uphold. But we can fight back, King said; indeed we must. We must remind those in possession of power that protest is a form of patriotism, that protesters risk their lives for democracy, for love of our country, for the rights of all, not for some. King’s words inspire us to look not to some blinkered vision of the American past but to the more perfect union that lies ahead. He was in Memphis to do just that, because he understood even more fully than our founders that all men are created equal.
What does this demonstrate, if not that it’s insufficient for our rights to be written in the Constitution—that they must be lived and reinforced and fought for?
Tomorrow, we mark Martin Luther King Jr. Day by remembering the great legacy King left behind. But while we should remember the man at the pinnacle of his influence, it’s equally important to remember who he was on the second-to-last day of his life: exhausted, vilified, facing a country that had turned on him, yet one he believed in anyway. The Constitution mattered, of course, but what mattered more was that its promises were worth standing up for, even when they had been broken.
How do we act in our most vulnerable moments? How do we act when our country has let us down? Fifty-eight years ago, King reminded us that he still had a dream, a dream he had read of, a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. And he wasn’t ever going to give up on it.
Things Worth Remembering will be back in your inbox next Sunday. In case you missed it, last week, Ruth Wisse wrote about  Jacob Glatstein’s 1938 poem, “Good Night, World,” which stunned readers by urging Jews to turn away from a hostile world.
