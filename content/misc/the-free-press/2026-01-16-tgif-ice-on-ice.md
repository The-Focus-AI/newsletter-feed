Welcome back to America’s least funny news roundup. Tickets to the Free Press comedy show (with actually funny people) sold out fast, so for those writing to me: We will host more! Also, if you haven’t been following Arthur Brooks’ new column  here called The Pursuit of Happiness , you really should. I love him. Lastly, thank you for all the slow cooker recipes—I’m working my way through. Happy to report that we made short ribs and they’re phenomenal.
→ No one’s popular anymore: I’m not popular, you’re not popular, neither party is popular. The Democrats have been handed Donald Trump—who spends his days shaking people down , flipping off factory workers , spinning meme coins , and embossing things in gold, like citizenships —and they still have no idea how to win over America. It’s a mystery. Democrats are still putting their political capital behind. . . wait for it. . . arguing that there are no biological differences between men and women in sports (Ketanji Brown Jackson putting up  the good fight this week! Like a Japanese soldier who doesn’t know the war is over.) Here’s the latest from RealClearPolling :
Funny how even after every media company of polite society in America has spent 10 years telling people Republicans are devils, devils we say!, Americans still like Republicans more. Much to mull there. It’s almost as though the mainstream media has lost credibility? Like we’ve fractured into two completely separate information bubbles that no longer intersect at all and someone should do something about that? Ah, reporters are hitting me with brooms. Fine, fine, it is the American people who have lost credibility! From now on every story will be simple. Headline: Trump bad. Story: Trump bad. That will do it.
→ This is dark power: France delayed the G7 Summit—that noble gathering of the seven strongest world leaders, now in its 52nd year—because the White House is double-booked. They’re doing a birthday party  for Trump around then. It’s cage fighting! MMA, guys. America is so powerful on the world stage right now that we can literally postpone the G7 Summit because it conflicts with a cage fight we wanted to plan that week. Désolée. Aw, don’t plan it around us. . . just do it without us. You don’t want to? Oh, okay! We’ll send some dates that work for us. How’s October looking?
→ Leave Jerome Powell alone, you lunatics: Jerome Powell, one of those last vestiges of old Republican dignity, like a scratchy wool sweater, is now speaking directly to cam . Trump’s Department of Justice is threatening a criminal indictment related to the Fed building renovation, and Powell is convinced it’s harassment to get them to lower interest rates. Here’s Powell:
The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.
Hi, Old Republican expert here. When a Bohemian Grove member goes on camera, that is actually a sign of extreme distress and they typically have a heart attack immediately after. Bring a sponge full of gin up to his mouth. (I have no idea which private club Jerome is actually part of, only that I am sure he is part of at least one.)
Trump responded in his way , with his own quiet dignity: “That jerk will be gone soon,” he said. And: “I think it’s fine what I’m doing.” Which is what I tell Bar when she gets mad at my jokes. I think it’s fine what I’m doing. I’m here enjoying my favorite TV show  Whiskey Fridays, as is my American right.
→ War is what I say it is: J.D. Vance said late last week : “The War Powers Act is fundamentally a fake and unconstitutional law.” Well. It is technically real , yes, but my ears are perking up, J.D. I’m interested. Where do we go with this one? All we do now is send drones and tweets. Is that war? When Obama sends one, maybe two, maybe a thousand tiny drones or Marco blows up a weird-looking fishing boat and we fund a revolution, is that war? ¿Como se dice. . . war? Seems more like a video game and a Venmo transfer if you ask me.
→ Abolish the police, except in Iran: As protests for freedom continue in Iran, the ayatollah’s brutal regime is responding by gunning down thousands of protesters. Are there marches here to stand in solidarity? No. Is our freedom all entwined? Again no. So how is the American progressive establishment treating this? Well, they’re either saying it’s fake or they’re saying it’s great. The chair of the DNC says America is just as repressive : “If comparing the U.S. to Iran makes you angry, ask why,” says Ken Martin. Leftist influencer Hasan Piker defended himself  against critics: “You liked a Khamenei tweet when he is responsible for killing so many people? Listen, sometimes you can find poetry in the strangest places.” And sometimes you find terror apologia exactly where you expect. Scores of Scottish independence social media accounts went dark  after Iran instituted an internet blackout. Meaning, when Iran shut down the Iranian internet, suddenly a lot of anti-government protest accounts in other places went dark too. Odd. And then the chef’s kiss is this treatise from Progressive International . In short: Police are meanies, except in Iran, where they are very very good. Here’s Progressive International:
In the imperial countries, the police function as the domestic arm of the empire. They suppress dissent, criminalize resistance, and enforce accumulation through violence particularly against Black, Indigenous, and other Peoples of Color. . . . In Iran, the Law Enforcement Command exists within a radically different context: a state born of popular revolution, subjected to decades of sanctions, assassinations, sabotage, and overt military threats. Crucially, it faces sustained attempts at regime change operations and color revolution tactics aimed at disarming the state internally by delegitimizing its capacity to maintain order.
They have such newfound respect for maintaining order. Hot. They’re all for abolishing the police until the police is named Ayatollah, and then it’s like, “Come beat me, Ayatollah.”
→ Groyper Occupied Government: Our government social media accounts are posting content that I can describe only as playing footsie with old Nazi slogans. Actually, at this point we could call it dry humping. The Department of Labor posted the phrase  “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage” with a cool video. Me, I prefer it in the original German: “Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer.” Translated: One People, One Realm, One Leader. Kind of a similar ring, isn’t it? Like Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” and Marvin Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up.” There’s some copyright infringement here. Probably it’s in my head. Or otherwise it’s definitely a joke, just a goofball Hitler joke. For sure.
→ Americans largely do not believe the ICE shooting was justified: A few stats from a new Quinnipiac University Poll :
57 percent of voters disapprove of the way ICE is enforcing immigration laws
53 percent think the shooting of Renee Good was not justified, while only 35 percent think it was justified
When I think about what the Trump administration is doing with these ICE raids, the only explanation that makes sense is that fear and panic and viral videos are the goal—since it’ll ostensibly discourage immigration and make life so stressful for existing immigrants that they’ll self-deport. Though I don’t think this video  of an ICE agent slipping on ice was one of the ideas laid out in the ICE social marketing sync. Almost worse than the fall itself is the unfortunately perfect symmetry of him getting taken out by ice. Anyway, I do think all the noise and chaos is part of their plan (am I QAnon now?). For a window into ICE officer recruitment, you have to read this hilarious  Slate  story : “You’ve Heard About Who ICE Is Recruiting. The Truth Is Far Worse. I’m the Proof.”
And did you know that in California, for example, being an immigrant is, by law, an argument for a more lenient sentence? Here’s this : “The prosecution, in the interests of justice, and in furtherance of the findings and declarations of Section 1016.2, shall consider the avoidance of adverse immigration consequences in the plea negotiation process as one factor in an effort to reach a just resolution.”
I just. . . there has to be a middle ground between terrorizing immigrants and no jail if criminal is an immigrant. There must be. . . something in between those two outcomes. Call me a kook but I still dream a dream.
→ Credit card interest rate cap: Trump announced last week  that he plans to cap credit card interest rates at 10 percent for one year, a move that pleases the populists on the left and right. And me! And it’s a move that pleases America’s worried neolib moms. Why? Because credit card debt is terrible! Do not get in it! Now, sure, it would probably take an act of Congress to cap credit card interest rates like that, but let’s say Trumpolina achieves his goal. I’m for it. Yes, it would effectively ban lots of people from having credit cards, since banks would just stop offering credit to super high-risk individuals. Good. Sometimes, when people are as dumb as they are, we need a nanny state. (Ow! Nick Gillespie  just threw a loaf of bread at me!) Listen, friends, libertarians, capitalists, there is an army of Americans who are putting purses on credit cards and use Apple Pay just to hear that fun sound and then get too scared to look at the statements and think it all might go away. I say: No credit card for you. Give it to me right now. President Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren are apparently teaming up  to say “Young lady, show me your Klarna account right now.” Girl, lemme see that Klarna.
→ Leave your children alone: Millennial Americans are spending far too much time  with their children.
Leave them alone! They do not need your millennial-addled mind around for all those hours. What are you even talking about? The story of the first time you had rosemary in a cocktail? It wasn’t good the first 10 times you told it. Go outside! Let those kids bumble around in private. . . they still see you in the crack of the door. Nice try, crawling into the air vent. Fine, you can sit in your car in the driveway if you must.
→ Inflation, really funny: Inflation is in a very good place right now. But the mainstream media is doing everything it can to make it sound tragic. Under Biden it was good, fine, improving, overstated. Here are some CNN headlines (highlighted by  Daily Wire  editor Cabot Phillips ):
I just love this game. Actually, let’s keep playing it. It’s either things are terrible but they are secretly getting better or, things are good, but this is why they’re actually horrible.
→ Scott Adams obits: Here’s how Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert and then conservative radio personality, was memorialized in the paper of record.
Here was the headline of their Joseph Stalin obit : “Stalin Rose From Czarist Oppression to Transform Russia Into Mighty Socialist State.”
The NYT obit for Qassim Suleimani, commander of Iran’s Quds Force : “Qassim Suleimani, Master of Iran’s Intrigue, Built a Shiite Axis of Power in Mideast.”
Good thing Stalin and Suleimani didn’t do anything really awful. Like make a racist comment on a podcast.
I wonder what mine will say. . . Nellie Bowles, whose little comic news column TGIF was mean and bad, has died, and not a moment too soon. 
Need a break? Here’s our resident cartoonist David Mamet with this week’s mysterious beauty:
→ California wealth tax to kill the golden goose: In California the push is on for a new wealth tax on billionaires. It’s a one-time 5 percent tax on their total wealth. We might not care about the fate of the billies, but once the California government gets access to total wealth versus just income, you know they won’t stop. Here’s a deeper explanation and a graphic  that shows rockets leaving California. The result, not surprisingly, is that some of California’s estimated 200 to 250 billionaires want to get out of Dodge . So the tax, even if it passed, might not collect much actual money. And it would cost the state a lot: Between 40 and 50 percent of the state’s income tax comes from  the top 1 percent. So you can scare ’em out. Definitely. But then your community aid collective is going to be doing a lot more than delivering fresh lemongrass tea to the neighbors. Like, I know you think that after the revolution, your job will be tarot card reader. But what about bathroom cleaner at a socialized crackhouse? Better charge up those pyrite and jade crystals, honey, because they are going to be working overtime.
→ FBI raids WaPo reporter home: The FBI raided  Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson’s home, as part of an investigation into a Pentagon contractor who allegedly absconded with classified documents. The FBI took Hannah’s computer (work and personal!) and a Garmin watch, interestingly. We stand with Hannah, because journalists and unhinged leakers are a symbiotic system. But the government had a warrant, and I’m not going to go to the mat yet until I know what these documents say exactly (like if they say, here’s where soldier Todd Toddson lives and these are pictures of his children, then I’ll feel differently than if they say, we do the torture with the cattle prod to the balls like so). I’m giving it a beat before I go wild here. So is WaPo owner Jeff Bezos, who has yet to weigh in. The tone of the coverage  around that seems a touch histrionic, just a hair:
→ Havana syndrome is real: And we bought the thing that did it! Yes, it turns out that those silly diplomats and other government personnel who said their horrible headaches and permanent health issues were the product of foul play might have been on to something, according to a new CNN report . Apparently the Department of Homeland Security bought it, and the device produces radio waves. Which sounds a little like what a Venezuelan security guard supposedly described being used by the American military  during the Maduro raid: “It was like a very intense sound wave. Suddenly I felt like my head was exploding from the inside. We all started bleeding from the nose. Some were vomiting blood. We fell to the ground, unable to move.” One of the original Havana syndrome victims gave CNN a perfect statement: “The CIA owes all the victims a fucking major and public apology for how we have been treated as pariahs.” I can’t remember if denying Havana syndrome was a right- or left-wing thing, but I want you to find your nearest conspiracy theorist and give them a hug tonight. And then turn to your right and give your other conspiracy theorist neighbor a hug. In my case, it means hugging myself. Which I was actually already doing because that’s my resting position these days. Anyway—call me a genius but I knew there was something fishy about those radio wave–induced headaches. If you’re in the market for a new conspiracy theory, may I introduce  you to:
My verdict: Yes.
→ Charlie Kirk was a time traveler? Even I draw the line at certain conspiracy theories. That’s why Candace Owens is so helpful, because she reminds me I’m actually not crazy—she is! Her latest is that Charlie Kirk was a time traveler . “Why did Charlie Kirk think he was a time traveler? He said, as I showed you in earlier messages, that he was a time traveler and he had to find me. . . . And again, not anything that I would have placed so much emphasis on back when he was saying it, but it came to fruition. The other parts. . . . I’m totally occupied by this. I tell you, I read these messages and I’m going,, what is this, what is reality, actually?” She alleges that there were “agents” who had Charlie Kirk “monitored. . . since he was young.” What is reality even, Candy? Actually, don’t answer that.
→ Chicago is actually really funny now: Chicago officials tried to quietly approve a $25 million property tax increase , then launched an investigation into how a reporter found out. But the bigger issue is that Chicago schools apparently can raise hundreds of millions through a loophole without ever asking voters to approve it.
→ News of the Jews: How are things going? Well, the FBI says the accused arsonist of the Beth Israel synagogue in Jackson, Mississippi, Spencer Pittman, referred to it as the “synagogue of Satan ,” a right-wing phrase employed by such luminaries as our Candy Owens. And an “approved” fundraiser for the ICE agent who killed Renee Good included the phrase  “anti-American traitors like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (who is Jewish),” a parenthetical that was later quietly deleted. Megyn Kelly—whose book I loved and whose new Groyper makeover makes me so sad, I weep, I tear out my hair—made a big thing of donating to that particular campaign. And here’s Matt Gaetz  this week on One America News blaming wildfires in Argentina on Israelis for some reason: “Are these intentional fires in Argentina part of a globalist master plan to create a new Jewish ethnostate in the Americas? Or are they started by garden-variety bandits who are just trying to steal land?”
Late last week, a crowd gathered outside a Queens synagogue and chanted: “Say it loud, say it clear, we support Hamas here.” Zohran Mamdani initially stayed silent, then said in a statement  that the language was “wrong” and has “no place in New York City.” I’m sure. He was probably busy fighting for a bidet to be installed in the mayoral abode, an “aspirational hope,” he’s said, which feels suspiciously European even if I technically agree with him. “We’ll see if we can get it done,” he said with gusto, and the strength of his ancestors at his back. Maybe he got the idea while washing up in Steve Spielberg’s bathroom, after their private dinner  at the director’s NYC apartment this week. Maybe if one of the “cool Jews” talks to him, we can fix this mess, Spielberg was probably thinking. And the UAE has reportedly cut back government-funded scholarships for their young people to attend UK universities, citing fears that students could be radicalized  by Muslim Brotherhood-linked Islamists on British campuses. That’s for real. They don’t want their youth joining hotheaded religious sects and so they keep them away from London. It’s perfect. Saudi Arabia is more lowkey than Shoreditch.
→ I love my new social housing, thank you, Cea: Cea Weaver, director of the New York City Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants, wants to make all housing social housing. Here she is outlining her dream  back in 2021: “The housing is owned by a collective and people are paying 30 percent of their income in order to live in their housing. If your income is zero, you pay zero. If your income is $500,000 a year, you’re paying 30 percent of that. And the government is providing—is the sort of owner, or not even owner, the government doesn’t even have to be the owner—but the government is what’s making all of that works in cash flows.” Communism is amazing, isn’t it? I love how well it works in all those places where this has worked. The best part about this is if too many people get upset, we’ll all have to sit through another news cycle about how Cea, who is my age, is actually a tiny baby and in 2021 she was barely crawling. How unfair can you people be? She’s a child, for heaven’s sake, let her do one tiny communist revolution! My god. Can a girl have a freakin’ childhood?!
→ Download the Are You Dead app! A morbidly named Chinese app originally called “Are You Dead?” has gone viral  by requiring users, many of them young and living alone, to check in daily or risk alerting their emergency contact. I feel like being asked every day if I’m dead would sort of drive me insane. Are you dead? What about today? Now? Dead yet?. . . Really? Still not? Wow. Some real commitment.
→ Free Kiefer: CBS News is out of control . This is offensive. This is wrong.  If Kiefer punched the driver, the driver deserved it and we should give Kiefer some privacy. And maybe even a GoFundMe that says “Kiefer Sutherland (who is awesome).” I’m calling Bari right now.
