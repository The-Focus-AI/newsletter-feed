The semi-truck backed directly into the building, crunching some of the office’s beige paint into crumbs. With some precarious maneuvering from the driver, a laid-back man named Vincent, the 7,000 pound delivery was ready to be unloaded. After 23 years of hauling cargo, he said this was his weirdest shipment.
“What’re you guys doing with a million pennies?” Vincent asked.
We were at the headquarters of Impulse Labs, a startup that has set out to develop a high-tech stove  that boils water in seconds. In that moment, the lab’s founder, Sam D’Amico, along with his buddies, Will Stoeckle and Coleman Collins, became the proud owners of one million pennies. They were going to put them back into circulation.
Well, sort of.
Pennies and their precious copper are worth more in materials than their face value as currency. This is part of the reason the U.S. decided to cease production of the Abe Lincoln-celebrating discs. Our trio of tech enthusiasts embraced the penny’s demise as an opportunity. They chose to launch—in their words—an over-collateralized stable memecoin.
In the tradition of the antiquated but beloved gold standard, they’ve decided to back a cryptocurrency with one million physical pennies. One penny equals one token.
More simply, it’s a group of dudes who can drop $10,000 on a joke.
“In cryptocurrency, there’s stablecoins called Tether and they’re sort of famously opaque,” Stoeckle, who works at the AI robotics start-up Physical Intelligence, explained. “Tether for a long time had this famous controversy where it’s really unclear what’s backing it. And then you have memecoins. And so I thought they can be a beautiful merge of these two things because you can say, ‘Look, we’re making a stablecoin,’ which for legal disclaimer, it absolutely is not. But it’s backed one to one, not by a dollar, but by a penny.”
On a sunny Saturday morning in San Francisco, their plan finally came together. The doors to the delivery truck opened revealing… an underwhelming sight. The roughly 20-foot trailer appeared empty, all but three pallets in the far back. The bricks of pennies laid in rough stacks, some toppled over. They came in $25 blocks, weighing 15 pounds each. One million pennies looked more like a Costco food run.
D’AMICO AND his friends aren’t crypto people. They work in physical industry startups: stovetops, robotics, quantum computing. They’re used to hard problems with real constraints “We’re all masochists,” Stoeckle joked. A crypto token is worth just about as much as a defunct currency to this crew—whatever can be salvaged for the bit.
From November, when the very last penny was produced in Philadelphia, to January, when the one million pennies landed on D’Amico’s doorstep, the team got to work and hatched their plan. At first, they tried going to banks and buying bricks of pennies one by one. When the banks’ sources dried up, Stoeckle got in touch with a supplier called Coinwrap.
“The broker I bought them from…she’s probably 60 [years old] and pounds Miller Lights,” Stoeckle said. Maryanne from upstate New York was able to sell the team the pennies they needed. The papers were signed, and Vincent was deployed from the southern California town of Pico Rivera to San Francisco with one million pennies.
The delivery was a family affair. D’Amico’s sister cooked up an egg on the Impulse Labs stove for her toddlers. Collins and Stoeckle gently ushered their own children away from the moving dolly stacked high with coins. After two hours, the truck was empty, and the penny bricks were stacked into a makeshift throne. We took turns sitting on the $10,000.
“We’ll melt this down into NVLink Interconnect. It’ll be worth money,” D’Amico quipped.
BY THE end of the weekend, CENT was minted on the blockchain and a dedicated website was launched. Fortcent , a play on Fort Knox, features a “live reverse status” to track the pennies and a fancy whitepaper  that explains the whole idea.
“Here’s a funny thing about money: most of it is invisible. The dollars in your bank are entries in a database. The reserves backing your stablecoins are described in PDFs you’ll never read, audited by firms you’ve never heard of, stored in jurisdictions chosen for their opacity,” the site reads. “We thought it would be interesting to try the opposite. What if you could literally see the money? What if ‘proof of reserves’ meant pointing a camera at a pile of coins and saying ‘look, there they are’?”
“It’s a little absurd. We know. That’s part of the point.”
As of this writing, people are actually buying into the bit. At about a penny per token. But according to Solscan, there’s only been a handful of small transactions. It remains a rather siloed adventure for a few lads in the only city that will tolerate such antics.
“The downside’s low,” Stoeckle said. “God forbid, we could just take the pennies back to a bank.”
