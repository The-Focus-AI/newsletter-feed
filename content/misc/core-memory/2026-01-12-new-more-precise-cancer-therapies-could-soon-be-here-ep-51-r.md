We have a guest host and some breaking news for this episode.
Eryney Marrogi , the scientist and soon-to-be doctor who writes for us now and again, has taken over the pod studio to interview Richard Fuisz . Earlier today, Marrogi broke a story  on Fuisz’s company Nonfiction Labs , which has developed technology that could make it possible to use magnets to better control how cancer therapies are doled out in the body.
The two big brains get into Nonfiction’s technology and into Fuisz’s rather prolific work at the cutting-edge of the biotech field. The conversation goes into how biotech actually gets built, competition with China and Fuisz’s family legacy of invention (his grandfather was the prolific inventor featured in “Bad Blood”).
