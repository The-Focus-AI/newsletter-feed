In August of 2021, the Biden administration held an electric vehicle summit and decided not to invite Tesla or Elon Musk. At the time, I remember thinking that Biden had just made an enemy for life, although I underestimated the extent to which Musk’s rage would flow. (Which was dumb. I wrote a biography on the man and, of all people, should know to never underestimate Musk, especially if he takes something personally.)
Musk had every right to be pissed. Tesla had created the electric vehicle industry more or less out of nothing and established the US as the leader in the field. For the first time in a very long while, the US auto industry had some excitement around it and hope for the future. Biden rewarded all of this by holding GM up as the top American electric vehicle automaker and praised the company for “electrifying the entire automotive industry.”
Politicians lie all the time, and Biden wanted to cozy up with the unionized automakers. But his statements were so untrue as to make the whole summit farcical. Musk, of course, channeled his anger into an all-out assault on Biden and the Democratic Party, and we’re all living with the consequences.
(Life is so weird. Let’s remember that in October of 2012 Mitt Romney called Tesla “a loser” during a presidential debate with Obama. Republicans hated that Tesla had received a Department of Energy loan ($465 million) in 2010. They hated that Tesla was a green tech company. They hated Musk. Less than a decade later, we ended up with Biden giving the finger to Musk and Tesla.)
Outside of this drama, the Biden Snub put something of a target on GM’s back. If GM was meant to be out there “electrifying the entire automotive industry,” then it kind of sort of needed to be out there “electrifying the entire automotive industry.” As such, I made a recent trip to Detroit to see what exactly GM has been up to.
GM has more than a dozen EV models today, ranging from small cars to massive trucks. GM let us test out one of these massive trucks during our visit in the form of a GMC Sierra , and I have to say it was quite awesome. The truck had 500 miles of range, the Super Cruise autopilot technology, tons of room and some nice polish. (As someone who laughed hysterically when GM came out with the EV Hummer – overcompensate much? – I had to eat crow here.)
Naturally, we rewarded GM’s goodwill by wrapping the truck in Brex logos because the loaner agreement didn’t seem to have a clause prohibiting this.
GM, as you’ll see in the main video up top, has also invested billions and billions of dollars into battery research and battery manufacturing. It’s starting with innovations at the elemental level and going all the way up to battery packs and then final assembly.
I’d long assumed that GM depended on battery partners like LG Energy Solutions and Samsung SDI for most of the advances here. But I came away impressed at the work GM does itself. We met with about 20 or so scientists who walked us through their efforts to make batteries cheaper, better and safer. These were world-engineers with rather fantastic labs at their disposal.
GM is most excited  at the moment about LMR or Lithium Manganese-Rich batteries. These batteries up the manganese content from their predecessors, and this brings some pros and cons. Manganese is relatively cheap, so the price of the batteries comes down, but it’s less energy dense, so the range of the final vehicles will also be lower for the moment. GM, though, contends that the tradeoff is ideal for the American market. Consumers want lower priced EVs, and they’ll still be getting vehicles with 300-mile+ range.
The investment in its R&D centers has helped put GM at the lead with LMR technology. And the hope has been that LMR helps US automakers gain an edge over Chinese automakers, who have remained committed to Lithium Iron Phosphate technology. (The US, of course, pioneered the Lithium Iron Phosphate tech only to see China master it, and the same will likely hold true with LMR in due course.)
GM’s efforts have turned it into a major EV player. Tesla accounts for about 43 percent of US electric vehicle sales with GM coming in as the clear number two at 14 percent. Ford, Hyundai and Volkswagen sit around 6 percent each.
All has not been going great, though. Trump has yanked the EV rebates and loosened environmental restrictions on the auto industry. And Americans still are not buying EVs in the quantities that GM and others hoped. GM, in fact, just recorded  a $7.1 billion loss tied, in large part, to write-downs of the value of its EV assembly lines and battery factories. Guh.
GM tells me it remains committed to EVs for the long haul. It, in fact, is attempting to bring every part of EV manufacturing from the mines to the assembly lines to the US. (I believe the intention while remaining skeptical on the execution. But let’s see.)
As for the Great Biden Snub? Well, Kamala Harris  and GM’s own Mary Barra  are still trying to do damage control. And, well, the world and its political order will never quite be the same apparently.
Anyway. Enjoy the video!
