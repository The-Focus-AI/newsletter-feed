Biohacking has gone through a lot of different phases. Implanting an NFC chip in your hand is old school and having a blood boy is passé. Among Silicon Valley’s 20-somethings, all the cool kids have a peptide stack.  
Jasmine Sun joins us this week to chat about all things peptides. She was previously a product manager at Substack, but now she writes about San Francisco culture on her own Substack . Jasmine recently published a deep dive  in The New York Times about the trendy injectable and deets on the Chinese peptide rave (which you first read about from our new writer, Kylie Robison, last month ).

Do you feel old yet? We do. 
In this episode, we get into all the important bits: What are peptides, why are they Chinese, and how is RFK Jr. involved? This is not medical advice, but if you do inject some peptides after this episode, tag us.
The Core Memory podcast is on all major platforms and on our YouTube channel over here . If you enjoy the show, please leave a review and tell your friends.
Our show is sponsored by Brex . It builds finance tech that makes expensing and accounting for things like peptides super easy, if your company is cool with such things. 
Like thousands of ambitious, innovative companies, we run on Brex so we can spend smarter and move faster. And you can too. Learn more at www.brex.com/corememory 
The podcast is also made possible by E1 Ventures , which backs the most ambitious founders (probably some peptide users) and start-ups.
