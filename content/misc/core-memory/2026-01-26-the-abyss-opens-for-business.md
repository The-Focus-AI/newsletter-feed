In 2021, a remotely controlled vehicle set out to probe a darkness billions of years old, streaming a camera feed up to Dr. Andrew Sweetman and his team huddled aboard the Maersk Launcher. The Welsh scientist advised his colleagues to keep their eyes locked on the screen, for even a single moment away could mean missing a creature no human had ever seen before.
The researchers had company, in an almost literal sense. There were business interests onboard. And what united the suits and the scientists in this moment wasn’t the prospect of spotting new life, but studying the inanimate. After all, the objects found down here, thousands of meters deep, have the potential to change the economics of an entire industry or two and alter the political landscape between the U.S. and China.
Beneath the brittle stars and gummy squirrels  of the ocean’s abyssal zone lie a vast expanse of fist-sized rocks, called polymetallic nodules. Though found across many ocean basins, the richest deposit of nodules exists in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 1.7 million square-mile stretch of Pacific seafloor that, thanks to the nodules, contains more nickel, manganese, and cobalt than the entire terrestrial reserve base .
If Dr. Sweetman cared about the CCZ’s economic implications, he didn’t show it. Three years after his voyage into the zone, his team published evidence revealing that the unique metallic composition of these nodules creates oxygen, a process formerly believed to be possible only through photosynthesis . The presence of “dark oxygen ” would raise new questions about where aerobic life began on Earth and even where we might find species beyond our planet. In other words, a big deal.
This discovery and the reaction that followed highlighted the tension and complexity that surround the nodule riches within the CCZ. The Maersk Launcher is owned by The Metals Company (TMC), a NASDAQ-listed venture seeking to harvest these nodules for the critical minerals and rare earths they contain. As part of their mandate to explore and possibly mine the seafloor, TMC must hire scientists like Dr. Sweetman to conduct independent research. But what those scientists publish can impact where, when, or if private companies can extract resources from the last remaining part of the Earth that no one owns. Not long after Dr. Sweetman released his research, TMC issued a rebuttal  refuting the “dark oxygen” findings altogether.
These scientific debates run alongside legal squabbles that are moving too slowly for industry or the U.S. government to tolerate. There’s a growing fleet of commercial, nodule-harvesting ships currently operating on exploration licenses granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a quasi-UN body that regulates all oceanic mining activities beyond national jurisdiction. Since 1994, the Jamaica-based group has been tasked with writing laws for its 170 Member States, but has yet to formalize any official guidelines  on whether or when nodule farming can proceed in earnest.
The United States is one of the few countries excluded from this list. Instead, the US issues licenses  on its own terms. Exactly what this regulatory conflict means for deep-sea mining has remained largely a gray area. But as the trade war with China  escalates and demand for minerals grows, private companies are itching to deploy at a commercial scale. Amid these pressures, the US has forged ahead with plans to extract polymetallic nodules, international regulations be damned.
The Metals Company is the dominant player in the deep-sea mining industry, but an upstart called Impossible Metals is attempting to corner the market with less ecological intrusion. Both have submitted commercial operation requests to the United States last year after President Trump signed an executive order to unleash offshore resource extraction .
These mining companies present themselves as the lower-impact alternative to extracting the minerals critical to electrification via more traditional methods on land. They don’t need to tear up the Earth by excavating vast mines or subject people to labor in horrendous conditions. They must simply harvest the nodules sitting right atop the ocean floor. To critics, they’re trading one environmental catastrophe for another.
What they discover in the coming years will have profound scientific impacts for one of the least studied ecosystems on Earth. They will also answer the burning question of who actually owns the riches of the planet’s last frontier: humanity, or whoever gets there first?
IMPOSSIBLE METALS’ story begins in 2020 on an inauspicious lockdown day, when wildfires reddened the Bay Area’s sky, and Oliver Gunasekara sat indoors thinking about electrification. The British businessman was looking for a new venture after a career spent in semiconductors, and he figured that supplying the raw materials for battery manufacturers was a sound idea.
Terrestrial mining is an ecological and often ethically fraught process, contributing to biodiversity loss, pollution, and human rights abuses . Gunaskera was intrigued by a potential alternative found where few beings live and no country owns: the bottom of the ocean. The polymetallic nodules lying there formed over millions of years, as nickel, copper, manganese, cobalt, and other rare earths crystallized around something small, like a piece of basalt or a shark tooth . The nodules lie atop or are partially buried across the abyssal plains of the world’s oceans, where sedimentation is slow, and life unfolds in complete darkness.
Surprisingly little has changed about how polymetallic nodules are extracted since they were discovered in 1875 by the HMS  Challenger  as it dredged its way across the Pacific. The process is often likened to picking up golf balls on a driving range, but the reality is something closer to UFO abduction via vacuum.
Take TMC, which uses collector vehicles to comb the seafloor in rows. These machines shoot jets of water to pop nodules up, suck them into a pipe, and hydraulically pump their haul miles back up for separation on deck. The hoovered nodules are then sailed to shore for processing, while everything else is dumped back through a return pipe at about 2,000 meters beneath the surface . Left behind: roughly 10 percent  of the nodules and tire tracks etched across the sediment.
This approach does not make many traditional environmentalists happy. Besides altering a habitat scientists practically just discovered, the vacuuming method generates billowing sediment plumes  that scientists think may be harmful  for ocean ecology. Research published last year found that these far-reaching plumes can impact tiny organisms like zooplankton and cascade their way up to disrupt commercial fisheries .
Thirty-seven countries have now called for a moratorium  on deep-sea mining until its impacts are better understood, with France’s ocean minister even characterizing TMC’s plan as “environmental piracy .” Gerard Barron, Chairman & CEO of The Metals Company, believes these groups are ignoring data his company has been gathering for many years.
“They’re trying to create a narrative to suit their purpose of resistance,” Barron said last year on our podcast . “And it’s disingenuous at best. We’ve always said, ‘Let the data set you free.’ We ourselves have gathered more than one petabyte of environmental data since we’ve been at it. And there is an enormous amount known about this part of the ocean floor.”
Gunaskera doesn’t think much of the calls for a moratorium either, suggesting that some countries backing the opposition are trying to protect their terrestrial mining interests. But he takes the environmental concerns seriously. “It seemed to me in the 21st century we could do better than the dredging tractor,” Gunasekara says.
Impossible Metals doesn’t just believe they can mine without the terrestrial headache, but that they can ditch sediment plumes altogether by building the world’s largest mining company without digging at all.
IN EVOLUTIONARY THEORY, the term carcinization  refers to biology’s repeated inclination to build crab-like bodies. Though the concept is somewhat of a joke, Impossible Metals may just be proving that the theory holds true for mining technology too. Their Eureka Collection System is a line of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) that will pick up polymetallic nodules one by one with claws, thereby reducing the amount of sediment kicked up and eliminating the portion deposited back in plumes.
Impossible Metals’ AUV uses a computer vision system narrowly programmed to identify only the seafloor and polymetallic nodules. The result is oddly expansive: everything else is classified as living, whether that be a carnivorous sponge , a submarine cable, or a plastic bag.
If it detects “life,” it will quarantine the area and hover above it. Otherwise, it will begin to rapidly claw nodules and deposit them in an onboard container—no umbilical tether necessary. The AUV will adjust for the excess weight by releasing water from its spheres to maintain buoyancy and leave once it attains its four metric ton payload within its four-hour mission time. In an effort to have as small an impact as possible, Gunasekera points out that “by default [the collectors] leave 60 percent of the nodules undisturbed.”
Despite their commitment to minimal ecological intrusion, Impossible Metals has failed to convince hardcore environmentalists of their mission. Last April, the company submitted its request to start exploring and mining in the deep sea off the coast of American Samoa  and immediately drew the ire of Greenpeace  and community members insulted by the company’s one percent pledge of profits  to the territory. It appears hard to be liked in the deep-sea mining business.
IF THERE is a theme to the burgeoning industries of the 2020s, it’s perhaps the simple fact that regulation struggles to keep pace with technological progress. In the decades of its existence, the ISA has yet to agree on a definitive rulebook on how to monitor and regulate deep-sea mining . During that same time, private companies have turned experimental technology into commercial-ready ventures. In the background, countries like the US are desperate to escape China’s mineral supply dominance just as a new wave of industrialization accelerates demand, driven by  electrification, defense manufacturing, and steel production.
“The ISA has a very difficult job to do,” Dr. Sweetman says, noting that it’s a tough task to get so many countries to agree on something, especially with added pressure from the US. But in his opinion, the urgency with which companies like TMC and Impossible Metals speak of is partly driven by investors and their timeline, not necessarily what’s best for the CCZ’s environment or the health of the planet as a whole.
At the heart of the deep-sea mining debate is a larger cultural clash about the green energy transition. Gunasekera and Barron brand themselves as a new form of environmentalist, the type that wants to electrify economies but recognizes that some amount of mining is necessary. Simply put, mining comes with a cost, and their pitch is to extract with as little disruption as possible.
At face value, mining a fraction of a vast seafloor for electrification resources seems like a sound plan, especially considering that the ISA already protects 40 percent of the CCZ  from any form of commercial activity. But even if polymetallic nodules could be harvested with minimal environmental consequences, the extent to which this new industry will impact terrestrial mining is unclear. This is because the mineral composition of batteries is evolving as companies innovate new ways to store energy, potentially making these new ventures much ado about nothing.
Given that polymetallic nodules take millions of years to form, the cost of making irreversible decisions is steep, and it’s easy to mischaracterize the ecological value of the CCZ. Focusing on its low biomass , as the mining companies tend to do, hides the region’s high levels of biodiversity or other benefits not yet known. “The Galapagos is a low-biomass ecosystem,” Dr. Sweetman mentions. So too is Arctic sea ice. “Yet it is critical for reflecting sunlight back into space and keeping the planet cool… Just because something is a low-biomass ecosystem doesn’t mean we should just destroy it,” he says.
DR. SWEETMAN IS currently leading a 3-year long investigation  to continue his research on dark oxygen, this time backed by universities and scientific institutions rather than mining companies. What the project reveals about the nodules’ role in deep-sea ecosystems could fundamentally alter how the ISA approaches mining regulations, if those regulations wait for the science to complete the picture.
That’s a big if. Mining technology has outpaced both our ecological understanding and the bureaucratic machinery designed to govern it. The ISA’s rulebook remains unfinished, and the one written by the United States is decades old.
What research has been carried out so far in the CCZ reveals an ecosystem unlike anything seen before, with over 5,000 species identified  in the region that are entirely new to science. And because of its low sedimentation rate, whatever is taken or altered will likely remain disrupted for decades at least. (One environmental impact study found that biological disturbances continued 44 years  after nodules were removed, with the imprint of the collector’s tracks still visible on the seabed.)
Dr. Sweetman is neither for nor against deep-sea mining. He recognizes that we may have to decide to mine the CCZ, but wants that decision to be based on the best environmental research teams like his can get. “I don’t think we scientists and NGOs can continually say ‘we don’t know enough,’” he says. “Eventually we’re going to have to say, with all the information that we have, are we able to do this in as environmentally sustainable a way as we can, or is this going to be a complete and utter disaster?”
