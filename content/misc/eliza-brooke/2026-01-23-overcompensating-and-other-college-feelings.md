To my D.C. Scumblettes: I’m moderating a Q&A with director Simón Mesa Soto at a special advance screening of his new film, A Poet , at the AFI Silver Theatre on February 5. Get your tickets today  and come say hi!
To quote the song that plays, somewhat incongruously, during the trailer for Joachim Trier’s Sentimental Value: “I WISH! THAT! I KNEW WHAT I KNOW NOW. / WHEN I WAS YOUNGER!” (The song is called “Ooh La La ,” by the British band Faces.)
Doesn’t it suck, how you can’t travel back in time and redo your youth with your hard-earned wisdom and emotional depth? Obviously that’s the whole deal with this one wild and precious life — your youthful foolishness is precisely what led to your current wisdom. You’re probably being an idiot right now, and in ten years, you’ll look back and think: Gah! I wish! That! I knew what I know now!
This is your introduction to today’s cartoon, in which the lovely and insightful college comedy Overcompensating  resurfaces  and (maybe) unsticks some long-held feelings I have about my own undergrad experience. I hope you enjoy.
Maybe I will!
Eliza
