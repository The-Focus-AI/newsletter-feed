There is a meme that asks when, exactly, it all went wrong. People point to Reagan and Bush. Some blame the Clinton years and the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Others say it was the destruction of unions. I point to Daniel Pearl .
I do not say this lightly. I am not trying to reopen old wounds for shock value. Pearl’s murder on February 1, 2002 mattered because it was the first major world event that truly lived on the internet first and foremost. Not television. Not newspapers. The internet.
September 11 happened on TV. We watched it together, live, in public places. The wars that followed unfolded on cable news and on front pages. Editors filtered what we saw. Anchors framed it. There were limits, however imperfect.
Pearl’s death crossed a line. He was a journalist investigating extremism in Pakistan. He was murdered on camera. The video was not just documented, it was designed to spread. It moved through forums, email chains, and early websites with no gatekeepers and no shared sense of restraint. This was viral horror before we had a word for it.
That moment showed what the internet was becoming. Always on. Always available. Detached from place, time, and consequence. From that soil grew two competing ways of thinking.
The first believed information should move freely, journalism, art, code, research, all of it. This idea powered early blogging, open source software, and later things like cryptocurrency. It rewarded people who shared work openly, sometimes for money, often not. The faith was simple. If knowledge moved faster, society would improve.
The second way of thinking was darker, what people now call the Dark Pill. It treated the internet as a mask. A place where fear, resentment, and powerlessness could hide behind usernames and avatars. Mostly young men, disconnected and angry, built identities larger than their real lives. They stopped seeing other people as real. Everyone else became background characters.
In that worldview, cruelty was play. Lying was strategy. Nothing was serious because nothing was real. The point was not to build. The point was to provoke, mock, and dominate attention. The earlier belief in shared progress was replaced by a hunger to watch things burn.
Over time, that second mindset proved more aggressive and more contagious. The free software world quietly shaped infrastructure. The dark internet shaped culture. The same impulse that turned Pearl’s execution into online content now drives harassment campaigns, political disinformation, and state violence performed for cameras.
The logic is the same. Flood the space. Shock the audience. Wear people down. From GamerGate to modern Republican politics, from online mobs to ICE raids filmed for intimidation, the tactic never changes. Create fear. Normalize it. Make outrage feel routine.
I think we are near the end of this phase. I do not think it ends gently. Movements like MAGA do not fade out. They exhaust themselves through escalation. The next few years will likely be worse, not better, before the collapse comes.
This is a moment of crisis. A moment when cruelty pretends to be strength. The only real response is refusal. Refusal to accept this as normal. Refusal to treat suffering as content.
Everyone deserved more, Daniel Pearl, George Floyd, Renee Nicole Good , Luis Gustavo Núñez Cáceres , Geraldo Lunas Campos , Alex Pretti , Luis Beltrán Yáñez Cruz .
They were not symbols. They were people. A world that turns their deaths into spectacle is a world that has lost its bearings.
Now, on to the books.
Truffle Hound: On the Trail of the World’s Most Seductive Fungus, with Dreamers, Schemers, and Some Extraordinary Dogs 
By Rowan Jacobsen
Since writing about mushrooms this year, I’ve become fascinated by everything from oysters to Hen of the Woods. This book about truffles was surprisingly readable and enjoyable, a little story about a guy who falls in love with a huge white truffle and wants to find out everything about these endearing little shroomies. He travels to Italy and Croatia and learns everything there is to know about these amazing little morels.
Coffin Moon 
By Keith Rosson
This book was written with a cleaver. Rosson is a great storyteller, and his style leans on literary fiction, while the story he tells — a man trying to avenge his wife’s death at the hands of a vampire — is a bloody romp. It’s a surprising horror book in that it doesn’t feel like a monster story until the monster appears.
Separation of Church and Hate: A Sane Person's Guide to Taking Back the Bible from Fundamentalists, Fascists, and Flock-Fleecing Frauds 
By John Fugelsang
I’ve been reading a few of these lately, and this one basically goes through the ranks of fundamentalists and fascists who are turning our country into a police state. Fugelsang is an interesting and open writer, and this is a readable romp through the rogues’ gallery we’re facing now.
