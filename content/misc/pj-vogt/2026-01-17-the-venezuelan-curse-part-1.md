Hello, and happy Saturday,
A new one for you!
For the past year, there’s been a steady drumbeat of headlines about Venezuela. Now the US has invaded, arrested its president, and put itself in charge of things. To understand how we got here, we talked to Venezuelan historian Alejandro Velasco, who grew up there and has spent years trying to understand why a country with so much promise has proven so difficult to govern.

⁠ Our Forkiverse Experiment Continues
Last week, we here at Search Engine combined with our friends at the podcast Hard Fork to make a very tiny social media website called The Forkiverse . We did this because we are very curious about an alternative form of social media called the fediverse.  
This week, on Hard Fork, I joined Kevin Roose and Casey Newton to discuss the micro-dramas, challenges, and joys of our early days as social media moguls. Check it out here if you’re curious! 
And The Forkiverse itself continues to churn along! Pop in if you want to say hi,  I am continuing to approve new user requests up until the server breaks. So far, so good. So far. 
See you early next week with part two, 
PJ
