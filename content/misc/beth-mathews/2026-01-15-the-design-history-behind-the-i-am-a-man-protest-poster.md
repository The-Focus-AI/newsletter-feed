In the 1960s, Memphis, Tennessee, became home to a large population of African American sharecroppers who had migrated from the deep rural South to more Northern cities in search of a better life. Although discrimination became illegal in 1964 with the Civil Rights Act, discrimination remained deeply embedded in American society. Many of these people found employment in manufacturing and sanitation work in places like Memphis.
Five years after the “I Have a Dream Speech” in February of 1968, 1,300 Black sanitation workers in Memphis, TN, went on strike  for 64 days. These sanitation workers were paid less than their white counterparts, and they were on strike for improved safety standards and the recognition of their union after two Black Memphis garbage collectors, Echol Cole and Robert Walker, were crushed to death by their truck’s trash compactor. Their strike was committed to nonviolent civil disobedience and involved daily marches with the sign “I Am A Man.”
The “I AM A MAN” Phrase
Before Martin Luther King, Jr. arrived in Memphis for the cause, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) dispatched an up-and-coming union official named William Lucy to help the 1,300 striking workers in their struggle. Lucy stated in a conversation with Rutgers , “Our role was to try and do all we could to help them win this effort. During the course of the strike, it became clear that something had to hold this together.” ¹
Working with local minister Rev. James Lawson, Rev. Malcom Blackburn (a white Canadian), Cornelia Crenshaw, and fellow AFSCME member Joe Warren, they created a slogan that was short enough to fit on a placard but strong enough to bring the city together: “I AM A MAN.” 
“We came up with a slogan because across the south, he can go from boy to uncle to grandfather without ever passing the station of being a man.
The sign simply said, in four words, ‘I Am a Man.’ It was the shortest phrase that we could get that would instill in them a sense of pride, not just for what they had done but what they were doing to try to change the system.” ¹
Behind the Poster Design
As mentioned previously, the co-creator of the poster slogan, Rev. Malcom Blackburn, was the local minister at the Clayborn Temple. The Clayborn Temple, with its all-Black congregation, sat in close proximity to Beale Street, downtown, and public housing, making it an ideal location for sanitation workers to meet and organize.² Rev. Blackburn just so happened to run a small printing press in the basement of Clayborn Temple, and it was Blackburn who printed the “I AM A MAN” signs. 
Thanks to the research of type designer Tré Seals  from Vocal Type , a type foundry that develops fonts inspired by minority cultures and protest movements, a chance eBay discovery of a 1960 Hamilton Wood Type catalog revealed the signs typeset in Gothic No. 6243. 
Rev. Blackburn was a journeyman printer, which meant he had completed a printing press apprenticeship, but was a step below a master, and could perform tasks such as setting type and operating a press, making their skill set a perfect match for the Civil Rights movement and the times. 
Blackburn, having completed his apprenticeship, also meant he could join the printing union, Allied Printing Trades Council. 
At the bottom of the poster, we see a logo for the Allied Printing Trades Council in Memphis, TN. This stamp meant that the poster was produced by a union member, Blackburn, to signify fair labor practices. I find this to be an interesting subplot: a white union member using his union membership to support a Black-led strike to have their sanitation union recognized. It is a small detail that reveals the mass discrimination against those who, at the time, could be recognized as union members in 1960s Memphis.
Martin Luther King, Jr. Joins the Cause
On March 18th, Martin Luther King, Jr. joined the cause in Memphis. And on March 28th, King led the strikers on their daily march to the courthouse. The police attacked the marchers after a window to a department store was broken, and they then retreated to the Clayborn Temple, home of the printing press and campaign efforts. The police surrounded the building and the people inside and fired tear gas through the stained-glass windows. As the strikers dispersed throughout Memphis, Larry Page, a 16-year-old boy, was shot by a policeman, and Martin Luther King, Jr. vowed to return to Memphis to hold another march.
On April 8th, 1968, you can see his return, speaking to thousands and delivering one of his most prolific speeches, “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop. ” The next day, he was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel.
Four days after the assassination, Dr. King’s widow, Coretta Scott King, led 42,000 silent marchers through the streets holding copies of a new poster, “Honor King. End Racism!” They marched from the Clayborn Temple to the courthouse, and on April 18th, Memphis Mayor Henry Loeb agreed to the strikers’ demands that Black labor deserved protection.
Carlyle Leach, the donor of this sign, remembers the day his father, Thomas Leach, participated in the rally. Afterwards, Thomas Leach gave his son an extra-long embrace and told him that he and the other marchers walked in complete silence. National Guardsmen held loaded weapons, pointed at the protestors. Mr. Leach told his son he was terrified, but that he knew he was on the right side of justice. He signed and dated the back of the placard, “April 8, 1968, Successful!” - From The New York Public Library Archives 
The Poster Continues Its Influence
As mentioned previously, Tré Seals from Vocal Type  creates typefaces inspired by minority cultures and protest movements. He designed the typeface Martin based on the “I AM A MAN” poster typeface, and you can purchase this typeface.
Here is how I’ve used Martin for today’s protest marches, and you can find a free download of the posters on my website.
As we head into the weekend and celebrate the work of Martin Luther King, Jr. here in the US on Monday, I hope this backstory inspires more efforts toward a just and equitable world.
Love,
Beth
