As I’ve mentioned in previous posts and notes, I love sifting through vintage type specimen books I find on eBay. I boldly claimed to my husband while sitting on the couch studying the Trust-Franklin Press Type Specimen Book, “There are things you can learn in books that you can’t learn anywhere else!” Oh boy. Is this why America is the way it is? But it’s true. There are so many historical pieces that can help inform our current designs. And when I say “historical pieces”, I mean a 12-page mailer from a 1950s printing press found on eBay.
Let’s take a look inside this mailer pamphlet and see what we can learn.
Bank Script
Making my way down the page of the Trust-Franklin Press Type Specimen Book, I saw a typeface called Bank Script. Noted! When I’m designing historically accurate pieces, I want the scripts I use to be authentic to the period. Bank Script was created in 1895 and has been used in official banking documents for over a century.
A fun callout: Notice the numbers next to each typeface title.
This is an early look at the point system. The same one we use today for typeface sizes. The point system comes from metal type, where each size was a physically different block of metal.
