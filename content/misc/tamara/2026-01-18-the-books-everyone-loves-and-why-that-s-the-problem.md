Naming books changes the temperature immediately; it pulls the reader toward agreement or résistance before the argument has had time to settle. So I chose to place the examples and more explanations behind a paywall to protect attention. I wanted the public part of my essay to remain spacious enough for self-recognition rather than reflex, and the private part to allow for slower, more accountable reading. The examples are not a list to consume, but a conversation to enter, and that kind of engagement requires committed eyes and more patience.
You close the book. It has been praised exhaustively. It has been underlined, quoted, canonised. And still, nothing has happened. The sensation resembles sitting through a wedding that proceeds without a single misstep, beautifully staged, emotionally correct, widely admired, and yet no intimacy seems to pass between the people at the altar. Applause erupts. You join in. The question arrives later: was the meaning absent, or were you?
You might assume the fault is yours.
You reread passages. You underlined what others quoted. You waited for the delayed impact, the intellectual aftertaste that is supposed to bloom days later, while walking or brushing teeth or standing in line for coffee. It didn’t come. Instead, a thin unease settled in. The sense that you had witnessed a ritual without having been initiated into it. That you had learned the choreography without receiving the secret.
This is not an essay about “bad books”, and it is not an attempt to play literary executioner. I am not interested in sneering at craft, in tallying sentences, or in ranking novels the way school exercises reward cleverness and punish texture. Many of the books I’m circling here are competent, sometimes elegant, occasionally impressive by conventional measures. They are not failures. What unsettles me is something more difficult to name. They often succeed brilliantly at aims I do not share. They do what they set out to do, which is explain, reassure, align, clarify, signal seriousness, and they do it efficiently enough to be praised, circulated, taught, and recommended without friction. My problem is not that they are poorly made, some are actually brilliant, but that they leave my inner life unchanged, and that this lack of disturbance is increasingly mistaken for depth.
What I am trying to do here is closer to intellectual housekeeping than criticism: to separate admiration from impact, praise from consequence, reputation from experience. This is an unapologetically subjective exercise. I believe all taste is relative, but reading is lived before it is theorised. Books do not meet us in abstraction; they meet us in specific moments, through particular nerves, against the grain of our own history and attention. When a book is universally praised yet produces no internal movement, no friction, no aftershock, when it closes without rewiring anything, I want to take that response seriously rather than override it with borrowed enthusiasm.
So, my essay is not asking whether these books deserve their status in some abstract hierarchy. It is asking a more modest, and to me, more urgent question: what kind of readers do these books reward, and what kind of reading do they discourage? If a book trains us to recognise ourselves rather than to risk transformation, to agree rather than to wrestle, to feel correct rather than exposed, then its success deserves examination! Not condemnation, but scrutiny. What follows is not a verdict on literature, but a refusal to pretend that praise automatically equals intimacy, or that being impressed is the same thing as being changed.
What troubles me is not that these books are praised, but how they are praised, and why, and what that praise replaces.
Because somewhere along the way, we began confusing agreement with depth, recognition with change, and importance with intimacy.
The contemporary literary ecosystem is crowded with what I think of as signal books. Books that function less as encounters and more as emblems. You don’t so much read them as carry them, on lists, in conversations, on shelves that face outward rather than inward. They say something useful about the reader. They confer fluency. They reassure. They tell the room, without forcing you to speak, that you are informed, aligned, awake, erudite. And it’s not accidental.
In anxious times, and we are living in one long, vibrating anxiety, culture becomes less adventurous and more consolatory. We look for texts that reduce friction rather than increase it, that name the problem cleanly, that confirm our moral orientation, that don’t ask us to linger in contradiction too long. Books that can be summarised without residue.
The publishing world, which is neither villain nor guardian angel but a set of incentives with paper covers, knows this well. Books that travel easily are safer investments. Books that can be excerpted, taught, quoted, tweeted, adapted, moralised move. Books that refuse to behave, that resist extraction, that produce discomfort without clarity are harder to circulate. Harder to defend. Harder to sell without apology.
Therefore, the shelves fill up with books that are legible. Books that tell you what they are doing while they are doing it. Books that come with instructions. Books that trust you enough to agree, not enough to think sideways.
I don’t think this makes readers stupid. It makes them tired.
Lists have accelerated this fatigue. “Best of” lists, “essential” lists, “must-read-before-you-die” lists. Lists flatten time and temperament. They imply a universal nervous system, a single interior weather, a shared threshold for disturbance. They turn reading into a compliance exercise. Keep up! Catch up! Don’t fall behind!
But literature has never worked that way. The books that matter to us arrive idiosyncratically. Too early. Too late. By accident. By obsession. Often at moments when we are unguarded enough to be recalibrated.
A list cannot predict that.
Yet we pretend otherwise. We praise books because they are already praised. We inherit enthusiasm without re-entering it. Admiration becomes ceremonial. Rereading feels unnecessary; the verdict has been delivered.
And here is where something subtle breaks. Because a book can be influential without being alive. It can shape discourse without touching the private interior where reading actually happens. It can be cited endlessly and never visited again.
Influence is external. Depth is invasive.
I realised this distinction slowly, and not heroically obviously. Not in a blaze of contrarian courage, more like a mild but persistent nausea that crept in during conversations where everyone sounded eerily certain. “This book changed my life.” “Everyone should read this.” “It explains everything.”
Everything is a red flag.
Books that explain everything tend to evacuate mystery. They replace tension with clarity, do not trust the reader to sit with unresolved questions, so they resolve them for you, flatten moral complexity into moral position. They give you language where you might have discovered one on your own, at the cost of not discovering it.
This is deeply comforting. I understand the appeal. Certainty feels like relief when the ground won’t stop shifting. But literature has never been a relief mechanism. It has always been a destabilising one. It irritates the mind. It unsettles the self-image. It leaves a bruise you keep touching without quite knowing why.
When a book leaves my inner structure unchanged, I don’t care how celebrated it is — this sentence took me a long time to say without apologising.
There is another feature these hyped books tend to share, and it’s one we rarely name because it makes people uncomfortable: they are often erotically inert.
By erotic, I don’t mean sexual. I mean animated by desire. By contradiction. By longing that doesn’t know where it’s going. Many celebrated books today are scrupulously clean in this regard. They fear ambiguity. They fear appetite. They fear the mess of wanting something that might be wrong, or incoherent, or embarrassing to articulate.
They replace desire with correctness. With posture. With explanation.
A book afraid of desire is usually afraid of truth.
This fear shows up most clearly in the cult of “relatability”. We are endlessly told that good writing is writing in which the reader sees themselves. And while recognition can be a point of entry, it has slowly replaced the more dangerous function of literature: dislocation.
To recognise yourself is easy. To be moved out of yourself is harder. Recognition flatters. Dislocation transforms.
Too many books settle for the first and call it depth.
I’m aware, as I write this, that I’m skirting a social taboo. Disliking the wrong book is treated like a character flaw. A moral failing. A sign of insufficient empathy or intellectual immaturity. We have become oddly tender about collective taste. As if saying “this did nothing for me” were a personal insult to everyone who felt otherwise.
But I associate disappointment with discernment. And discernment, like all grown faculties, comes with risk.
Before I cross into examples, before I name names, I want to be clear about what my essay is not doing. It is not declaring the canon fraudulent. It is not proposing a counter-list. It is not replacing one orthodoxy with another...
