A decorated tank commander and recipient of Israel’s Medal of Valor  sits down with us to rethink how trauma is understood and treated. Dr. Yuval Neria  recounts twelve brutal days during the 1973 Yom Kippur War—where he was severely injured and awarded the Medal of Valor  (equivalent to the U.S. Medal of Honor)—that taught him to filter bad orders, protect his crews, and update reality on the fly, a mindset that later shaped his groundbreaking research on PTSD.
He explains a pivotal distinction: trauma is the event; the disorder is the emotional charge welded to memory. The job of recovery is to separate the two, restore meaning, and rebuild trust. We explore why three people can share a firefight and come away with different scars. Capacity varies—genetics, sleep, prior wounds, and the deeply interpersonal nature of harm all matter. Prisoners of war often face heavier burdens because cruelty was targeted and identity-stripping. Early support after homecoming is decisive; without it, sleep fails, depression blooms, and people chase relief through alcohol, marijuana, or compulsions. One-size-fits-all treatment misses the mark, especially when anxiety-heavy cases diverge from depression-dominant, morally injured profiles.
From leading a battalion in the 1982 Lebanon War to founding the Columbia-NYP Military Family Wellness Center and pioneering equine-assisted therapy through the Man O’ War Project , Dr. Neria discusses innovative approaches including psychedelics (MDMA, ketamine, psilocybin) and animal therapy. He addresses betrayal, moral injury, and sexual assault in the military, showing how reorienting one’s mindset, echoing John Boyd’s OODA “loop” sketch, can lead to resilience and healing.
This episode was sponsored by Ember Health .  Ember Health provides safe and effective IV ketamine care for individuals seeking relief from depression.
