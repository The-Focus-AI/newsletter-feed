What if the human brain isn’t a calculator but a story engine built for action under uncertainty? That single shift reframes strategy, leadership, and the OODA loop. Angus Fletcher —neuroscientist, author of Primal Intelligence, and advisor to special operations—joins us to explore how narrative becomes the decisive edge: not as marketing flair, but as the way we chain actions, break an adversary’s plot, and write a better future faster than our rivals.
We unpack why planning trains the planner, how Commander’s Intent gives the ending and protects agency, and where intuition really comes from. Hint: it’s not pattern-matching; it’s detecting exceptional information, the mismatch that signals new opportunity. From future-backward exercises and counterfactuals to Red Teaming and honest debriefs, we map concrete methods to keep Orientation supple, shift risk to the opponent, and avoid the brittleness of optimization. Fletcher shows how culture and literature (yes, Shakespeare) expand cognitive range, building the empathy and range leaders need to operate in complex, fast-changing environments.
We also examine the cognitive war—how associational feeds erode narrative capacity—and why truth is the most effective long-term PSYOP. In markets, boardrooms, and battlefields, the winners hold multiple viable plots, switch quickly as reality shifts, and align teams with ambitious, possible stories that work on the ground. If you’ve ever sensed that the “linear OODA” takes are missing the point, or that tech-first thinking is dulling the human edge, this conversation offers a clear, practical upgrade to how you plan, decide, and lead.
If this resonated, follow the show, share it with a teammate, and leave a quick review so more curious people can find it. What story will you run next?

John Boyd’s Conceptual Spiral  was originally titled “No Way Out.” In his words:
“There is no way out unless we can eliminate the features just cited. Since we don’t know how to do this, we must continue the whirl of reorientation…”
