Join The Whirl of ReOrientation!
Today is Friday, January 23, 2026. John Boyd would be ninety-nine years old today. As we celebrate, w remember that he didn’t give us slogans to repeat. He gave us ways to think, reframe, and thrive in the reality of VUCA  without lying to ourselves. Boyd’s work is a refusal to outsource thinking and judgment. It is a refusal to worship templates and formulas that confuse “activity” with adaptation. This is why we created The Whirl of Reorientation and  No Way Out . It’s also why both of these focus on the same battlefield: Orientation. Not as a buzzword, but as the decisive human advantage, where the environment doesn’t care about your credentials, your intentions, your capital position, or your slide deck.
So we’re recommitting to the work as we kick off Boyd’s centennial year. Not to “talk about Boyd,” but to teach and integrate his ideas in a way people can use immediately in real life, personally and professionally. We’re going to keep translating the hard parts without sanding off the edges. We’re going to keep showing the absurdity of the cartoon “OODA loop”  and the “It’s all about speed” religion  in order to teach Orientation, implicit guidance and control,  and OODA “loop” sketch as Boyd taught it.  He gave us a living abstraction for perception, learning, competing, and initiative. If you’re with us here at The Whirl, you’re not here to admire a legend as fans. You’re here as students and teachers to build the capability he fought for: Effective reorientation, cleaner decisions, and action that creates advantage.
To honor the first 99 Years of Boyd, we are linking what we believe to be the best starting points. These are the core articles that will carry us into Boyd’s 100th year.
