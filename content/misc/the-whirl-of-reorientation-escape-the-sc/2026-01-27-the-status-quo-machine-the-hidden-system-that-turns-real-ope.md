Stop Scrolling. Start Orienting.
You can tell the ground within an organization is starting to rot long before the figures show it. 
Everyone assembles for the third “all-hands” of the quarter, where nothing will be decided. The same slide decks on “breaking down silos” keep showing up for the fourth year in a row. The most attuned person on your team suddenly has “tone issues” and “an attitude problem.” People stop bringing things up in meetings and start talking in the parking lot.
If you’ve ever worked inside a corporation, you already know this scenario; you might not have had an actual name for it. You do now, so let’s break it down.
What follows is a hypothetical, bordering on “funny because it’s true, leaked memo from the Guardians Of Decay  and their favorite Merchants Of Certainty . The attempt is made in earnest to write in their authentic voice, for their intended purposes. All you have to do is read it, recognize the parts you’ve already lived through, and decide how much longer you’re willing to play a role in it, a role you did not create. So here we go.
Company Memo To All Hands:              Operating Instructions for Maintaining The Status Quo
This memo is intended for senior leaders, rising managers, and approved Merchants of Certainty  who understand and acknowledge the importance of protecting the company from volatility, disruption, and people who care too much about adapting to reality.
The goal of this memo is simple:
Preserve control, project confidence to analysts and shareholders, and ensure that any change happens slowly enough so that nothing essential to your position is ever at risk.
If we follow this to a T, these practices will guarantee us a stable, dignified slide into irrelevance that we will frame as “navigating a time of unprecedented change.”
Networks are only for speeches. Power lives in the corporate ladder.
In public, talk like you’ve just discovered networks, what they are, and how they work. Use catchy words and phrases like collaboration, teaming, and breaking down silos. Quote stuff you half-remember from approved podcasts and pop business books. In practice, do everything you can to preserve the hierarchy. Create an intricate latticework of managers  who report to other managers, who in turn report to their managers. If anybody suggests removing layers, tilt your head and say:
“Well, if we did that, it would create confusion about manager accountability, and that is something we do not want.”
Make sure all of the real work climbs the ladder through continuous status updates. This we shall refer to as “alignment,” and it will be an ongoing process to “measure.”
If informal networks start solving problems without permission, call that “side-channel behavior” and address it as fast as you can.
Protect the quarter. People grow back.
Officially, you’re here to create long-term value for “all stakeholders.”
But in reality, you’re here to protect this story every quarter so we look good to analysts on The Street. If numbers get tight, don’t start asking hard questions. Rather, reach for the usual tools, like a hiring freeze, travel ban, “performance management,” and anything else that provides cover. You never need to understand what people actually do. You only need to know who’s inconvenient. That includes, but is not limited to, people forwarding customer complaints, those asking “What are we trying to achieve?” in meetings, and especially those who refuse to pretend the last reorg solved anything.
Move them out, and call it “fit.”
When the same capacity issue arises again in the following months, open new requisitions but with different titles. You will explain the churn as “raising the talent bar to make sure we have the right people on the boat.”
Your Merchants of Certainty will provide before-and-after charts. They will have lots of colored bars, trend lines, and words like synergies, verticals, and focus.
No one will ask why the work feels harder with more PowerPoint, and if they do, launch them.
Values on the wall, fear in the air.
Every mature organization needs to have stated values.
Not lived values. Laminated values.
Print them big so everyone can see them, especially in the annual report. Integrity. Courage. Innovation. Trust. Those are the usual suspects, and you are free to use approved synonyms.
Display them in the lobby and outside conference rooms so people can stare at them while they wait for the myriads of meetings that will start late and solve absolutely nothing.
Once a year, rent a grand stage of a conference center with stage lighting, round tables, a speaker who quotes Navy SEALs and a TED Talks in the same sentence. At the conference, make sure that everyone has signed books and laminated cards with the values printed in a font that looks like we mean business. These are to be prominently displayedon desks throughout the buildings.
Then start doing the actual work. Treat values as a vocabulary quiz. The employees who say the right words in the right tone during reviews are to be identified as our “culture carriers” or “ambassadors.”
Treat visible integrity as a problem to be managed. The people who ask why decisions don’t match the slogans are “not constructive” and need to be moved out.
Run an “anonymous” engagement survey. Reassure everyone that their answers cannot be traced back to them, wink-wink.
Later, in the debrief, say things like, “It’s interesting this score is low in the Boston group,” and pause long enough for the message to land.
The more you can scare people about telling the truth, the more you must insist, “Our people and our culture are our greatest assets.”
Consultants exist to turn your hunches into inevitabilities.
A complicit Merchant Of Certainty is worth their daily rate. They know what we want: Validation that the cost cuts are “in line with peers,” Confirmation that the reorg aligns with “market structure,”and a narrative that culture is strong, engagement is high, and only a few “outliers” are unhappy.
You bring in Merchants Of Certainty to convert these hunches into things that will look like facts to the analysts and investors on The Street. They will arrive on the scene with an array of methodologies, templates, and spreadsheet-powered models. They will deploy a team of capable twenty-something-year-old recent Ivy League grads who have never met your customers. However, they know how to produce a 120-slide deck in a hotel room at midnight.
If any one of them should go off script and say something dangerous like, “You could push more authority down to the teams doing the work,” close the loop on the spot.
“That’s super interesting, but we’re not quite there yet. Let’s put a pin in that and capture it for a future conversation.”
Then route the contract to a safer firm next year. There is always another Merchant of Certainty happy to call your fears “prudence” and your decisions paralysis “governance.”
Declare your uniqueness and use it to stay ignorant.
Whenever someone brings in an idea from another domain, you have one job: explain why it doesn’t apply.
“That might work in the military, but we’re different here.”
“Sure, Japanese manufacturers are really successful with that type of thinking, but this isn’t a factory.”
“Tech companies can move fast like that, but we’re too highly regulated.”
“Startups can experiment and innovate, but we have too much at stake.”
Watch how quickly these moves empty the room of imagination and creativity.
You’re not saying the idea is bad. Rather, you’re saying your context is so special that it’s impossible to learn from anyone who has actually solved complex problems in VUCA , nonlinear environments.
As we move forward, this belief will become our shield against anything that would give teams more autonomy, create structures that would shorten feedback loops, and anything else that makes the current system look optional instead ofinevitable.
You end up with a strange equilibrium of a company that loudly proclaims it wants to be “world-class,” while ensuring to ignore most, if not all, of the actual world. We will position it as wisdom.
Wrap it all up in the language of “complexity.”
Finally, you need a protective screen. Choose and use words that sound too deep and smart to argue with, as if in an HBR article. Be sure to use the word “complexity” a lot. Remind everyone ad nauseam that we work in “volatility,” “asymmetric,” “ecosystem,” “AI,” and “transformation” if needed.
You don’t have to be precise; you need to keep things foggy.
Use phrases like:
“We’re operating in an increasingly complex environment.”
“Our response has to be multifaceted.”
“We’re working to build adaptive verticals.”
If someone asks questions like, “Who is responsible for this decision?” don’t answer right away. Walk them through all of the models, boxes, and arrows that the Merchants Of Certainty left behind. Stand near the whiteboard and gesture confidently. The goal is not to clarify, it’s to exhaust. Once people are worn down, they will stop bringing you problems that might force you to make choices between control and reality.
That is when the system is finally stable!
End of memo.
………….
You can run a company like this for a very long time. It might even last a lot longer than you might think. You’ll see the building continue to fill with people every morning, many who once believed they were there to do work that actually mattered.
Remember: Guardians of Decay do not need to win arguments. They need to make everyone else confused, isolated, and too tired to keep fighting for people, ideas, and things in that order.
Does any of this feel familiar to you? If so, then take a minute to reflect. Ask yourself:
Are you leading within an open, thriving, living system, carefully maintaining a very polished, very respectable, very stable form of decay?
Once you see it, you can’t unsee it!

Enter the Guerrilla Information War!
