If you’re a paid subscriber to The Whirl of Reorientation, you’ve got early access right now to our latest No Way Out episode featuring Colonel (Ret.) Frederick P. Stein,  co-author of the foundational book on Network Centric Warfare. This one hits close to home for me, and I want to share a personal connection that still fires me up.
Quick note: paid Whirl subscribers get early access to select No Way Out episodes plus the extra insights and commentary here. If these deep dives are resonating, please like, subscribe, and—most importantly—share both The Whirl of Reorientation and No Way Out with your friends.
Now, let’s get into something interesting: the connection between Network Centric Warfare and the F-14 Tomcat.
Back in the mid-2000s, after flying F-14s in the fleet and serving as an instructor, I first encountered NCW during the big “transformation” push under SECDEF Rumsfeld. It was sold to me as a technology revolution: better sensors, faster networks, data dominance. Coming from the Tomcat cockpit, that made sense. The F-14A with its game-changing AWG-9 radar, entered the fleet in 1972, eventually replacing the F-4, giving pilots and RIOs actual target video symbols and vastly superior onboard situational awareness compared to the F-4’s limited radar returns. Ground control intercept (GCI) had dominated with the F-4 because its radar couldn’t see enough of the battlespace on its own. The F-14 changed that. Information was now readily available right in the cockpit.
But the Navy didn’t evolve doctrine fast enough. For six years after the F-14 entered service, he Navy kept using the same rigid, controller-directed tactics from the F-4 Phantom days. That superior situational awareness sat underutilized until the 1978 Beacon South exercise exposed the flaw: F-14 crews tracked real threats like aggressive F-111s, but a ship-based controller vectored them away toward non-existent targets. That failure forced the change: first “Vector Logic” for the 7th Fleet, then “Command by Negation” fleet-wide in 1979. Crews could finally engage based on what they saw unless explicitly negated. It’s the classic lesson: new tech only wins when matched by doctrinal, organizational, and behavioral evolution. Empower those closest to the information.
That story hits close to home because my background is in F-14s. It taught me early that NCW isn’t about gadgets alone. It’s about decentralizing decisions to those closest to the information and evolving behavior and doctrine at the same time. The F-14 only became truly powerful when the organization caught up to the technology.
And that same principle shows up in one of the most fascinating stories from the episode: the Wal-Mart connection.
Military leaders like Admiral Cebrowski looked to commercial giants for network-centric lessons . Fred Stein shares how he personally interviewed Sam Walton at Wal-Mart headquarters in Arkansas. ...
