Imagine stepping off the freezing Manhattan street and finding a steady warmth at the bottom of your breath. That’s the thread running through our conversation with Jody Weiss —meditator, community builder, and co-host of Exploring Reality Maybe —as we explore how presence and modern therapies change lives. From VA-approved iREST Yoga Nidra to evidence-based ketamine infusions , we look at what actually helps veterans with PTSD, executives in crisis, and healers carrying the weight of others’ pain.
We dig into a practical definition of “home base” and why training attention throughout the day matters more than a single morning routine. Jody shares non-dual practices that quiet the intellect, interrupt rigid patterns, and open a wider field of perception. We connect stories of rapid transformation—like first responders stepping back from the brink—with neuroscientific advances in brain mapping that reveal how new circuits can unlock relief in days. The goal isn’t to numb or escape; it’s to become more present and more free.
This episode also celebrates the power of community and conscious capital. Jody describes Women Funding the World  and Consciousness Drinks,  spaces where clinicians, shamans, researchers, and investors meet to nurture the nurturers and fund work that sustains life. We talk about equine therapy, the stigma and renaissance of psychedelics, and the simple city practices—yes, even in Times Square—that “melt identity” and restore choice. Leaders will hear concrete micro-practices for building flow, delegating well, and showing up as a sensing, human presence instead of a walking agenda.
If you’ve been searching for tools that go beyond platitudes—real practices, real science, and real stories—this conversation offers a grounded path forward. Subscribe, share with a friend who needs hope, and leave a review with the practice you’re going to try first.
