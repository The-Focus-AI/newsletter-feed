**[5.6] Nato allies send troops to Greenland as Denmark calls for common defence — **[**theguardian.com**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/15/greenland-defence-nato-denmark-prime-minister-european-troops)** (**[**+487**](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/nato-allies-send-troops-to-greenland-as-denmark-calls-for-common-defence-ecd643d4)**)**

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen declared Greenland’s defense a NATO-wide concern as European troops deploy to the territory following US President Donald Trump’s repeated threats to take the island.

Forces from France, Germany, Norway, and Sweden are arriving in Greenland to bolster security. This follows a contentious Washington meeting where US officials reiterated ambitions to acquire the territory, citing security concerns regarding potential Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic.

Denmark will establish a permanent military presence alongside rotational NATO personnel. Prime Minister Frederiksen maintains Arctic defense is a collective responsibility, despite President Trump’s claims that Denmark cannot adequately protect the island.

**[6.7] Apple partners with Google to enhance Siri with advanced AI — **[**bbc.com**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdqvp2zqezo)** (**[**+64**](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/apple-partners-with-google-to-enhance-siri-with-advanced-ai-04db3c5f)**)**

Apple has partnered with Google to integrate Gemini AI models into Siri and other services, a move marking a significant shift toward outsourcing foundational technology to its primary competitor.

Analysts say the deal brings requested AI features to consumers but highlights Apple's struggle to develop internal alternatives. Apple Intelligence will utilize Google's models while continuing to operate within Apple's private cloud system to ensure user data privacy remains a priority.

**[6.7] Vagus nerve stimulator offers lasting relief for treatment-resistant depression — **[**medicine.washu.edu**](https://medicine.washu.edu/news/implant-provides-lasting-relief-for-treatment-resistant-depression/)** (**[**+8**](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/vagus-nerve-stimulator-offers-lasting-relief-for-treatment-resistant-depression-f433b704)**)**

A WashU Medicine study found that implanted vagus nerve stimulation devices provide enduring relief for severe treatment-resistant depression, with improvements sustained for at least two years in most responders.

The multicenter RECOVER trial followed nearly 500 participants who previously failed an average of thirteen treatments. Results showed that over 80% of patients who improved after one year maintained those benefits, with 20% of all participants reaching full remission by month 24.

The ongoing study aims to secure federal insurance coverage for the therapy, which is currently cost-prohibitive. The device functions by sending calibrated electrical pulses to the brain via the left vagus nerve.
