**[5.5] Venezuela's acting president signs law to privatize oil sector — **[**cbc.ca**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/venezuela-oil-sector-privatization-9.7067421)** (**[**+79**](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/venezuelas-acting-president-signs-law-to-privatize-oil-sector-a552e79f)**)**

Acting President Delcy Rodríguez signed legislation privatizing Venezuela's oil industry, reversing decades of state control to invite foreign investment following the U.S. military seizure of former president Nicolás Maduro.

The reform permits private control over production and independent arbitration, while the U.S. Treasury begins easing sanctions. These changes aim to attract international energy companies by offering protections against future expropriation and providing more favorable royalty rates for various new extraction projects.

This shift ends the state-dominated framework established twenty years ago by Hugo Chávez, which mandated majority stakes for PDVSA. It seeks to revitalize an industry devastated by mismanagement, corruption, and sanctions.

**[5.5] Denmark deports foreign nationals with prison sentences of one year or more — **[**hotnews.ro**](https://hotnews.ro/danemarca-va-expulza-strainii-condamnati-la-cel-putin-un-an-de-inchisoare-sa-ne-protejam-tara-in-loc-sa-protejam-infractorii-2161981)** (Romanian) (**[**+10**](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/denmark-deports-foreign-nationals-with-prison-sentences-of-one-year-or-more-35cbec79)**)**

Denmark announced Friday it will automatically expel foreign nationals sentenced to at least one year in prison for serious crimes, aiming to prioritize national protection over convicted criminals.

Effective May 1, the reform replaces case-by-case decisions previously governed by international human rights conventions. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated that refugees are temporary residents, stressing that legal frameworks must adapt to allow countries to prioritize their citizens' safety.

Statistics show only 70% of eligible offenders are currently deported. The plan also includes using electronic bracelets for some non-compliant foreigners, and incentivizing voluntary returns.
