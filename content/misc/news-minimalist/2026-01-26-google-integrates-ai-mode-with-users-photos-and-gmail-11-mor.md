**[5.9] Google offers users option to plug AI mode into their photos, email for more personalized answers — ****[apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/google-search-personal-artificial-intelligence-gemini-95f056c7c4bbd728d931578d3be49d31)**** (****[+26](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/google-integrates-ai-into-search-for-personalized-answers-using-photos-and-email-90b4b121)****)**

Google is launching a "Personal Intelligence" feature that integrates its search engine AI with Gmail and Photos to deliver answers tailored to users’ private interests, habits, and digital histories.

Available Thursday for U.S. subscribers and Labs users, the Gemini 3i-powered tool analyzes travel itineraries and photo libraries. It aims to provide specific recommendations for trips or restaurants by connecting information stored across various Google applications.

**[6.5] New U.S. defense strategy prioritizes Western Hemisphere and China over Russia and Europe — **[**apnews.com**](https://apnews.com/article/national-defense-strategies-2022-2026-eeac59bd5748de279c20b6050b02d28a)** (**[**+31**](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/new-us-defense-strategy-prioritizes-western-hemisphere-and-china-over-russia-and-europe-dc4e6991)**)**

The Trump administration’s 2026 National Defense Strategy prioritizes U.S. homeland security and China deterrence, mandating that European and Asian allies assume primary responsibility for their own regional conventional defense.

The document categorizes Russia as a manageable threat, urging NATO members to increase defense spending to five percent of GDP. It also incorporates military options against narco-terrorists and tasks South Korea with leading deterrence efforts against North Korean military provocations.

Replacing the 2022 strategy, this policy emphasizes the Abraham Accords for Middle East stability and seeks a peace with China that ensures American economic access without requiring existential conflict or regime change.

**[5.6] England's NHS launches gene database to help families check cancer risk — **[**bbc.com**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62v7l4v7gro)** (**[**+5**](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/englands-nhs-launches-gene-database-to-help-families-check-cancer-risk-8b51aa42)**)**

NHS England has launched a world-first genetic database identifying individuals at high risk for cancer, allowing thousands to access early screening and personalized treatment to improve survival rates.

The register monitors 120 genes linked to increased cancer likelihood. By centralizing existing genetic data, the NHS can proactively offer routine screenings and preventative care to those with hereditary risks, including potential treatments tailored to an individual’s specific genetic makeup.

This initiative, part of a ten-year prevention plan, follows a successful database for Lynch syndrome. Health officials emphasize that the secure system will accelerate medical innovation and help catch more cancers earlier.
