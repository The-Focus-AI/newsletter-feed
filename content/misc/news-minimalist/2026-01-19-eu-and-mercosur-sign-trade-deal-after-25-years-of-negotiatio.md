**[5.8] European Union and Mercosur sign landmark free trade agreement — ****[apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/mercosur-european-union-trade-agreement-south-america-b779460da4b7ecb6aa15d322976fa70d)**** (****[+59](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/european-union-and-mercosur-sign-landmark-free-trade-agreement-ffb2f923)****)**

The European Union and Mercosur signed a landmark free trade agreement Saturday, establishing one of the world’s largest trade zones to counter global protectionism and rising international trade tensions.

The deal eliminates over 90% of tariffs between 700 million consumers, strengthening European ties in resource-rich South America. It provides new market access for industrial sectors while addressing agricultural concerns through progressive tariff reductions and strict import quotas on sensitive products like beef.

Following 25 years of negotiations, the agreement requires ratification by the European Parliament. Potential hurdles remain, including ongoing opposition from European farmers and the French government over concerns regarding agricultural competition.

**[6.2] China's population declines for fourth year as birth rate hits record low — **[**bbc.com**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79r7v7qr53o)** (**[**+24**](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/chinas-population-declines-for-fourth-year-as-birth-rate-hits-record-low-eee979b8)**)**

China’s population fell by 3.39 million in 2025, marking a fourth consecutive year of decline as record-low birth rates threaten the long-term stability of the world's second-largest economy.

Government data revealed a record-low birth rate of 5.63 per 1,000 people. Despite financial incentives and expanded family limits, high child-rearing costs and lifestyle preferences continue to deter couples, while the national death rate reached its highest level since 1968.

This shift reflects broader regional trends and pressures China’s shrinking workforce and depleted pension funds. United Nations experts estimate the nation’s population could decrease by more than half by the year 2100.

**[6.3] World's first legally binding treaty to protect oceans and marine life takes effect — ****[abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-01-18/high-seas-treaty-marine-protection-in-effect/106241974)**** (****[+3](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/worlds-first-legally-binding-treaty-to-protect-oceans-and-marine-life-takes-effect-328f3fac)****)**

The world’s first legally binding High Seas Treaty entered into force, establishing a historic framework to protect marine life across two-thirds of the planet’s oceans beyond national jurisdictions.

After twenty years of negotiations, the treaty reached its 60-nation ratification threshold in September. Currently, 83 countries have ratified the agreement, which now mandates environmental impact assessments and cooperation on ocean science to protect areas previously considered unregulated waters.

Although 145 nations signed the accord, major powers like the United States and Australia have yet to ratify it.
