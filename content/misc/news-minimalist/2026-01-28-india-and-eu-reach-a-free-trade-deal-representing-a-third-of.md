India and the European Union reached a historic free trade agreement after twenty years of negotiations, significantly reducing tariffs to enhance economic stability for two billion people across both regions.

The accord will eliminate or reduce tariffs on nearly all traded goods, specifically targeting sectors like textiles, automobiles, and pharmaceuticals. It also establishes frameworks for deeper defense cooperation and improved mobility for skilled workers and students to strengthen strategic and commercial ties.

Driven by shifting trade dynamics with the United States, the deal aims to increase annual bilateral trade to 200 billion dollars by 2030. Formal ratification and implementation are expected next year.

**[5.7] Atomic scientists move Doomsday Clock to 85 seconds to midnight due to global threats — **[**nbcnews.com**](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/doomsday-clock-midnight-atomic-scientists-russia-china-ukraine-israel-rcna256276)** (**[**+76**](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/atomic-scientists-move-doomsday-clock-to-85-seconds-to-midnight-due-to-global-threats-07a01e04)**)**

Atomic scientists moved the Doomsday Clock to 85 seconds before midnight, the closest setting in history, warning that nuclear aggression and global conflicts have brought humanity nearer to annihilation.

Key drivers include the ongoing Ukraine war, Middle East conflicts, and the looming expiration of the New START treaty. Scientists also emphasized risks from unregulated military artificial intelligence, global disinformation, and the resumption of nuclear weapons testing processes by major global powers.

Established in 1947 by scientists like Albert Einstein, the Doomsday Clock serves as a symbolic warning of human-caused global disaster. Recent years have seen the clock move consistently closer to midnight.

Astronomers using a new AI tool discovered nearly 1400 rare cosmic anomalies within the Hubble archive, including 800 previously unknown objects, significantly accelerating the identification of unique astrophysical phenomena.

The neural network, AnomalyMatch, processed 100 million images in just two and a half days. Researchers confirmed findings including merging galaxies, gravitational lenses, and jellyfish galaxies, demonstrating the algorithm's ability to efficiently scan decades of astronomical data for rare scientific targets.
