**[5.6] Wind and solar power lead EU energy mix for the first time in 2025 — ****[lavenir.net](https://www.lavenir.net/actu/monde/2026/01/22/eolien-et-solaire-pour-la-1ere-fois-devant-les-fossiles-dans-le-mix-energetique-de-lue-en-2025-une-etape-majeure-dans-la-transition-energetique-MK5BK77R7ZEONNKQWH2U7T5KRE/)**** (French) (****[+15](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/wind-and-solar-power-lead-eu-energy-mix-for-the-first-time-in-2025-757ce95d)****)**

For the first time, wind and solar power surpassed fossil fuels in the European Union’s electricity production mix in 2025, marking a major milestone in the region's energy transition.

According to think tank Ember, these renewables generated 841 terawatt-hours, accounting for 30.1% of EU electricity. This exceeded fossil fuels, which fell to 29% as solar production hit record highs and coal reached a historic low of 9.2%.

**[5.7] Hundreds of artists, including Scarlett Johansson and Cate Blanchett, launch anti-AI campaign against unauthorized use of copyrighted work — **[**variety.com**](https://variety.com/2026/film/global/scarlett-johansson-cate-blanchett-anti-ai-campaign-1236637571/)** (**[**+3**](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/hundreds-of-artists-including-scarlett-johansson-and-cate-blanchett-launch-anti-ai-campaign-against-unauthorized-use-of-copyrighted-work-5e484815)**)**

Scarlett Johansson, Cate Blanchett, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt joined 700 creators in launching a campaign condemning tech companies for training artificial intelligence on copyrighted work without authorization, labeling it theft.

The group asserts that unauthorized scraping endangers millions of jobs and economic growth. They urge developers to adopt transparent licensing agreements, proving that technological advancement can coexist with the protection of creators' intellectual property rights and legal authorship.

This initiative follows several high-profile legal disputes, notably involving Johansson, who has previously taken action against the unauthorized use of her name, voice, and likeness in AI-generated advertisements and content.
