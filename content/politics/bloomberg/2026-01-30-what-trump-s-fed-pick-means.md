Trump’s pick for next head of the Fed: Here’s what to know

Trump’s pick for next head of the Fed: Here’s what to know

Donald Trump chose Kevin Warsh 
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-30/trump-picks-a-reinvented-kevin-warsh-to-lead-the-federal-reserve>
 to be the next chair of the US Federal Reserve. Warsh has declared his 
alignment with the president’s views on monetary policy, but that doesn’t mean 
the central bank is about to fall in line with his economic agenda.

If confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, Warsh would succeed Fed 
Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends in May. It marks a comeback for Warsh, a 
former Fed governor whom Trump passed over for the top job in 2017 when he 
selected Powell.

 Wall Street investors and strategists 
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-30/trump-picks-kevin-warsh-as-fed-chair-wall-street-reacts>
 are already saying that Warsh is a relatively hawkish choice.Here’s how 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/latest/markets-wrap> the announcement is moving 
markets.
