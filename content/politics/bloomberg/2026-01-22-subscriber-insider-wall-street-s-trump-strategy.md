biggest investment houses gathered at a private breakfast to compare notes 
before President Donald Trump’s arrival. They appeared tochoose their words 
carefully 
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2026-01-21/wall-street-cautious-as-trump-shakes-global-markets-in-davos>
.

Temasek, the group discussed how rapidly changing US policies mayhit global 
markets <https://www.bloomberg.com/latest/markets-wrap>. At one point, a top 
executive made foreboding remarks about the potential ripple effects from the 
administration’sdemand for Greenland 
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/trump-s-nato-deal-would-mean-us-mines-and-missiles-in-greenland>
. But even then, the person didn’t mention Trump by name. 

So goes Wall Street’s delicate dance at the start of 2026: How do you help 
clients prepare for Trump’s policies without drawing his ire? Increasingly, the 
answer seems to be self-censorship.
