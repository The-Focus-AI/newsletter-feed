The backlash against the threat of criminal charges at the Federal Reserve 
continues to grow. Global central bankers <https://bloom.bg/49QZZbI> threw 
their support behind Jerome Powell, saying they “stand in full solidarity” with 
the Fed. Meanwhile, we learn Jeanine Pirrodidn’t seek sign-off 
<https://bloom.bg/4qSLOsx> from her bosses at the DOJ before subpoenaing the 
Fed and has no plans to back down from an investigation.

Donald Trump said he is imposing a 25% tariff on goods from countries “doing 
business” with Iran,ratcheting up pressure <https://bloom.bg/4qOWZSX> on the 
nation’s government. But the announcementrisks derailing 
<https://bloom.bg/3LFhxOS> his one-year trade truce with China, the world’s top 
buyer of Iranian oil. On the ground in Iran, protests persist in localized 
pockets as an activist group warned of imminent executions.

 Deep Dive: Spotify Under New Leadership 

 <https://bloom.bg/3LJdzVp> Illustration: Chan Yu Chen/Bloomberg Businessweek 
Spotify has grown from a minuscule, money-eating startup into the most 
powerful company in the music industry, with 281 million paid subscribers. Now 
the fate of the company <https://bloom.bg/3LJdzVp> lies with its new co-CEOs 
<https://bloom.bg/4pFrTw6>, Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström, racing to 
ensure the next generation of listeners don’t do to Spotify what Spotify did to 
CDs.

 * The two Swedes face numerous challenges. They’re  already taking steps  
<https://bloom.bg/3YCj1fK>to address longstanding complaints that the platform 
wields too much power and underpays its artists <https://bloom.bg/3NgHXHg>. 
 * They’ll need to steer Spotify’s push into audiobooks and video, which 
includes therecent deal with Netflix <https://bloom.bg/3YCj23i> that will bring 
some Spotify video podcasts to the streaming service. 
 * Spotify will need to fend off competition for users’ time from Meta, 
Netflix, TikTok and YouTube, all the while dealing with the challenge of AI. 
Last year,it took steps <https://bloom.bg/3YGmk5A> to protect users from 
AI-generated “slop” that floods the platform. 
 * In December, Spotify announced it would begin testing a feature that will 
let users type an idea for a playlist <https://bloom.bg/49SPwMX> into the app 
and receive a unique selection of songs. 

 The Big Take 

 <https://bloom.bg/4py1Si7> Illustration: 731/Bloomberg/Getty Images 
On the verge of naming a new Federal Reserve chief, the Trump administration 
took one more shot at the incumbent—and triggered a Washington backlash 
<https://bloom.bg/4py1Si7> that could yet derail the wider campaign to tighten 
White House control over the central bank.

For all the bluster and juvenile memes surrounding American ambitions in 
Greenland, the White House has yet to offer a good explanation forwhy the US 
needs to control the massive Arctic territory, Bloomberg’s Editors write. 
Officials who know bettershould press to end this ill-considered campaign.

Elon Musk’s plan to install a vast array of data centers in space sounds like 
something out of science fiction. But despite the massive engineering 
challenges,the idea has some attractions <https://bloom.bg/3NJ799i>—not least 
the ability to give orbiting spacecraft near-constant access to the sun.
