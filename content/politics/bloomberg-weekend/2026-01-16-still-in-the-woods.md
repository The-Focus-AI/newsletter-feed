The American housing market got a little worse this month despite some good 
news on the mortgage rate front, as confidence among homebuilders unexpectedly 
fell because of costly sales incentives.

An index of market conditions from the National Association of Home Builders 
and Wells Fargo decreased 2 points to 37 in January,its first decline since 
August <https://bloom.bg/4pGYZf6>. That fell short of the median estimate of 
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. A value below 50 means more builders see 
conditions as poor than good.
 <https://bloom.bg/4pGYZf6> 
That downbeat mood puts a damper on momentum built in recent weeks as mortgage 
rates <https://bloom.bg/4sEyxW5> slid to one of the lowest levels in years and 
home price growth slowed. Sales ofpreviously owned <https://bloom.bg/3Npvoth> 
homes in December reached their strongest pace in two years, andnew-home sales 
<https://bloom.bg/49sl509> also rose to 2023 levels over the past few months.

But despite some improvement in affordability, prices are still high overall 
and mortgage rates remain double their 2021 levels. That’s forced contractors 
to cut prices and offer those pricey sweeteners, often by buying down 
customers’ mortgage rates.—David E. Rovella <https://bloom.bg/42IzHFH>

Bloomberg Opinion  <https://bloom.bg/4jLTHOa> 
Why Putin’s Silence Is So Worrying  <https://bloom.bg/4jLTHOa> 
While Donald Trump goes about reversing America’s role in the world, launching 
a surprise attack on Venezuela while threatening to bomb or invade friend and 
foe alike, the Kremlin has said little and done nothing.
 <https://bloom.bg/4jLTHOa> 
 Read the Story  <https://bloom.bg/4jLTHOa> 

In Venezuela, everything looks pretty much the same these days despite the 
American attack and rendition of President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month. 
Acting President Delcy Rodríguez has seamlessly moved into the top role, 
chairing meetings with senior officials, greeting international envoys and 
meeting with diplomats.

But beneath the continuity, Rodríguez is quickly moving to consolidate 
authority and unite the fractured ruling coalition. There are some subtle 
changes,but other moves are far more consequential <https://bloom.bg/3LPATko>.

Adriana Camberos, a San Diego businesswoman who had her prison sentence 
commuted by Trump in 2021, went on to be convicted a second time on new fraud 
charges. On Thursday, she received a pardon from the president.As did her 
brother <https://bloom.bg/4b3xHMh>. 

The siblings were convicted <https://bloom.bg/4jT5PNq> in 2024 of making tens 
of millions of dollars by selling wholesale groceries after lying to 
manufacturers about where the products would be sold. Other people granted 
clemency by Trump have gone on to commit new crimes, too.

A number of people charged or convicted in attacking the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 
2021, all granted clemency by Trump, have gone on to commit fresh offenses. 
Then there’s Eliyahu “Eli” Weinstein, a convicted Ponzi schemer whose 24-year 
prison termwas commuted <https://bloom.bg/3YNcWx4> by Trump in 2021. In 
November, he was sentenced to 37 years behind bars for stealing $44 million 
from investorsafter he was released <https://bloom.bg/3YNcYoG>. He is said to 
be considering a new bid for clemency as well.

The New York Times reported Friday that this new raft of clemency grants, as 
in previous cases,were tied to people close to Trump <https://bloom.bg/49BvRjm> 
rather than the strict and deliberate guidelines generally followed by previous 
administrations.

 <https://bloom.bg/3LDRbwA>

 The High Price of Clemency  <https://bloom.bg/3LDRbwA> 
Eli Weinstein stole millions of dollars from investors during Covid after 
Donald Trump commuted his sentence for an earlier conviction. Now Weinstein is 
said to be planning to ask Trump for clemency again.
 <https://bloom.bg/3LDRbwA>

The European Parliament is considering linking approval of a massive US trade 
deal <https://bloom.bg/49HJyxa> to Trump backing down from his threats to 
invade Greenland <https://bloom.bg/3YJHeAM>, putting further strain on an 
agreement already facing opposition.

“It is clear that national sovereignty of any country needs to be respected by 
all partners of the trade deal,” said Bernd Lange, the long-time chair of 
parliament’s trade committee who is helping oversee the discussion, in an 
interview with Bloomberg.

EU lawmakers are on the cusp of finalizing the trade pact, which the US struck 
with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last summer. While the 
agreement has already been partially implemented, it still needs the 
parliament’s approval to become official.

Trump on Friday retreated from his latest threat to invoke the Insurrection Act
 <https://bloom.bg/4pLY0ud>, this time in Minnesota. But federal immigration 
agents have reportedly intensified their attacks on demonstrators across the 
country, including allegedly blinding two of them in California. The tactics in 
Trump’s immigration dragnet have come in the aftermath of the Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement agency’s killing of an unarmed US citizen, Renee Good, and 
shooting of an unarmed man this month in Minnesota. TheWashington Post also 
reported the potential homicide of a man in ICE custody 
<https://bloom.bg/3YM6syv> in Texas.

ICE and related agencies have been stopping and detaining more American 
citizens, according to news reports, including allegedly dragging a woman from 
her car <https://bloom.bg/49CaYED> as she headed to a medical appointment, 
going door-to-door in suburban communities demanding proof of citizenship, 
battering down a door <https://bloom.bg/4jKlzSN> of a house without a judicial 
warrant while, according to an ACLU lawsuit, allegedlytargeting individuals 
based on the color of their skin <https://bloom.bg/3LjZIoB>

The Los Angeles Times reported two demonstrators in California alleged federal 
agents shot them both at point-blank range with so-called less lethal rounds, 
blinding them <https://bloom.bg/4pOVe7r>. Trump administration spokespersons 
have regularly responded to claims of civil rights violations by saying the use 
of force is justified, only to often becontradicted by subsequent video evidence
 <https://bloom.bg/49Ig5U4>.

Trump has declared the US affordability crisis to be “fake” and a “hoax.” But 
you wouldn’t know it from the way the administration has been scrambling to 
show Americans it feels their pain. A new poll showing sharplydecreasing 
support for Trump by his base <https://bloom.bg/4pKTZWT> when it comes to 
economic issues may be adding fuel to the fire.

Over the past few weeks he has tweeted out a raft of promises and orders tied 
to housing, credit cards, healthcare, electricity, 401(k)s—all garnering 
dutiful news stories that often fail to note most of the proposals are beyond 
his powers, requiring Congressional legislation.

Now the administration says it will delay using a power it does have 
<https://bloom.bg/4pGZTYQ>, specifically targeting delinquent student 
borrowers. The Education Department said it has paused “for a bit 
<https://bloom.bg/3Zfq4uW>” its efforts to garnish the wages of what could be 
millions of Americans behind on their college loans.
