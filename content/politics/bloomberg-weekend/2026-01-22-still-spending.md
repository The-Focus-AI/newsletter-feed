New jobs data from the Trump administration showed unemployment benefit claims 
remaining steady, coming in at 200,000. Those numbers weresignificantly below 
the median forecast <https://bloom.bg/4qxrgpB> in a Bloomberg survey of 
economists, which called for 209,000.

According to two other government reports, the US economy expanded in the 
third quarterby slightly more than initially reported <https://bloom.bg/4kdZvQR>
 and personal spendingrose at a solid pace in November 
<https://bloom.bg/45VVt9y>. The latest data should reassure the Federal Reserve 
that the economy remains on a solid footing despite a cooler labor market, said 
James McCann at Edward Jones.

“There looks to be little urgency to cut rates at next week’s meeting, and the 
central bank could stay on hold for longer should growth remain robust into 
2026 and inflation continue to run at above target rates,” he said. Here’syour

 What You Need to Know Today 

In a dramatic public hearing—initially opposed by Republicans reluctant to 
give him a public forum—former Special Counsel Jack Smith testified before 
Congress Thursday that Donald Trump, who has been indicted four times and 
convicted once, engaged in criminal conduct with regard to his alleged attempt 
to overthrow the 2020 election and cling to power.

“Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President 
Trump engaged in criminal activity <https://bloom.bg/45quqDj>,” said Smith, a 
former war crimes prosecutor. “If asked whether to prosecute a former president 
based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that 
president was a Republican or a Democrat.”

Smith’s two federal prosecutions of Trump, which faced long delays in part due 
to rulings by the US Supreme Court and a Trump-appointed judge in Florida, were 
eventually dropped before Trump returned to the White House. Smith, in 
defending the strength of his cases against him, pointed to the witnesses he 
had planned to call.

“Some of the most powerful witnesses were witnesses who, in fact, were fellow 
Republicans who had voted for Donald Trump <https://bloom.bg/3NL9dOd>, who had 
campaigned for him and who wanted him to win the election,” Smith said.

Bank of America and Citigroup are mulling new cards with a 10% rate to satisfy 
Trump’s call to cap credit card interest rates for one year. It’s arguably an
easier path to mollifying the White House <https://bloom.bg/3YU25BE> since 
offering new products is less complicated than reworking existing cards.

Trump’s effort to show he’s engaged with what’s been called a growing 
affordability crisis has included a flurry of demands and orders, many of which 
are outside his powers. Earlier this week, Trump seemed to acknowledge thiswhen 
he said he would ask Congress <https://bloom.bg/45on3fv> to implement the 
credit card proposal.

Bank executives have decried the call for a cap, saying it will force lenders 
to pull credit lines for consumers. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie 
Dimon said a cap wouldspell <https://bloom.bg/45VTaDq> “economic disaster” for 
the US.

European Union lawmakers are expected to vote on ratifying the bloc’s trade 
deal with the US,restarting the process <https://bloom.bg/4jTKrHR> after Trump 
walked back a threat to impose tariffs on European allies that opposed his 
plans to annex Greenland.

European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said Thursday that Trump’s 
sudden reversal was enough to justify voting on the measure, potentially in the 
coming days. Parliament’s approval is the final EU step needed for the trade 
accord to enter into force.

Trump’s public U-turn on attacking Greenland and related tariffs came after a 
meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the World Economic Forum in 
Davos, Switzerland, yesterday. Their accord for Greenland entailed the 
stationing of USmissiles and mining rights <https://bloom.bg/4jUczKE> aimed at 
keeping out Chinese interests. However, the bulk of the national security 
justifications Trump raised in defending his desire to possess Greenland are in 
fact redundant of treaty rights the UShas had for 75 years

Intel gave a lackluster forecast for the current quarter because supply 
shortages aremaking it harder for the chipmaker to meet customer demand 
<https://bloom.bg/3YVXCON>, a disappointment for investors who anticipated more 
of a boost from new products.

Intel—the tech company in which US taxpayers now have a multibillion-dollar 
stake—is struggling with its manufacturing yields (the percentage of usable 
chips coming out of its factories). The once-dominant chip company has spent 
years trying to restore its edge and recover from market share losses. Intel 
shares fell about 3% in extended trading Thursday following the report.

Intel had been riding a wave of Wall Street enthusiasm. Investors poured money 
into the stock in recent months, betting that new products would further 
bolster finances. Intel also attracted high-profile investments from Nvidia, 
SoftBank and in anunorthodox move <https://bloom.bg/4a7ULZg> the Trump 
administration.

China’s rapid electrification has been hailed as a miracle. But by some 
measures,India is even further ahead <https://bloom.bg/3LOS4Tg>. The nation is 
electrifying faster and using fewer fossil fuels per capita than China did when 
it was at similar levels of economic development, according to a new report. 
It’s a sign that clean electricity could be the most direct way toboost growth 
<https://bloom.bg/4jXt3BW> for other developing economies, too.

Neither India nor China is going electric purely to cut emissions or meet 
climate targets. They’re doing so because it makes economic sense, particularly 
for India, which imports more than 40% of its primary energy in the form of 
coal, oil and gas. These developments fly against “the orthodox narrative that 
emerging markets must follow the same path the West and China took: go from 
biomass to fossil fuels,” said Kingsmill Bond, a strategist at Ember and one of 
the authors of the report.
