China is making a move toward center stage amid the growing chaos of US 
foreign and economic policy under Donald Trump. As the 79-year-old president 
threatens new tariffs or military attack on friend and foe alike, President Xi 
Jinping is welcoming a procession of leaders looking to mend fences with the 
world’s other major economy.

South Korea’s Lee Jae Myung kicked off the trend this month, cementing an 
improvement in ties by becoming his nation’sfirst president to visit China 
since 2019 <https://bloom.bg/45awCi1>. Canada’s Mark Carney will arrive late 
Wednesday. Days later, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to travel to the 
Chinese capital to buoy British business, marking a first since 2018. Germany’s 
chancellor, Friedrich Merz is also expected to visit next month.

But beyond making nice with China <https://bloom.bg/45awD5z>, there’s another 
way to look at these trips: the ever-present “fear of missing out.” The parade 
of politicians steps off months after Xi sealed the latest version of a tariff 
truce with Trump over his trade war, and things seem to be loosening up—for now.

“Trump is triggering diplomatic FOMO across the Western world,” said Neil 
Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s 
Center for China Analysis. “His approach leaves leaders eager to engage Xiso 
they aren’t sidelined by US-China maneuvering <https://bloom.bg/4jDyZzO>.” —

US mortgage rates slid last week to one of the lowest levels in years, 
sparking a flurry of purchase and refinancing activity that offers hope for a 
plodding housing market. The contract rate on a 30-year mortgage dropped 7 
basis points to 6.18% in the week ended Jan. 9, according to Mortgage Bankers 
Association data released Wednesday. That’s thelowest reading since September 
2024 <https://bloom.bg/4quVSby> and one of the lowest since 2022. 

The figures from the industry group lend credence to Trump administration data 
out Tuesday showing the annualized pace of new-home sales in October was near 
the strongest since 2023. The numbers arguably illustrate some relief for a 
housing market that’s been battered by poor affordability in recent years.

After reporting fourth-quarter results that beat analyst estimates 
<https://bloom.bg/4qo1q7F>, Citigroup’s shares on Wednesday began to fall once 
Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser and Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason 
responded to investor questions. They noted that the bank has trimmed guidance 
on its efficiency ratio and expressed caution after one analyst pushed them to 
suggest Citigroup would shed its regulatory penalties this year.

Fraser, who took the helm almost five years ago, has enlisted executives from 
JPMorgan and Bank of America to help her turn around key divisions, shake off 
Citigroup’s status as a laggard and make it more competitive. A big part of 
that has been Fraser’s firing of thousands of her employees,including more this 
week <https://bloom.bg/49o9zTu>.

The firm reached a long-awaited milestone last year when its market value 
surpassed the book value <https://bloom.bg/3NliZqk> of its assets for the first 
time since 2018. In a vote of confidence, the boardgranted 
<https://bloom.bg/4jDVnZP> Fraser the title of chair, too. The bank, however, 
has spent heavily as it seeks to resolve a pair of orders from regulators 
demanding improvements to internal systems, and is now trying to dial down 
costs. And to do that, Fraser saysshe plans to fire even more people 
<https://bloom.bg/4qqFF79>.
 <https://bloom.bg/4qo1q7F> 

The news was worse for Wells Fargo. The bank missed analysts’ profit estimates 
as termination costs drove up expenses, sending its shares plummeting by the 
most in six months. Like Citigroup, the bank has been engaged in mass firings, 
spending $612 million on severance.

The company has been shrinking headcount for years in a bid to increase 
efficiency, and reduced its employee count to 205,000 at the end of 2025, down 
from almost 211,000 at the end of September. Also like Citigroup, the bank says
it’s likely to fire more of its employees in the new year

Germany will take the lead among European nations sending military personnel 
to Greenland after Denmark said its meeting with aides to Trump, who appears 
intent on taking its territory, revealed a “fundamental disagreement 
<https://bloom.bg/3LAJDea>” remains.

European delegations being sent to Greenland—at Denmark’s request—are a bid to 
defuse the latest threat of American military aggression. More broadly, the 
Danes have pointed out a big hole in Trump’s national security justification 
for invasion. A comprehensive defense agreement dating back to 1951 already 
allows the US to use the territory—where it has had military installations for 
decades—as it needs to for defenses.
