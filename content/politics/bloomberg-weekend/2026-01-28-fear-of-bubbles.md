Microsoft reported Wednesday that its spending surged to a record high as 
cloud sales growth slowed, a one-two punch that sent the company’s shares down 
5% amid broader investor concerns that—and stop us if this sounds familiar 
<https://bloom.bg/4kg3Y5l>—it might take too long for tech giants to see 
massive AI investments pay off.

Microsoft has been rushing to bake artificial intelligence tools, including 
those powered by OpenAI, into its products, betting that chatbots and 
automation technology will boost sales of the company’s productivity software 
and cloud services. Capital expenditures for the fiscal second quarter hit 
$37.5 billion, up 66% from a year earlier and exceeding analyst estimates for 
$36.2 billion.

Still, others among the bubble set didn’t get slapped around as badly 
<https://bloom.bg/45wthdq>. Meta got a more positive investor reception 
<https://bloom.bg/4kpAylz> after conceding that it has been spending more than 
anticipated to build out its AI business. —Natasha Solo-Lyons 
<https://bloom.bg/3DLM8WQ> and David E. Rovella <https://bloom.bg/42IzHFH>

 What You Need to Know Today 

Wall Street’s wisest have something other than AI to worry about. Kalshi, the 
booming platform that churns out predictions on everything from the Super Bowl 
to US elections, isshowing early promise as an accurate forecaster 
<https://bloom.bg/4qM40UW> of Federal Reserve policy and economic data. When it 
comes to predicting interest-rate decisions, Kalshi is “roughly consistent” 
with the pros, such as those surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
In a notable case, the prediction market even outperformed humans when the 
central bank delivered a surprise, jumbo-sized cut.

Artificial Intelligence  <https://bloom.bg/3Z1ESNX> 
The Bubble Is Getting Closer to Popping  <https://bloom.bg/3Z1ESNX> 
CEOs at a few tech giants are now celebrities, with markets hanging on every 
word. But what may burst the AI bubble, Shannon O’Neil writes, isn’t circular 
financing; it’s Trump’s trade and immigration policies.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who faces an unprecedented criminal probe by the 
Trump administration, says there is “clear improvement” in what’s expected for 
the economy in the year ahead.

Stephen Miller, the 40-year-old former Capitol Hill aide at the center of the 
Trump administration’s immigration dragnet,sought to backpedal 
<https://bloom.bg/3MdKotV> from his initial attacks on the victim in one of two 
killings by federal agents this month. The rare admission may be part of an 
internal blame-game between Trump’s adjutants as a few members of their own 
party appeared to balk after Alex Pretti was shot dead.

A new internal government report buttressed multiple video analyses showing 
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem falsely accused Pretti of brandishing a 
gun when she vilified the 37-year-old after he was killed by members of her 
department.Talk of impeachment <https://bloom.bg/4tlRVaW> is growing around the 
54-year-old former South Dakota governor, whoAxios reported has said she was 
following orders from Miller <https://bloom.bg/3NKh66C>. Meanwhile, widening 
protests over the killings of Pretti and Renee Good, and against Trump’s 
immigration policies in general, are scheduledto go nationwide on Friday 
<https://bloom.bg/4rkH1An>.

US Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, at a town hall meeting last night, 
was rushed by a man <https://bloom.bg/3M0wNWO> the Associated Press reported 
has made pro-Trump social media posts <https://bloom.bg/46knPuh>. Addressing 
the attack today, Trump—who has regularly made racially-tinged remarks about 
Omar to his followers—derided her further <https://bloom.bg/4qXUQok>.

Omar, however, was the second Democratic member of Congress to be attacked in 
less than a week. TheAP reported that Representative Maxwell Frost of Florida 
was punched in the face Friday night by a manspouting racial epithets and 
claiming Trump would deport him <https://bloom.bg/4t5fncb>. 

During her town hall, Omar urged the removal of federal agents from Minnesota, 
a possibility US Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly alluded to in a letter 
demanding access to the blue state’s voter roles. Democrats assailed what they 
said was Bondi’s “ransom note <https://bloom.bg/4rf6meN>” and how Trump is 
allegedly seeking to use state voter information to muddy the upcoming midterm 
elections.

On Wednesday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, directed by Trump loyalist 
Kash Patel, launched a search of the main election office in Fulton County, 
Georgia, a raid reportedly tied to Trump’s false claims about the 2020 
elections. CNN also reported that theFBI planned to seize some of the office’s 
election records <https://bloom.bg/4ajxxzs>.

The Trump administration on Wednesday threatened to attack two different 
countries for a second time. President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran as 
US naval ships arrive inthe Middle East <https://bloom.bg/4qUrkjG>. The Iranian 
government has killed thousands of protestors in demonstrations over the past 
several weeks. Trump ordered a surprise attack on Iran last year aimed at its 
nuclear research facilities.

As for Venezuela, Trump’s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, told Congress that 
Trump is prepared toattack the South American country again 
<https://bloom.bg/3NKQse0>. US forces reportedly killed 100 people earlier this 
month as part of its renditioning of President Nicolas Maduro from Caracas. 
Trump, who originally sought to justify his targeting of Venezuela and civilian 
boats in the Caribbean over drugs, has since focusedlargely on controlling the 
country’s oil reserves <https://bloom.bg/3NJ3Cbj>.

Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol delivered the best evidence yet 
thathis turnaround plan is taking hold <https://bloom.bg/45APKWC>, with the 
coffee chain posting unexpectedly strong growth and a solid outlook for the 
rest of the year.

Global sales at established locations rose 4% in the most recent quarter, the 
company said in a statement. That topped even the most optimistic analyst 
expectations and built onpositive results <https://bloom.bg/45yyrpd> from the 
previous period after a lengthy slump.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani is amping up pressure on Governor Kathy 
Hochul tohike taxes for the richest residents <https://bloom.bg/4bVnemr> and 
corporations, asking the state to send billions of dollars more in aid to the 
Big Apple as he faces mounting budget holes left behind by ex-mayor Eric Adams.

Mamdani is arguing additional money from the state is necessary because the 
city faces a fiscal “crisis” created by budget decisions under the previous 
administration, and by a push from former Governor Andrew Cuomo to shift costs 
from the state onto the city.
