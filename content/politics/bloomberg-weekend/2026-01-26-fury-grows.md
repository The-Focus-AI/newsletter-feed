When Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse who cared for ailing veterans 
<https://bloom.bg/4regNzg>, was—as shown by several bystander videos 
<https://bloom.bg/4qE1WhJ>—knocked to the ground, beaten and shot multiple 
times in the back <https://bloom.bg/3M9k9op> by heavily armed immigration 
agents in Minneapolis, he became the second US citizen killed as part of Donald 
Trump’s dragnet there.

At least six people have died so far <https://bloom.bg/4qL5LSq> nationwide. 
And as was the case earlier this month in the killing of Renee Good, a 
37-year-old mother of three, Trump and his top aides immediately sought to cast 
blame on the victim. Also as in the case of Good, many of their unsubstantiated 
allegations were quickly contradicted by an onslaught of video footage.

Trump, after a call with Governor Tim Walz on Monday, made vague comments 
about potential compromise <https://bloom.bg/4qE1XSP> on removing some agents 
from Minnesota. On Capitol Hill, however, Democrats who recently folded in 
their bid for renewed healthcare subsidiesrevived threats of a government 
shutdown <https://bloom.bg/4qOmapk> over funding for the US immigration 
agencies. And Minnesota officials urged a federal judge totemporarily halt the 
administration’s surge of immigration <https://bloom.bg/4q1B8a2> raids in the 
state.

Loeb/AFP/Getty Images 
But even with news of potential action in Washington, protests across the 
country and in Minneapolis surged over the weekend,as did tributes to Pretti 
<https://bloom.bg/4pYXVDm>. The Associated Press reported on a video posted to 
social media showing himreading a final salute <https://bloom.bg/4qE1ZKr> at 
the foot of the body of an Air Force veteran who died at a hospital in 2024. 
Former colleagues reportedly recounted Pretti as a “sweet, kind man 
<https://bloom.bg/4pYXVDm>.”

Videos taken of the events Saturday showed Pretti filming immigration agents 
as they shoved a woman to the ground, his efforts to help her up, his getting 
thrown to the ground, beaten and shot dead. The Trump administration quickly 
claimed without providing evidence the shots were “defensive.” (AWashington Post
 analysis of footage showed Pretti’s licensed sidearm had beentaken off of him 
<https://bloom.bg/4qL5Oh4> before agents opened fire.)

Pretti’s family called the effort by the Trump administration to characterize 
the intensive care unit nurse as an aggressor “sickening lies 
<https://bloom.bg/45tujqv>” and “reprehensible and disgusting.” In the 
aftermath of the killing of Good, whom multiple video analyses showed pulling 
away from agents in her car before being shot in the head, reports surfaced 
that federal agents were allegedly referring to her killing as awarning to 
other protestors <https://bloom.bg/4k2D3dk>. The Associated Press reported that 
an immigration agent, confronted on Saturday by an outraged crowd following 
Pretti’s killing, responded to them by saying “boo hoo 
<https://bloom.bg/4qE23tF>.” —David E. Rovella <https://bloom.bg/42IzHFH>

Shares of major US insurers tumbled after the Trump administration proposed 
holding payments to private Medicare plans flat next year. Shares of 
UnitedHealth Group fell as much as 9.3% in afterhours trading in New York 
Monday, while CVS dropped as much as 10% and Humana sank more than 15%.

Medicare Advantage payment rates will rise by just 0.09% in 2027, the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a release. Analystshad been 
expecting an increase as high as 6% <https://bloom.bg/4qHHNrd>. The update will 
mean barely any increase for Medicare insurers that have seen profits squeezed 
by rising care expenses and what they call insufficient funding from the 
government.

And the wheel keeps turning for circular AI deals as critics warn of an 
ever-growing bubble that could blow up the stock market. Nvidia, the dominant 
maker of artificial intelligence chips and the primary force behind said 
potential bubble, invested an additional$2 billion in cloud computing firm and 
key customer CoreWeave <https://bloom.bg/3YWpeU1>.

Nvidia has been using its enormous resources to propel the broader AI industry 
by partnering with and heavily investing in its own customers. The world’s most 
valuable company has pledged tens of billions of dollars toward AI companies 
that use its chips and is bankrolling the deployment of new infrastructure 
that’s critical to sustaining demand for its products.

What are Europe’s options for pushing back against Trump? From his ambitions 
to acquire Greenland to his retracted (for now) threats of tariffs on European 
countries that oppose him, Trump continues to alienate the EU’s member states. 
But they’re aligned on one thing: The continent needs to be ready to stand on 
its own,and fast <https://bloom.bg/4rk4a66>.

While Trump has been focused on potentially invading Greenland, an earlier 
conquest seems to besquirming under Washington’s thumb 
<https://bloom.bg/4qE2cxd>. Acting President Delcy Rodríguez said Venezuela has 
“had enough” of US interference as the government faces growing pushback from 
public-sector groups and leftist parties over plans to overhaul the oil 
industry.

Rodríguez’s comments come before a second and final debate of the hydrocarbons 
law in the government-controlled National Assembly, with a public consultation 
set for Monday. The message from Rodríguez could be aimed at shoring up the 
government’s political base even as Caracas cooperates with demands from 
Trump’s administration, including prisoner releases and the oil bill reform.

Uruguay’s central bank slashed its benchmark interest rate a full percentage 
point to 6.5%, as inflation risks slowing too far below its target. The cut on 
Monday was thebiggest since the central bank resumed using interest rates 
<https://bloom.bg/3NEmdVT> as its main monetary policy tool during the 
pandemic. Policymakers have lowered borrowing costs by 275 basis points since 
beginning the current easing cycle in July 2025.

As global investors seek to diversify out of the US dollar, emerging market 
currencies have been strengthening across the board. Swings have been 
particularly intense for currencies trading in relatively small markets such as 
the Uruguayan peso.
