Welcome to the weekend!

Lululemon paused online sales of a new line of leggings because of a certain 
awkward complaint — the same one that plagued the company in 2013. What’s the 
issue? Find out with thePointed <https://bloom.bg/3E93pJQ> quiz. 

Speaking of gripes, tune in to this weekend’s episode of The Mishal Husain Show
 <https://bloom.bg/4o25yc7> for a conversation with Dutch historian Rutger 
Bregman, who has made a habit of needling the wealthy for not doing more to 
improve the world.

 Middle Power Problems 

In 2021, the humdrum opening of a Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania 
prompted China to restrict trade and investment with the former Soviet 
republic, spurring the EU to create a new tool to counter economic coercion. 
Then, Beijing was the bloc’s chief bully. Now, as Donald Trump batters the 
rules-based order, EU leaders are deepening ties with Beijing and weighing 
whether to deploy that same tool against the US. Call it the Donroe Paradox, 
Daniel Ten Kate writes: Trump’s bid to fence China out of the Western 
Hemisphere is lifting the country’s standing elsewhere.

If Trump’s rhetoric — especially on Greenland — is pushing EU leaders toward 
China, it’s also persuading them that the era of appeasement is over. The term, 
coined in the 1930s to describe Britain and France’s acquiescence to Germany’s 
territorial ambitions, has been invoked repeatedly in response to Trump’s 
threats to annex the Arctic island. But as historians have noted, “appeasement” 
is misleading shorthand for a strategy that also relied on deterrence, 
including costly and sustained rearmament. It’s a hard lesson that Europe would 
do well to relearn ASAP, Simon Nixon writes.

Trump started the week in full Greenland-threat mode and ended it touting a 
“framework” for a deal. The lack of detail is no surprise. Many of his deals 
aren’t deals in the conventional sense — binding agreements with clear, 
accepted terms — but pledges, frameworks or other opaque arrangements that 
allow him to claim a win and move on. That may be true to the ethos ofThe Art 
of the Deal(“I play it very loose,” Trump wrote), but amid fears of a global 
trade war and a fraying NATO, the political and economic risks of a US 
president governing like a real estate developer are getting harder to ignore.

If the new world order is defined by fragmentation and rivalry, no one has 
told the tourists. The United Nations recently reported that international 
arrivals hit 1.52 billion in 2025, nearly 4% above their 2019 high watermark. 
More than half of those were in Europe, where multiple cities are buckling 
under overtourism. Museums can manage crowds; neighborhoods and local haunts 
cannot — especially when visitors are all chasing the same social-media photo. 
So what’s an overcrowded city to do? The answers are nuanced, Madison 
Darbyshire writes, but more cities are turning to blunt tools, including higher 
prices, to keep the tourists in check.

 The Long Con 

 “Now we can sleep <https://bloom.bg/4sOw8Iu>.” 
 Growing up, Ugandan children learned of Idi Amin’s rule through hushed 
stories — told with relief that he was gone and that his successor, Yoweri 
Museveni, promised reform. But four decades later, Mahmood Mamdani (the father 
of New York City’s new mayor) argues that Uganda is again coming apart under 
Museveni, as repression, corruption and political violence reassert themselves. 

 Agree or Disagree? 

Finance is wasting a generation of talent. Dutch historian Rutger Bregman — 
who went viral for excoriating the rich on the Davos stage in 2019 — says that 
too many of the world’s smartest graduates are funneled into finance, law and 
consultinginstead of tackling problems that matter <https://bloom.bg/49RESVB>.

Europe is entering the age of humiliation. Once a driver of history, Europe is 
increasinglyreduced to reacting as others set the agenda 
<https://bloom.bg/3NAnZr7> — dependent on allies for security, exposed to 
economic coercion, and struggling with inertia.

Fossil fuels’ critics have no moral high ground. In Vigil, George Saunders’ 
second novel, a dying oil CEO is pressed to repent for climate change, only to 
lash out at his accusers: “You drove, you flew,you kombucha-making hypocrite 
<https://bloom.bg/49PF47J>.”

Bond markets are the world’s quiet enforcers. As global politics fragment, 
investors are increasingly setting the limits of what governments can promise, 
and Europe is waking up to theleverage that could give it over the US 
<https://bloom.bg/4acK6wr>.

 Is It Worth It? 

A Diet Coke: Gross, mom. Across the soda aisle, Diet is out and Zero Sugar is 
in <https://bloom.bg/49PEZkr> as the latter’s branding resonates more with 
younger, wellness-minded consumers who shun sugar but don’t vibe with 
calorie-counting or diet culture.

A McDonald’s chile oil sundae: If you dare! Social media and chile-induced 
endorphins have dinersseeking out palate-numbing flavors 
<https://bloom.bg/4bcBjf5> their parents or grandparents would rarely have 
considered — or even encountered.

A pint of London Black: Definitely. The nitro porter was named the UK’s No. 1 
beer last year <https://bloom.bg/4bcBdUL>, a victory the judges attributed to a 
Guinness-led stout resurgence and the rise of more moderated drinking. (One 
Guinness is usually plenty.)

A glass of premium… water? Sommeliers think so. Danone, whose water brands 
include Evian, Volvic and Badoit,employs four water sommeliers 
<https://bloom.bg/4td9cmC> to test new varieties and persuade consumers to pay 
for something that’s free from the tap.

A Dorset vacation: Yes! The county in southwest England is known for its food 
and countryside retreats, but remainsrelatively undiscovered by foreign tourists
 <https://bloom.bg/45pYSxo>. That makes it a compelling alternative to the 
increasingly overcrowded Cotswolds.

 <https://bloom.bg/49RfBee> 
“This is one of the great stories of the world.”  <https://bloom.bg/49RfBee> 
Twenty-five years after A.I. Artificial Intelligence premiered, science 
fiction writer Ian Watson revisits his collaboration with Stanley Kubrick — 
from inventing the sex robot Gigolo Joe to grappling with Kubrick’s seriousness 
about machine intelligence. The irony, Watson suggests, is that Kubrick’s most 
advanced AI ultimately became obsessed not with power or knowledge, but with 
human life.
