A winter storm expected to be  the largest of the season 
<https://bloom.bg/49MMkml> is already causing major disruptions across the US, 
with airlines cutting more than 2,300 flights. Dallas-Fort Worth International 
Airport will be one of the hardest hit with more than 60% of scheduled trips to 
and from the hub canceled for Saturday. Nashville and Memphis will also see a 
large number of cancellations.
 <https://bloom.bg/4renSQD> 
The storm is expected to span nearly 1,500 miles, <https://bloom.bg/4renSQD> 
bringing heavy snow, crippling ice and subzero wind chill to some of the 
biggest US cities, threatening power outages for much of the nation. A mix of 
freezing rain and snow is expected to arrive in Texas by tonight. Heavy snow 
will likely start falling across New York City early Sunday, with more than 14 
inches possible throughout the metro area before the storm subsides late Monday.

 What You Need to Know Today 

During a week in which the world was focused on Donald Trump’s very public 
desire to annex Greenland, US immigration and security agencies were 
intensifying their Minnesota dragnet andtriggering fresh public fury 
<https://bloom.bg/4jW7yl5> almost daily.

The Justice Department began the week by opening criminal investigations 
<https://bloom.bg/45wpcWC> of Democratic Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis 
Mayor Jacob Frey. Trump also extended his immigration campaign to Maine this 
week, a Democratic-led state with a significant population of Somali Americans, 
a group he has regularly denigrated. The governor of Maine, Jane Mills, famously
clashed with the president <https://bloom.bg/4r2W9SO> and has been at the 
forefront ofpushing back <https://bloom.bg/468t4Ny> against his agenda. 

Federal agents reportedly broke into a US citizen’s home in Minnesota and 
forced him into sub-zerotemperatures in his underwear <https://bloom.bg/4ra2sE0>
. CNN reported a family caught between agents and protestors was tear gassed, 
allegedly forcing a mother toperform CPR on her baby <https://bloom.bg/4k0moHc>.

An autopsy report commissioned by the family of Renee Good, the 37-year-old 
mother of three killed by Immigration and Naturalization Enforcement agent 
Jonathan Ross, revealed she was shot three times, including oncethrough her head
 <https://bloom.bg/45v0Kox>. In the aftermath of her death, reports surfaced 
that ICE agents have allegedly referred to her killing as awarning to protestors
 <https://bloom.bg/4k2D3dk>.

and Customs Enforcement agents in Minneapolis on Sunday. The US is taking steps

its unprecedented campaign.Photographer: Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg 
While the Trump administration declined to open a civil rights investigation 
into Good’s killing, this week it sought to do soover a protest against ICE at 
a local church <https://bloom.bg/4reToxS>. The White House then reportedly used 
artificial intelligence to change the image <https://bloom.bg/4qDNKpb> of one 
of the protestors to portray her as crying during her arrest.

Meanwhile, another autopsy found that a man in ICE custody in Texas was in 
fact killed,contradicting Trump administration claims <https://bloom.bg/4jU4fL2>
 he committed suicide. News broke of an internal immigration agency memo 
casting aside traditional constitutional protections by saying awarrant written 
by a federal agency <https://bloom.bg/4jSoKaU>—as opposed to one approved by a 
judge—is enough to forcibly enter a home.

But the biggest story in Trump’s immigration crackdown this week revolved 
around a five-year-old boy in a bunny ear hat, bundled up against the cold. 
Liam Ramos was, according to his family, used as “bait” by immigration agents 
to lure family members out of their home, an allegation the government denied. 
The administration reportedly claimed its agents were trying to get the boy 
inside.

Detained along with his father, both of whom their lawyer say are in the US 
legally, Ramos was nevertheless shipped across the country to a Texas detention 
facility. His image meanwhilehas become a rallying point 
<https://bloom.bg/3Nufzl8> for Minnesotans who took to the streets Friday in a 
mass demonstrationamid arctic temperatures <https://bloom.bg/49BEpIm>.

Goldman Sachs boosted Chief Executive Officer David Solomon’s pay to $47 
million,his biggest award <https://bloom.bg/4raHWTS> ever and capping a year in 
which the investment bank’s shares soared. The board handed Solomon a $2 
million base salary and $45 million as a bonus in the form of shares, cash and 
carried interest. That’s a 21% increase from his 2024 pay, when he wasawarded 
<https://bloom.bg/4aczL3G> a $39 million package, as well as a major multiyear 
retention bonus.

The figure came in higher than the $43 million awarded 
<https://bloom.bg/46b3QOB> to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon for 2025. Under 
Solomon’s leadership last year, Goldmanposted <https://bloom.bg/4bNuNeP> record 
revenue in its banking and markets division and record management fees in its 
asset-management business.

The collapse of a small but politically connected Brazilian lender is pulling 
the country’s Supreme Court into what is shaping up to be its most serious 
credibility crisis since the return of democracy more than four decades ago.

After a months-long investigation into alleged financial fraud, the nation’s 
central bank liquidated <https://bloom.bg/3LHvxI1> Banco Master SA in November, 
triggering shockwaves through Brasilia. The lender’s chief executive, Daniel 
Vorcaro, had spent years cultivating ties to powerful politicians and public 
officials in the nation’s capital, turning the bank into a fixture of its 
political and business circles. While it remains unclear how many senior 
politicians or business leaders may ultimately be implicated, the fallout is 
already straining core institutions, from thecentral bank 
<https://bloom.bg/49F4jLn> to Congress.

For the Supreme Court, the stakes are particularly high. At least two of its 
11 justices—Dias Toffoli and Alexandre de Moraes—have come under scrutiny over 
alleged links to Banco Master, placingthe court itself at the center of a 
scandal <https://bloom.bg/45rXHxp>.

 An Untethered Trump Is Expanding Xi’s Sphere of Influence  
<https://bloom.bg/3NJmo28> 
By hollowing out the rules-based order, the US president is pushing middle 
powers to hedge, and giving Beijing a brand new opening.

The yen abruptly staged its biggest one-day surge since August on speculation 
that Japanese authorities could be preparing to mount a market intervention 
<https://bloom.bg/4sYb9mu> to halt the currency’s slide 
<https://bloom.bg/4bORKyk>. The yen rallied as much as 1.7% to 155.69 per 
dollar, extending gains seen during the Asian trading day to its strongest 
level of the year. The moves reversed what had been a steady slide toward 
levels last seen in 2024, when Japan stepped in to buy the currency.
 <https://bloom.bg/4sYb9mu> 
The jump in the US session came as traders reported that the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York had called financial institutions to ask about the yen’s 
exchange rate. Wall Street saw it as an indication that the bank was preparing 
to assist Japanese officials to intervene directly in the currency market to 
prop up the yen.

Ecuador is planning to raise as much as $4 billion in its first bond sale 
since 2019, which could come as soon as next week. Officials from the South 
American nation have signaled to investors that they are considering a 
multi-tranche deal involving intermediate maturities. The government is also 
interested in selling a 30-year maturity.

The potential deal comes amid a sale spree in bond markets. Emerging-market 
sovereigns alone have sold $65 billion <https://bloom.bg/4jXrSCn> in 
hard-currency debt this year through Thursday, an increase of more than 75% 
from the same period in 2025, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
