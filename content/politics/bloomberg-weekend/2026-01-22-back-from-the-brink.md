Markets got their mojo back as soon as Donald Trump dropped his tariff threat 
<https://bloom.bg/3ZpOvG9> against Europe and ruled out using force to seize 
Greenland, easing geopolitical and trade tensions. Chip stocks rallied after 
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the global AI buildout willrequire trillions in 
investment <https://bloom.bg/49xGWmO>. Investors aren’t spooked by sky-high 
valuations. “This time it’s different <https://bloom.bg/49QGQWm>,” said an 
analyst at researcher IDC. The fervor even gave a Japanese toilet makeran 
unlikely boost <https://bloom.bg/49Xod3c>. Meanwhile, Ray Dalio sees an ongoing 
diversification <https://bloom.bg/4bcvjD8> away from US assets.

Trump returned to the Davos stage to launch his “Board of Peace,” 
<https://bloom.bg/3NYF8L2> an initiative raising more questions 
<https://bloom.bg/3NxUVR5> than it answers. He’s also due to meet Ukrainian 
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy <https://bloom.bg/4sTUzV4>, while US envoys Steve 
Witkoff and Jared Kushner head to Russia for talks on proposals to end the war 
in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin says he’s willing tocommit Russian 
assets <https://bloom.bg/49NHK61> frozen in the US to rebuild damaged Ukrainian 
regions after a peace deal, including a possible $1 billion for Trump’s peace 
board. Follow the latest from the Swiss Alps in ourlive blog

A sweeping US crypto market bill is likely to be delayed by several weeks 
<https://bloom.bg/4bdfEDt> as lawmakers shift their focus to housing 
legislation. The crypto industry issteaming ahead <https://bloom.bg/3NXqsvJ>, 
though, with plans to list shares. BitGo and some of its backers raised more 
than $200 million, giving it a market value of more than $2 billion. It’s the 
custodian and infrastructure provider for USD1, stablecoin of the Trump-linked 
World Liberty Financial.

Brrrr. Record-breaking cold across the central and eastern US is fueling the 
season’s largest winter storm <https://bloom.bg/4bbVKIZ>, threatening to freeze 
Texas, halt flights, ice power lines and possibly drop snow on New York City 
this weekend. US natural gas futures rallied to the highest level since 2022 on 
concerns the deep freeze couldthreaten supplies <https://bloom.bg/4bcvmPk> just 
as demand jumps.

 Deep Dive: The Truth About Venezuela’s Oil Reserves 

 <https://bloom.bg/4pUUsFY> An oil pumpjack on Lake Maracaibo in Cabimas, 
Zulia state, Venezuela.Photographer: Bloomberg 
On paper, Venezuela has enough oil reserves to keep pumping at current levels 
formore than 800 years <https://bloom.bg/4pUUsFY>. Even if that’s far from the 
truth, it helps explain why Venezuela remains attractive to companies like 
Chevron and ConocoPhillips in a world with dwindling opportunities to 
substantially bulk up balance-sheet reserves.

 * For some investors keen to get in on the act, all the talk is little more 
than a red herring. “Even if the reserves were 50 billion barrels, rather than 
300 billion barrels, Venezuela could produce 3 million barrels for 45 years,” 
said Luis Pacheco, a former senior PDVSA executive. 
 * Meanwhile, rates to ship crude on tankers are surging more widely across 
the world after the US moved to exert control over Venezuelan flows, a trade 
once mainly handled by a dark fleet of aging vessels <https://bloom.bg/4bdfETZ>
. Europe is set to receive some of its first shipments 
<https://bloom.bg/4pPJVM4> of Venezuelan oil in nearly a year. 
 * Venezuela’s legislature will discuss oil reforms on Thursday that, if 
implemented, will unwind the state monopoly <https://bloom.bg/3LRX9tQ> on the 
industry and let private companies produce and sell crude from the country’s 
reserves. 

 The Big Take

Wall Street executives are treading carefully to avoid provoking Trump’s ire 
while helping clients navigate his policies. Self-censorship is growing 
<https://bloom.bg/49zh7mr>, with some firms urging employees to avoid 
commentary on US-China tensions and other hot-button topics.

 Opinion 

There might be a conspicuous lack of details about the Greenland “framework,” 
but it still moved markets, John Authers writes. The TACO trade—or“Trump 
Tamatigut Qunutittarpoq <https://bloom.bg/4qaZ9vH>,” as they say in 
Greenland—is back.
