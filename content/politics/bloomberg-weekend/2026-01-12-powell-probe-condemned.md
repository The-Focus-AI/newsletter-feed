Three former heads of the US Federal Reserve and four former Treasury 
secretaries in Democratic and Republican administrations decried a criminal 
probe ordered up by the Trump administration into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the 
latest unprecedented escalation under Donald Trump and one which they warned 
will furtherundermine the central bank’s independence <https://bloom.bg/45uggB9>
.

“This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak 
institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the 
functioning of their economies more broadly,” the former officials said. “It 
has no place in the United States, whose greatest strength is the rule of law, 
which is at the foundation of our economic success.” Former Fed Chairs Janet 
Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, the only three living past chairs, 
signed the statement. A few Republicans on Capitol Hillvoiced concern 
<https://bloom.bg/49y7wuR> about the administration’s move against Powell as 
well, a rare break with more common expressions of unswerving party support.

“Sell America <https://bloom.bg/3LJr4V4>” sentiment rippled through markets 
<https://bloom.bg/4pADZ9S> on Monday morning, but even the administration’s 
globally destabilizing attack <https://bloom.bg/4qQohIG> on Powell—ostensibly 
over arenovation project <https://bloom.bg/4qQoifI>—wasn’t enough to convince 
equity investors anything major was awry. Wall Street managed to recoverby 
day’s end <https://bloom.bg/49y6mPN>. —Natasha Solo-Lyons

 Powell Needs to Stay at the Fed Now More Than Ever  <https://bloom.bg/45J0UZp>

While a handful of Republicans try to work with Democrats to undo the GOP’s 
successful effort in blocking the renewal of Affordable Care Act subsidies, 
their party’s leader said this weekendhe may veto any new bill that results 
<https://bloom.bg/3YEBBnt>.

Trump’s casual remark on Air Force Once came after nine swing-district House 
Republicans joined Democrats last week in advancing legislation to revive the 
subsidies for three years. The Senate has yet to vote on the measure,where it’s 
unlikely <https://bloom.bg/3Lc6Bbt> Democrats will overcome Republican 
opposition to reinstating the subsidies, relied on by millions of Americans who 
are otherwise unable to afford coverage.

Paramount ratcheted up the stakes in the monthslong battle for Warner Bros., 
saying it plans to nominate directors to the board to thwart a merger with 
Netflix. The company, run by David Ellison, alsosaid it filed a lawsuit against 
Warner Bros. <https://bloom.bg/3Nh61K2> in an attempt to force into the open 
more details about Netflix’s $82.7 billion takeover agreement. Paramount has 
been pursuing Warner Bros. for four months and has submitted multiple offers 
for the iconic Hollywood studio, all of which have been rebuffed by Warner

Alphabet surpassed $4 trillion market capitalization <https://bloom.bg/4pGEUFR>
 on Monday, becoming one of the few companies to ever cross the threshold as 
investors increasingly see the Google parent as one of the biggest winners of 
the artificial intelligence boom.

Shares rose during the day by as much as 1.7% to hit $334.04, translating to a 
market cap of $4 trillion. The company recently overtook Apple to become the 
second-largest firm, behind Nvidia. Only Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft have 
topped the $4 trillion barrier, and Nvidia remains the lone company to ever 
crest $5 trillion.

The Covid pandemic didn’t just kill people directly. It appears to have 
accelerated a long-brewing reversal in US heart failure deaths 
<https://bloom.bg/3Z9zxE9>, with mortality climbing faster since 2020 after 
years of decline, new research shows. The increases have been most pronounced 
among younger adults and Black Americans, pointing to disruptions in care and 
worsening conditions such as diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure that 
intensified during the health emergency, according to a study published Monday 
in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Heart failure has emerged 
as one of the clearest signals of the pandemic’s lasting impact on chronic 
disease.
