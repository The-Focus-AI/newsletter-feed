Welcome back to The Forecast <https://bloom.bg/4grD73x> from Bloomberg Weekend 
<https://bloom.bg/3ZHmDgw>, where we help you think about the future — from 
next week to next decade.

This weekend, two friends of the Forecast look at how even the dot-com era’s 
internet optimists were too conservative in their projections — and what that 
means for AI. Plus, the US may shrink this year, prediction markets think 
there’s a better-than-even chance of more US strikes on Iran, and new male 
birth control options may be coming soon.

 Dot-com Optimists Got More Right Than Wrong 

This weekend we have an analysis from Avi Goldfarb, the Rotman Chair in AI & 
Healthcare at the University of Toronto, and Dylan Litman, an MBA graduate of 
the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management.

In March 2000, the Nasdaq peaked at 5,048 points, having risen 582% 
<https://bloom.bg/4qcXlST> over the previous five years as investors poured 
billions into internet startups. Then the bubble burst: Over the next two 
years, the index plummeted 78%.

Today, the world is debating the existence of a similar bubble around 
artificial intelligence, and the dot-com crash is often invoked as a warning or 
even a rebuttal to AI boosters.

At the time, the crash seemed to validate skeptics who had warned that the 
internet revolution was nothing more than speculative mania. Among the most 
prominent casualties of this reckoning were the Wall Street analysts who had 
championed internet stocks throughout the late 1990s – none more so than Morgan 
Stanley’s Mary Meeker. Once dubbed the “Queen of the Net” by Barron’s 
<https://bloom.bg/4kcuM6w>, Meeker was heavily criticized after the market 
crashed;PBS described her <https://bloom.bg/4kcL7s3> as emblematic of “the 
intellectual hollowness of the Internet bubble’s headiest days.”

But with the benefit of decades of hindsight, it’s clear that Meeker was 
actually surprisingly accurate in her predictions about the size and direction 
of the internet economy. If anything, she was conservative. And by looking back 
at her track record, we can glean lessons on what we can expect from AI.

Over the summer, Dylan evaluated 86 distinct predictions 
<https://bloom.bg/45GsbvB> from Meeker’s Internet Trends Reports — highly 
influential deep dives <https://bloom.bg/4bYIrMj> — published between 1995 and 
1997. He then compared each one against data from sources such as Statista, the 
US Census and government reports, categorizing the predictions as conservative, 
accurate, partially accurate or wrong.

Many of these predictions were qualitative; grading them was partly a 
subjective exercise. Nonetheless, they reveal a striking pattern: While many of 
Meeker’s boldest projections seemed wildly optimistic at the time, the vast 
majority proved not only directionally correct but often modest in hindsight.

Her forecasts on user growth, global adoption, e-commerce and digital 
advertising, for example, were often surpassed by reality. In 1995, she 
projected 7% global internet penetration by 2010; theactual figure 
<https://bloom.bg/4kcQkzY> reached 29%. That same year, she anticipated $36 
billion in revenue from new internet businesses by 2000, but revenuesexceeded 
$171 billion in 1999 <https://bloom.bg/4q7Zn6s>. By 2000, the number of 
internet users had reached 361 million <https://bloom.bg/4c05wOD>, over double 
her 1995 estimate of 150 million.

While Meeker predicted in 1996 that online advertising budgets would increase, 
she did not anticipate that eventually63% of total media spending 
<https://bloom.bg/4c1lSGQ> would be allocated to online channels. Also in 1996, 
even her boldest internet advertising forecast of $7.6 billion by the year 2000 
fell short of the$8.2 billion achieved <https://bloom.bg/4k7dTKB>. She also 
warned of volatility surrounding internet investment. In 1995, she predicted 
forthcoming “periods of investor enthusiasm and depression” and cautioned that 
rapid growth would inevitably be followed by shakeout and consolidation. Just a 
few years later, the dot-com crash validated that perspective.

Meeker wasn’t right about everything: Her specific company picks often missed. 
In 1997, she foresaw the multibillion-dollar online retail market, but 
predicted firms like Barnes & Noble and CUC (originallya phone-based shopping 
service <https://bloom.bg/46aCHeK>) would dominate it, citing them as 
relatively safe investment picks. That same year, Meeker identified Amazon as a 
potential leader in online book sales, though she underestimated the magnitude 
of its eventual dominance. In 1995, Meeker also saw Netscape as a long-term 
browser winner (alongside Microsoft).

What should we take from this retrospective tour of the dot-com era’s foremost 
financial analyst? First, it seems easier to chart a technology’s path broadly 
than to pick the companies that will emerge as its chief champions and/or 
beneficiaries. Second, while short-term exuberance around new, transformational 
technologies like AI may come and go, in the long term they can far exceed even 
the most ambitious forecasts.

 Predictions 

The US population could shrink this year, for the first time ever. Independent 
estimates of net migration for 2026 suggestthe nation is flirting with 
population decline <https://bloom.bg/4a6Udln>, decades ahead of schedule. — 
Shawn Donnan, Bloomberg Weekend

The Warsh pick for Fed chair will satisfy no one — including Trump. “If he 
lowers interest rates, markets will perceive him as a Trump lackey who has 
abandoned his principles. If he holds rates high for too long, he’ll beat 
loggerheads with the president in no time <https://bloom.bg/45JO3X3> — and that 
will generate volatility of its own.”— Jonathan Levin, Bloomberg Opinion

New male birth control options are coming. They include pills, gels and surgery
 <https://bloom.bg/4qLmvZI>; the question is whether men will buy in. — Ana 
Castelain, Bloomberg Businessweek 

Germany’s auto unions could become more right-wing. “Zentrum [is] a 
fast-growing far-right union that’s challenging IG Metall, the 2 million-member 
movement that has dominated German labor relations since the 1950s… The group 
unabashedly promotes a right-wing, nationalist agenda,aiming to turn factories 
into political incubators <https://bloom.bg/3M0rVRy> in much the way Italian 
and German leftist radicals did in the 1960s and ’70s.”— William Wilkes, 
Bloomberg Businessweek 

AI will decode the “dark genome.” “DNA sequencing… is by now cheap and easy. 
Deciphering the billions of letters in that code, however, is another story…
Enter DeepMind’s AlphaGenome <https://bloom.bg/4q76M5Z>.” The platform could 
potentially predict the impact of genetic diseases and accelerate the 
development of genetic medicine.— Lisa Jarvis, Bloomberg Opinion

 What Are the Chances... 

Will the US Strike Iran?

A US aircraft carrier group arrived in the Middle East this week 
<https://bloom.bg/4a9QW4O>, as the White House intensified its pressure on Iran 
<https://bloom.bg/4bOdpab>. Traders on Polymarket put the chance 
<https://bloom.bg/4qbRqxj> of a US strike on Iran in February at 50% — and the 
chance of a strike by the end of June at 68%. (Forecasts as of 2:15 p.m. ET on 
Friday.)

 Week Ahead 

Sunday: Officials from Ukraine, Russia and the US are expected to meet in the 
UAE; Costa Rica holds its presidential and parliamentary elections.

Monday: Palantir and Walt Disney report earnings; Indonesia and Pakistan 
report CPI.

Tuesday: The US publishes job openings; the Reserve Bank of Australia will 
leave rates unchanged; France and South Korea report CPI.

Wednesday: Alphabet and UBS report earnings; the Eurozone reports CPI.

Thursday: The ECB and the BOE are expected to leave rates unchanged; Amazon 
reports earnings.

Friday: The US reports jobs data; the Reserve Bank of India is expected to cut 
a quarter point.
