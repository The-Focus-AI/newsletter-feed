Good morning. The US wants total access for its military in Greenland. China

bring growth back to Crocs?Listen to the day’s top stories

Testing NATO. The US wants to rewrite its 1951 defense agreement with Denmark, 
last amended in 2004, toremove limits on its military presence 
<https://bloom.bg/3ZxJSd6> in Greenland. Donald Trump also floated invoking 
NATO’s collective defense clause <https://bloom.bg/3LHhW3t> to secure America’s 
southern border.

The president said his new Board of Peace is disinviting Mark Carney 
<https://bloom.bg/3ZuGwrm> after the Canadian PM’s blistering Davos speech 
warning <https://bloom.bg/49SRKeb> against coercion by the world’s great 
powers. Carneydoubled down <https://bloom.bg/4jUNX4L>, saying: “The arc of 
history isn’t destined to be warped towards authoritarianism and exclusion.”

Forget Greenland, get diversified. That’s the message from strategists 
<https://bloom.bg/3NASXzp> bullish on 2026. Officials in Beijing have told 
China’s big tech firms <https://bloom.bg/4aa7fQb> that they can prepare orders 
for Nvidia's H200 AI chips. But the industry’sdense web of interlinked bets 
<https://bloom.bg/49MghBC> risks cascading losses if expectations disappoint. 
Meanwhile,“quiet-quitting” of US assets <https://bloom.bg/3LHhYs7> is fueling a 
boom in bets from emerging markets to gold. US futures point toback-to-back 
weekly losses <https://bloom.bg/4t37nZp> for the S&P 500 for the first time 
since June, even as Wall Streetlearns to navigate <https://bloom.bg/4baKBIv> 
Trump’s habit of reversing course when markets push back. JPMorgan shares 
shrugged off his $5 billion lawsuitalleging politically-motivated debanking 
<https://bloom.bg/4a95wdY>.

Four hours of talks on Ukraine between Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner and 
Vladimir Putin sputtered over“the territorial issue.” <https://bloom.bg/3ZsOvoV>
 Until that’s resolved, there’s “no hope of achieving a long-term settlement,” 
a Kremlin aide said. Three-way talks are set for the United Arab Emirates today 
and Saturday. Europe’s attention is pivoting back to Kyiv aftera fractious week 
with the US president <https://bloom.bg/3LHi0Af> and after Ukraine’s Volodymyr 
Zelenskiyblasted his neighbors <https://bloom.bg/4by9n5F> for their apparent 
unwillingness to stop Putin in his tracks.
 <https://bloom.bg/4pXLY0V> 
In corporate news, TikTok signed a long-awaited deal to transfer parts of its 
US operations <https://bloom.bg/4jYHWUL> to American investors, including 
Oracle and Silver Lake, avoiding a nationwide ban. China isdeepening its review 
<https://bloom.bg/3YVA2l9> of Meta’s $2 billion takeover of AI startup Manus. 
Chinese companies are expected to be leading contenders when Brazil holds its 
first electricity auction for grid-scale batteries in April,potentially bidding 
against Tesla <https://bloom.bg/3LHi2rR>, among others. And shares of Intel 
plunged premarket <https://bloom.bg/45uba7L> after CEO Lip-Bu Tan made a 
lackluster forecast and warned of manufacturing problems.

 Deep Dive: What Price Overtourism?

From crushes of visitors inside Dubrovnik’s medieval walls to photo-snapping 
swarms around theMona Lisa, the world is drowning in tourists 
<https://bloom.bg/4kf3KM1>. Protests have followed, including in Barcelona, 
where residentssprayed visitors with water guns <https://bloom.bg/4aaSnRx>. How 
can communities benefit from mass tourism instead of feeling degraded by it?

 * Some destinations are experimenting with higher prices for tourists or 
quotas to thin the crowds. But that can be counterproductive. 
 * “Dispersion” is another approach, pushing visitors away from hotspots. The 
Faroe Islands worked with residents to highlight lesser-known local sites on 
rental car sat navs, while Venice has used cameras and sensors to signal when 
certain areas are saturated. 
 * Accommodation remains one of the most contentious issues. Airbnb says it 
can draw people outside of major hotel districts, but the rise of buy-to-Airbnb 
has squeezed housing supply <https://bloom.bg/45qCiEP>. It’s a balancing act 
cities like New York are still grappling with as they tighten accommodation 
rules <https://bloom.bg/49CqTEh> ahead of the World Cup.  
<https://bloom.bg/4kf3KM1> 

 The Big Take

Iraq closer to the US, its wealthy Sunni-led Gulf Arab allies and Turkey.

Sudani’s choice. As Iraq recovers from the disastrous US invasion, it’s being 
pulled between <https://bloom.bg/49WiCtL> its neighbor Iran, which has built 
decades of influence, and a president who wants America to have more sway in 
OPEC’s second-largest producer.

 Opinion 

 <https://bloom.bg/4pV0jLC> Photographer: Chip Somodevilla 
CEOs would do well to push back when Trump disrupts or threatens corporate 
operations with unhinged policies and proclamations—or lawsuits—rooted in 
personal grievances, bravado or political expediency, Timothy O’ Brien writes. 
They shouldtake a cue <https://bloom.bg/4pV0jLC> from Jamie Dimon, who now has 
a $5 billion reason to stand up to him.
