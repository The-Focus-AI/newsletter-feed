The backlash intensified after the fatal shooting of US citizen Alex Pretti in 
Minnesota. Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal that authorities are 
“reviewing everything” about the killing as Congressional Republicans showed 
signs of wavering on his immigration crackdown <https://bloom.bg/45uL3h9>. 
Democrats vowed to block a spending package <https://bloom.bg/4afk7oc> unless 
Republicans strip funding for Homeland Security, raising the risk for a partial 
shutdown. More than 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies called for a 
de-escalation of tensions <https://bloom.bg/3YZM1hB>. 

Travelers braced for extended disruptions in the US as airlines struggle to 
get their schedules back on track <https://bloom.bg/4t0vHLe> following an 
intense winter storm that saw the most flight cancellations since Covid. The 
Monday morning commute looks messy for New Yorkers <https://bloom.bg/45pXV8g>, 
with modified transport schedules in effect. US power grids stillface 
unprecedented demand <https://bloom.bg/3M71V6W> due to the brutal cold: More 
than 800,000 homes and businesses remain without power.

Relations between the US and Canada were almost as chilly. Trump threatened 
100% tariffs <https://bloom.bg/4sVrgl7> against all Canadian exports to America 
if it makes a trade deal with China, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 
suggesting on ABC that Prime MinisterMark Carney had done an “about-face.” 
<https://bloom.bg/4q4UB9X> But Canada’s foreign minister pushed back 
<https://bloom.bg/4t1d6P9>, telling the CBC that the country will continue to 
diversify its trade away from the US.
 <https://bloom.bg/4t1d6P9> 
The dollar slumped against most of its major peers on speculation that the US 
may help <https://bloom.bg/3YZKdFm> Japan support the yen 
<https://bloom.bg/4aegizB>. This kind of co-ordinated intervention is rare: The 
US has only done so on three separate occasions since 1996, most recently 
selling the yen to help stabilize trading after the 2011 earthquake in Japan. 
The latest prospect is just the latest in a series of blows to acurrency 
already under pressure <https://bloom.bg/3LKlySh> on multiple fronts.

Gold prices stormed beyond $5,000 per ounce for the first time, extending a 
breakneck rally <https://bloom.bg/4sVsEEh> fueled by Trump’s reshaping of 
international relations and investor flight from sovereign bonds and 
currencies. Silver also spiked to a record, above $110. US stock futures looked 
steadier as traders prepared for amassive week of corporate earnings 
<https://bloom.bg/45pXRW4>.

 Deep Dive: Meet your robot interviewer

Next time you apply for a job, your initial interview and training sessions 
might be with a talking bot <https://bloom.bg/45uv8zg>.

 * That’s the vision of Synthesia, anyway. The AI startup lets clients turn 
written scripts into presentations that feature realistic-looking digital humans
 <https://bloom.bg/4sXf5UC>. 
 * Now it plans to offer interactive audio-visual “agents”–avatars that can 
have conversations with users, starting with sales training before expanding to 
recruitment. Watch their CEO explain the strategy on Bloomberg TV 
<https://bloom.bg/4616dn6>. 
 * Being hired by a robot probably beats being replaced by one though. 
Research by Morgan Stanley showed the UK, Japan, Germany and Australia are 
already losing more jobs than they’re creating <https://bloom.bg/4sZvaZX> 
because of AI—a trend not yet seen in the US.

Japan is hurtling toward a snap election called by Prime Minister Sanae 
Takaichi, raising the prospect ofmore unpredictable and violent price swings 
<https://bloom.bg/4t04Cb9> in not only Japan’s bond market, but those around 
the world.
