On Wednesday Wall Street gave Microsoft a rap on the knuckles over its surging 
AI spending and slowing cloud sales growth. On Thursday, investor attention 
returned to the software giant—and this time they punched it in the face.

Microsoft saw its stock fall by 10% by the end of trading, doubling 
yesterday’s losses andjettisoning $357 billion in market value in the process 
<https://bloom.bg/3ZbQC0i>. It was a larger move than the market caps of about 
96% of S&P 500 Index members, and bigger than the values of stock markets in 
countries such as Finland, Vietnam and Poland.

The destruction immediately evoked memories DeepSeek and Nvidia’s resulting 
$593 billion rout <https://bloom.bg/3LH0Lz5> last year. The chill was felt 
elsewhere as well, with peers including Alphabet and the aforementioned Nvidia 
each shedding more than $100 billion at one point during trading.

“Since it is becoming even more evident that Microsoft is not going to garner 
a strong ROI from their massive AI investment,” said Matthew Maley of Miller 
Tabak, “their shares need to be revalued back down to a level that is more 
consistent with its historic fair value.” Here’s yourmarkets wrap

 What You Need to Know Today 

Elon Musk is looking to reorganize his empire. His SpaceX rocket company is 
considering a potential merger with Tesla <https://bloom.bg/3NUMeAk> (of which 
he is chief executive <https://bloom.bg/4rowbcx>) as well as an alternative 
combination with his artificial intelligence firm xAI. Separately, investors 
are also exploring a union of SpaceX and xAI ahead of an initial public 
offering.

Different parts of Musk’s grand vision for SpaceX—putting data centers in 
space for example—would potentially be served by the various scenarios. xAI 
could benefit enormously from computing capacity provided by SpaceX’s data 
centers in orbit (if the company can make the engineering work). Tesla’s 
ability to manufacture energy storage systems could help SpaceX use solar 
energy in space to run the data centers. Musk has also discussed using SpaceX’s 
Starship rockets to carry Tesla’s Optimus robots to the moon as well as to Mars.

Who could forget those heady days when Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya 
Nadella looked like the smartest man in tech? When ChatGPT emerged in late 
2022, his decision to back OpenAI put Nadella’s company at the forefront of the 
AI boom, Dave Lee writes inBloomberg Opinion. 

But more recently, the relationship has cooled, and with it the perceived 
value of Nadella’s foresight. Microsoft has now invested in Anthropic and 
looked to incorporate its capabilities into its products. And OpenAI, hungry 
for computing power, has turned to Oracle, Google and Amazon. All this AI 
polyamory has put Microsoft’s eggs in a few more baskets, Lee writes, but it 
has also highlighted thatMicrosoft’s early mover advantage has run its course

When Tulsi Gabbard was nominated by Donald Trump to be the most powerful 
intelligence official in the US, Democrats howled at how a politician who 
sympathized with Russia’s war on Ukraine andsometimes parroted Kremlin talking 
points <https://bloom.bg/4blHnSy> could be trusted with America’s secrets. 
After being confirmed as national intelligence director by the 
Republican-controlled Senate, Gabbardrailed against the conclusion 
<https://bloom.bg/4khYB5F> of US intelligence officials and other nations that 
Vladimir Putin sought to manipulate US public opinion in favor of Trump during 
the 2016 election. (Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe also concluded 
Russia took actions that helped Trump.)

So when Gabbard was spotted at yesterday’s government raid on the Fulton 
County election office in Georgia, Democrats howled again. The administration 
contends the unprecedented effort by the FBI to scoop up voter records in the 
state is meant to investigate the 2020 election—about which Trump has 
repeatedly made false claims of widespread fraud. The presidentfamously asked 
Georgia officials to find more votes for him <https://bloom.bg/4k6OeBz> after 
he lost the state, and was eventually indicted for it.

A growing chorus of critics allege this week’s raid could be the latest step 
in a White House effort totilt the coming midterm elections in the Republican 
Party’s favor <https://bloom.bg/4bnRFSd>. Virginia Senator Mark Warner said 
there could only be two reasons why Gabbard would take part. The first would be 
if there were a foreign intelligence element, which she would be obligated to 
report to Congress. The second would be she was “injecting the nonpartisan 
intelligence community she is supposed to be leading into a domestic political 
stunt designed to legitimize conspiracy theories thatundermine our democracy 
<https://bloom.bg/4bswBtJ>.”

The shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by US immigration agents 
almost caused a government shutdown this weekend, but a deal struck late 
Thursday delayed any potential confrontation.Senate Democrats reached a 
tentative accord with Trump <https://bloom.bg/4a2L2Cf> that would fund the 
Homeland Security department for two weeks to allow time to continue 
negotiations. Democrats are demanding that federal paramilitaries in 
Minneapolis and other citiesremove their masks and obtain warrants for arrests 
<https://bloom.bg/3Ocmv6t>. 

In Minneapolis Thursday, Trump border czar Tom Homan used the term “drawdown 
<https://bloom.bg/49PLmFS>” to refer to the possible exit of some federal 
agents from Minnesota. It’s a word often used in reference to the removal of 
military troops from foreign territory. ANew York Times article described the 
specializedmilitary weapons and gear <https://bloom.bg/49PLmWo> being used by 
civilian agencies such as ICE and the Border Patrol as they go door-to-door in 
suburban neighborhoods in search of undocumented immigrants.

Why Is Germany Sitting on $599 Billion of Gold?  <https://bloom.bg/3NKgLRu> 
Eighty feet below the streets of Manhattan there’s a New York Fed vault 
containing hundreds of billions of dollars in German gold. Maybe it’s time some 
of it was sold, Chris Bryant writes.

Blackstone is in advanced talks to become the single largest shareholder of 
New World Development <https://bloom.bg/4a1Vk5J>, a move that would see one of 
Hong Kong’s richest families <https://bloom.bg/4c02bzc> relinquish control of a 
major asset. Under the proposed deal, the US company would be able to 
restructure the embattled developer and New World could continue to try to 
offload assets to shore up liquidity.

Founded in 1970 by Cheng Yu-Tung, a former gold shop apprentice from mainland 
China’s Guangdong province, New World is one of Hong Kong’s “Big Four” property 
developers. The family-owned company has built scores of apartment blocks 
throughout the city and owns iconic assets including the sprawling commercial 
complex Victoria Dockside along Hong Kong’s famous harbor.
