Some Wall Street investors and strategists see Donald Trump’s pick of Kevin 
Warsh to lead the Federal Reserveas an odd choice <https://bloom.bg/45G1ibe>. 
If confirmed by the Senate, Warsh—despite a track record of supporting higher 
interest rates because of fears of inflation—will need to navigate a president 
who has insulted and attempted to fire central bank members in a bid to lower 
rates and boost a wavering economy.

Having won Trump’s very public beauty contest with a promise of “regime change 
<https://bloom.bg/4t5erVr>” at the central bank, Warsh, 55, has pledged to 
shrink the Fed’s balance sheet and argued that a productivity boom driven by 
artificial intelligence will keep inflation low. Some see his arrivalas a salve 
<https://bloom.bg/3Mi0W3X> for the “Sell America” craze.

“Warsh is a data-dependent, Fed-credibility choice, so Fed watchers can 
breathe a bit of a sigh of relief,” said David Robin, an interest-rate 
strategist at TJM Institutional Services. “Conversely I’m hard-pressed to think 
Trump would appoint anyone that didn’t commit to lower rates over time starting 
in June. But I think any definitive longer-term market reaction needs time and 
data.” Here’s yourmarkets wrap <https://bloom.bg/4qbPZz0>. —David E. Rovella

 What You Need to Know Today 

Trump turned the search for a new Fed chair into a game show, Jonathan Levin 
writes inBloomberg Opinion. The winner is the most curious possible pick 
<https://bloom.bg/3LXvZ54>. Choosing Warsh is bound to add to market volatility 
and satisfy no one—probably not even the president.

The choice will be a source of tremendous cognitive dissonance across Wall 
Street and policy circles. While Trump pledged to pick a Fed chair who would 
usher in easier monetary policy, Warsh has been regarded as a hawk since his 
five-year stint as a Fed governor ended in 2011. That profile, Levin writes, 
will make it hard for Warsh to build credibility.

The drama was triggered by a dollar rebound on Warsh’s pick for Fed chair. The 
greenback’s rally in turn undercut sentiment among investors who had been 
piling into metals.

Earnings reports from some of the largest US manufacturers and transportation 
companies this week drove home how Trump’s policies on trade and energy are
putting a squeeze on the sector’s profits <https://bloom.bg/4trHItF>.

Caterpillar, which imports raw materials and parts for construction equipment, 
said it expects the Republican’s levies to cost about $2.6 billion this year. 
Railroad Norfolk Southern said trade policy is eroding demand for some of its 
business lines, and shipping giant United Parcel Service said trade flows are 
shifting in a way that’s pressuring margins.

Meanwhile, on the energy front, power-equipment company GE Vernova took a hit 
last month after the Trump administrationrequired work to stop on a wind farm 
<https://bloom.bg/3NMVhDr> off the coast of Massachusetts. Its wind business 
recorded a wider-than-forecast $225 million loss last quarter.

On a day when demonstrators across the US attacked Donald Trump 
<https://bloom.bg/4qXSy96> and his deportation campaign in a national day of 
protest, ICE raids have continued unabated inMinneapolis 
<https://bloom.bg/4t3Uq1f> and Maine, where agents allegedly shattered glass 
over a 1-month-old baby <https://bloom.bg/3LGM2nO>. At the same time, the White 
House was engaged in some very mixed messaging.

Paul, Minnesota, on Friday.Photographer: Bridget Bennett/Bloomberg 
Trump resumed his public attacks on Alex Pretti <https://bloom.bg/45HyS0u>, 
using words like “agitator” and “insurrectionist” to describe the 37-year-old 
ICU nurse who masked Border Patrol agents shot 10 times in the back. Trump 
echoed previous attacks by aides like Stephen Miller, who called Pretti an “
assassin <https://bloom.bg/3NKh66C>,” and Department of Homeland Security 
Secretary Kristi Noem, who made false statements about him shortly after his 
killing.

Trump’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, meanwhile ordered the arrest of 
journalists <https://bloom.bg/4t8aOh9> who covered a protest at a church whose 
pastor works for ICE, raising grave First Amendment issues. But also today, the 
administration said it wasreversing a decision <https://bloom.bg/4q5rcwt> not 
to order a civil rights probe into Pretti’s killing. The White House has 
refused to open a civil rights probe into ICE agent Jonathan Ross’s killing of 
37-year-old Renee Good, insteadchoosing to investigate the dead victim’s partner

The Justice Department’s civil rights division, however, has been gutted, 
former employees have said <https://bloom.bg/4qO7VR3>, with a majority quitting 
over the past year as its new leadership ordersprobes of diversity initiatives 
and alleged voter fraud <https://bloom.bg/49ONpKe>.

Voter fraud, as it turns out, was ostensibly the focus of this week’s FBI 
election records raid on Democratic-leaning Fulton County, which includes 
Atlanta. State election officials meeting in Washington yesterday warned that 
the White House through the FBI may intend tocorrode public confidence in 
upcoming midterm elections <https://bloom.bg/4taRuA1>. Fulton County Chairman 
Robb Pitts said on National Public Radio that he believes the FBI raid is part 
of abroader Trump plan aimed at both the 2026 and 2028 elections 
<https://bloom.bg/45G1irK>.

After flouting a Congressional deadline, the Trump administration released 
some more of the Jeffrey Epstein files today. The late sex offender it seems 
considered buying a private jet from Apollo Global Management co-founder Marc 
Rowan a decade ago, according to emails released Friday by the US Department of 
Justice.

“Jeffrey is asking if he could get the details of Marc’s plane for sale ... 
the hours, photos, any pertinent information!” a representative for Epsteinsaid 
in a Jan. 12, 2016, email to Rowan’s executive assistant 
<https://bloom.bg/4bu4Ukq>. “Possible?”

Bloomberg had previously reported that Rowan, who succeeded Leon Black as CEO, 
attended a meeting at Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse roughly a decade ago. The 
latest cache of files shows Rowan arranged to meet with Epstein multiple times 
over the years, including at least two gatherings in 2016.

With Prime Minister Mark Carney preparing to visit India in the coming weeks, 
Canada’s energy minister sees potential forboosting his country’s liquefied 
natural gas exports there <https://bloom.bg/4tavg0Y>.

“India has huge demand for new LNG,” Tim Hodgson said Friday, shortly after 
returning from his own trip to what he described as “one of the most important 
energy markets in the world.”

Canada is looking at new terminals along its Pacific coast that could bring 
export capacity to 50 million metric tons of LNG annually by the end of the 
decade. That’s up from about 14 million metric tons today through the LNG 
Canada terminal in Kitimat, British Columbia, which opened last year.

Colombia surprised all analysts by raising borrowing costs more than expected 
as arecord minimum wage increase stokes inflation pressure 
<https://bloom.bg/4tflH14>. The central bank lifted its benchmark rate by one 
full percentage point, to 10.25%, governor Leonardo Villar said after the 
meeting. That was higher than expected by all 31 economists surveyed by 
Bloomberg.

The move was the first rate increase since 2023, and traders in interest-rate 
swaps expect the move to be the start of anew monetary tightening phase 
<https://bloom.bg/4tflDhQ>. “Inflation expectations in January increased 
sharply,” the bank said in its statement. “Economic activity indicators for the 
fourth quarter of 2025 suggest that GDP maintained a good dynamism.”
