Good morning. Amazon is shedding a lot more jobs as Wall Street braces for 
Mag7 earnings. On the Fed front, all eyes are on Jerome Powell. And we’ll tell 
you what men’s birth control may soon look like.Listen to the day’s top stories

 Market data may be delayed depending on provider agreements. 

Time to start packing. Amazon announced plans to terminate about 16,000 
workers, ratcheting up efforts tostreamline bureaucracy 
<https://bloom.bg/4aiMXE9> amid rising AI competition. This follows a big round 
of cuts in October that removed14,000 corporate roles <https://bloom.bg/46iVhRT>
 and gutted thevideo games division <https://bloom.bg/4ak0paP>. Yesterday, the 
company said it’s also shuttering itsAmazon-branded grocery stores 
<https://bloom.bg/3Z4p1Ox> and automated grab-and-go markets. 

The belt-tightening comes as investors turn their focus to Magnificent Seven 
earnings kicking off after the close today. Tech got an early lift from ASML’s
AI-fueled order surge <https://bloom.bg/4sVMHSS> (which didn’t keep the Dutch 
company fromcutting 1,700 jobs <https://bloom.bg/45W153V>). Tesla investors 
will watch for updates on self-driving tech and robotics tojustify a soaring 
stock <https://bloom.bg/3LQoP2v>. Meta may land at the high end of guidance, 
while Microsoft is expected to post a 15% sales gain. Beneath the optimism, AI 
isunder pressure to prove <https://bloom.bg/3NQ0lqz> its capital splurge is 
paying off.

Top dollar? The greenback steadied <https://bloom.bg/4q2z41C> after its worst 
stretch <https://bloom.bg/4t288lc> since 2022. Donald Trump said he’s not 
concerned <https://bloom.bg/4qMToW0>—but his relaxed tone is fueling 
speculation that the greenback is at the start of alonger-term decline 
<https://bloom.bg/45zHLcv>, helping gold climb to yet another record 
<https://bloom.bg/3Z1eL9V>. 

No policy change is expected from the Federal Reserve today, but Jerome 
Powell’spress conference <https://bloom.bg/3M6Jq2B> still offers plenty of 
scope for drama. It will be his first since the central bank was served grand 
jury subpoenas—with Powell set to face questions aboutpolitical pressure 
<https://bloom.bg/46koNGW>, Fed independence, and his own future 
<https://bloom.bg/3ZC9zcF>. Traders are increasing bets on a dovish policy shift
 <https://bloom.bg/45xkkk6> as the odds of BlackRock’s Rick Rieder becoming the 
next Fed chair climb.

Representative Ilhan Omar was attacked at a Minneapolis town hall when a man 
charged at her <https://bloom.bg/49NEWa8> with an unknown liquid. She is 
unharmed, and the man is in custody. While Trump has said he’s looking to 
“de-escalate” in Minnesota with areshuffle of the leadership 
<https://bloom.bg/49K4Njh> on his deportation effort, the blame game 
<https://bloom.bg/3LYWEhR> in his inner circle is in full swing. Talks among 
lawmakers are ongoing, as Democratsthreaten a partial shutdown 
<https://bloom.bg/49JXYya>. Apple Chief Tim Cook became the latest executive to 
weigh in <https://bloom.bg/45BeG0g>, telling employees he is “heartbroken” by 
the events.

 Deep Dive: Tether’s Gold Hoard

Switzerland.

Most of Switzerland’s 370,000 Cold War–era bunkers are dormant—but not the one 
owned by crypto giant Tether. More than a ton of gold is hauled into its vault 
each week as the company becomesone of the biggest players 
<https://bloom.bg/4q6G0uO> in the global bullion market.

 * Tether reported buying more gold than any central bank except Poland’s last 
year, whileinvesting in gold-mining <https://bloom.bg/4q6G0Lk> and  hiring 
senior traders <https://bloom.bg/4rgqxJn> to take on the market. 
 * Like a central bank, the firm prizes gold for how easily it can be turned 
into cash and for its reserve asset status <https://bloom.bg/4ajQcv2>. 
 * But the strategy carries risk: S&P Global Ratings has cut Tether’s dollar 
stablecoin to its lowest rating, warning about rising exposure 
<https://bloom.bg/4qHrdHP> to “high-risk” assets like gold.

 The Big Take

Baby food is getting smarter—but harder to keep safe. While infant formula is 
often described as one of the most tightly regulated foods in the world, a 
widening recall shows how growing nutritional complexityis straining the systems
 <https://bloom.bg/3NVGypL> meant to protect the most vulnerable.

options still largely limited to condoms and vasectomies, there’s asizable 
market for alternatives <https://bloom.bg/4t50Nl1>. The bigger question is 
whether men will actually use them.
