getting out and getting organized.Listen to the day’s top stories

Metals continued their breakneck rally, with gold topping $5,500 an ounce, as 
investors continued a retreat from the dollar and Treasuries—the so-called 
debasement trade <https://bloom.bg/4pZHPtb>. The  greenback’s brief bounce 
stalled <https://bloom.bg/3NLTDSD>. Nasdaq futures climbed as investors  sized 
up AI winners and losers <https://bloom.bg/46jWxEi> amid surging Big Tech 
spending. Attention is turning to Apple, which reports after the close, as 
investors try to assess how much rapidly rising memory prices are eating into 
its bottom line <https://bloom.bg/3Z2lEYx>.
 <https://bloom.bg/3Z2lEYx> 
Despite all the fears about AI’s cash burn, there appears to be no letup in 
the rush to throw money at it. Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon are looking at
stumping up as much as $60 billion <https://bloom.bg/46eWCZV> for a new funding 
round for OpenAI, according to The Information. SoftBank is also planning to
chip in <https://bloom.bg/4q78qVl>. Meanwhile, Nvidia is still waiting 
<https://bloom.bg/4bqrASy> for the Chinese government to approve imports of its 
H200 devices.

Tesla is plotting a $20 billion spending spree to build Elon Musk’s AI future 
<https://bloom.bg/4rk1e9i>, halting production of its S and X models to shift 
factory capacity toward Optimus humanoid robots. That’s twice as much as Wall 
Street was expecting. Musk said the company needs tobuild and operate its own 
“TeraFab.” <https://bloom.bg/3ZET53u> And remember Robinhood, the upstart 
broker credited with getting young people hooked on trading? Well, it’s said to 
bevying for a key role <https://bloom.bg/4qa9WWB> in the blockbuster IPO 
planned for Musk’s rocket and satellite company SpaceX.

Talks between top Senate Democrats and the Trump administration aimed at 
averting a government shutdown havemoved closer to Democrats’ demands 
<https://bloom.bg/3NTuMMA>, a person familiar said. They’re insisting on new 
constraints on the president’s immigration crackdown <https://bloom.bg/3Z6p9NC>
. Shutdowns have become a recurring feature of US politics,here’s why 
<https://bloom.bg/4riqKvD>. Meanwhile, the price of health care tops a long 
list of voters’ economic worries <https://bloom.bg/4royAnJ> ahead of November’s 
midterms. And Donald Trump’s aides and allies are struggling to get him tostick 
to the script <https://bloom.bg/4rnbXjn>.

 Deep Dive: Building a Better California

Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt are among the billionaires  bankrolling a new 
pro-business political organization <https://bloom.bg/4a3OInt> in California 
that plans to promote middle-class homeownership and fight a ballot measure 
aimed at institutinga one-time 5% wealth tax <https://bloom.bg/4riqHzX> in the 
state.

 * The idea has already prompted an exodus of billionaires from the Golden 
State before November’s ballot. Google co-founder Brin, who appears to have
moved to Nevada <https://bloom.bg/4rkOJu3>, has donated $20 million to the 
cause, more than half of the $35 million raised by the group so far. 
 * DoorDash co-founder Tony Xu has also chipped in, as have crypto billionaire 
Chris Larsen and venture capitalist Mike Moritz. Leading the campaign is 
veteran ballot initiative consultant Ned Wigglesworth. 
 * At least six billionaires left California before the new year, with Larry 
Page, another Google co-founder,reportedly relocating to Florida 
<https://bloom.bg/4bq6zHv>. 
 * The wealth-tax initiative, which would apply to residents with more than $1 
billion in net worth (of whom there are about 200), faces steep hurdles and is 
expected to meet fierce opposition, including from Democratic Governor Gavin 
Newsom.

While Iran's economy crumbles and hardship sparked the deadliest protests in 
decades, Mojtaba Khamenei—son of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei—quietly built a global 
investment empire <https://bloom.bg/4a1T8eB>. A year-long investigation exposes 
how the financial reach of the Supreme Leader’s family goes far beyond the 
Islamic Republic’s borders.

An independent Palestine cannot resemble Hamas’s rule in Gaza if Palestinians 
are to have any hope of peace and prosperity, writes Marc Champion. But Israel, 
too, will remain trapped in violence as long as Benjamin Netanyahu pursues 
policies of repression and provocation. On both sides, the old guardneeds to go
