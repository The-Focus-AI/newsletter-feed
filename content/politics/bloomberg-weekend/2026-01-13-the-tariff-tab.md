New data from the Trump administration Tuesday indicated underlying US 
inflation roseless than expected <https://bloom.bg/4pBhTE8> in December. The 
core consumer price index, which excludes the often volatile food and energy 
categories, increased 0.2% from November, according to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, part of the US Department of Labor. On an annual basis, it advanced 
2.6%, matching a four-year low.

While the impact of last year’s government shutdown on the data hasn’t fully 
unwound, “the key positive in this report is flat core goods prices, 
reinforcing the view that tariff pass‑through to consumers has been much milder 
than anticipated,” Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, 
said in a note.
 <https://bloom.bg/4pBhTE8> 
Federal Reserve officials are widely expected to hold interest rates steady 
later this month after three straight cuts to close out 2025. Officialsare 
divided <https://bloom.bg/4pF7IhV>, balancing concerns about still-high 
inflation with risingunemployment <https://bloom.bg/4sDuEkl>. Some investors 
say no cuts willcome this year at all <https://bloom.bg/4sFpDYu>.

Donald Trump, who previously called the US affordability crisis 
<https://bloom.bg/4pBaTXG> a “hoax <https://bloom.bg/4p8OFfu>,” today called it 
“fake <https://bloom.bg/4jYg1UZ>.” But the president has spent much of the past 
year pressuring the central bank and its leader, Jerome Powell, to reduce rates 
in a bid to boost the economy—often insulting the Fed chair in the process (as 
he did today <https://bloom.bg/49PcV1T>). Trump’s administration this week 
launched a criminal investigation of Powell tied to his testimony over a
renovation project <https://bloom.bg/3LhkaX7>. It’s a move seen by critics as 
weaponizing the criminal justice system <https://bloom.bg/4jBQVL8> to force 
Powell’s hand.—Jordan Parker Erb <https://bloom.bg/4h9Fgkw> and David E. Rovella

 What You Need to Know Today 

JPMorgan’s investment-banking fees unexpectedly fell in the fourth quarter, 
missing the firm’s own guidance from just last month as revenue from both 
underwriting and advising on mergers declined.

three months of 2025,down 5% from a year earlier <https://bloom.bg/3NhpGtn>. 
The firm said in December that it expected a percentage gain in the “low single 
digits.” Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said the shortfall can be 
partially attributed to deals that had been expected to be completed in the 
fourth quarter but got pushed into this year. Marketsreacted poorly

The hedge fund industry posted its best returns since 2009 last year, with 
gains of about 12.6% <https://bloom.bg/3NhKGAe>. Funds run by industry giants 
such as D.E. Shaw & Co. and Millennium Management posted double-digit returns, 
with Bridgewater Associates’ Pure Alpha II fund scoring a 34% gain.

The banner year was made possible by global volatility across the board, from 
markets that swung with artificial intelligence buzz (or bubbles), geopolitical 
shocks and interest rate uncertainty, all of which combined to create rich 
trading opportunities for strategies designed to thrive amid the chaos.

Tankers hauling Russia’s crude are piling up at sea with nowhere to go as the 
Kremlin struggles to revive the Indian market <https://bloom.bg/4sFMJOu> that 
saved its oil trade from war-related sanctions.

At least 12 vessels full of Urals crude are anchored off the southern coast of 
Oman, with some having been there since mid-December and more arriving almost 
every day. The value of Moscow’s exports fell to $950 million a week in the 28 
days to Jan. 11, sliding by 2% from the revised figure for the period to Jan. 
4, with average prices falling for a 15th straight week.

In case the White House missed the memo, Greenland’s prime minister 
categorically ruled out joining the US and said the Arctic territoryprefers to 
be in a union with Denmark <https://bloom.bg/3Z8Xz23>, pushing back on threats 
of US expansion in the aftermath of its surprise attack on Venezuela.

Greenland also said it will intensify efforts to ensure the island’s defenses 
are managedwithin the NATO military alliance <https://bloom.bg/4pOp3oQ>, which 
includes both Denmark and the US. The statements came after members of German 
Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s cabinet traveled to Washington to understand 
Trump’s motives for making veiled threats against the NATO ally, a meeting 
officials saiddid not provide insight <https://bloom.bg/4sFIIcU>.
