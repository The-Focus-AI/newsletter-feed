US consumer confidence plummeted in January to the lowest level in 12 years 
<https://bloom.bg/4k9yeyY> on more pessimistic views from Americans worried 
about the nation’s economy, inflation and a weakening labor market.

The gauge by the Conference Board decreased to 84.5, from an upwardly revised 
94.2 last month, data out Tuesday showed. The figure was the lowest since May 
2014 and fell short of all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
 <https://bloom.bg/4k9yeyY> 
After a slight improvement in December, American consumer confidence resumed 
its downward slide. Economists project thelabor market will largely remain 
stagnant <https://bloom.bg/3O7YOfz> this year, with limited job opportunities.

In write-in responses to the survey, consumers often mentioned prices of oil, 
gas and groceries, said Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board. 
Mentions of politics, the labor market and health insurance also rose.

The share of consumers that said jobs were currently hard to get was the 
highest since February 2021, while the portion saying jobs were plentiful 
deteriorated. Fewer Americans expect their incomes to rise in the coming 
months, prompting consumers to cut back on vacation plans and approach 
big-ticket purchases like new cars more cautiously.—Jordan Parker Erb 
<https://bloom.bg/4h9Fgkw> and David E. Rovella <https://bloom.bg/42IzHFH>

 What You Need to Know Today 

The day after Donald Trump appeared to retreat due to the national fury over 
federal agents killing two American citizens in Minneapolis, the Republican was 
again blaming a victim, criticizing Alex Pretti’s possession of a licensed 
firearmshortly before he was shot dead <https://bloom.bg/3LObfN3>. And just as 
Trump refused to order a civil rights probe of ICE’s killing of Renee Good two 
weeks earlier, areport from MS NOW says <https://bloom.bg/4qNmGns> there will 
be no civil rights probe of the killing of Pretti, either.

Democratic members of Congress on Tuesday threatened to impeach Department of 
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unless she wasfired 
<https://bloom.bg/4t15MD8>. Trump says he is standing by the former South 
Dakota governor <https://bloom.bg/4sZjI0J>, who had no traditional experience 
associated with the role <https://bloom.bg/49KLart> when nominated. A study by 
theWashington Post showed that Noem’s agency has repeatedly rushed to defend 
agents who shot civilians at least16 times <https://bloom.bg/4k66YB9> before 
any investigation was completed. The study also showed Noem and other Trump 
aides moving quickly to vilify and even criminally charge victims.

Since Pretti’s killing, US Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly sought what 
Minnesota officials say was a quid pro quo 
<https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/politics/minnesota-trump-voter-rolls.html?smid=nytcore-android-share >
 for de-escalation and cooperation: election data Democrats contend Trump plans 
to use to throw doubt on the upcoming midterms in which Republicans are 
currently at a disadvantage.

Minnesota officials have demanded the administration cooperate with state and 
local investigators in the probe of the two killings, but the White House has 
refused, leading Democrats to warn the administration is unlikely to conduct a 
fair and impartial investigation. Nevertheless, state officials continue to 
accumulate evidence, in part because there isno statute of limitations on murder

The Rule of Law May Be Already Gone  <https://bloom.bg/3Mb4Z1U> 
If ICE agents can shoot civilians at point-blank range and never be held 
accountable, Noah Feldman writes, then we aren’t living under the rule of law. 
We’re living in a police state.

Dollar traders are paying the most on record to bet on a deeper selloff in the 
greenback <https://bloom.bg/49TwGWl> as an increasingly destabilized US 
triggers a rush into bearish hedges. The premium for short-dated options that 
profit from a weaker US currency has widened to the highest level since 
Bloomberg began compiling the data in 2011. The bearish sentiment isn’t 
confined to the front-end—investors are the most pessimistic on the dollar’s 
long-term outlook since at least May 2025.

But for Trump on Tuesday, down was up. As the president arrived in Iowa to 
tout his recent attempts to address affordability issues, he was asked what he 
thought of the dollar’s plight. He said, “I think it’s great 
<https://bloom.bg/3NGCrhj>.” 
 <https://bloom.bg/49TwGWl> 

UnitedHealth forecast a decline in 2026 revenue, the first annual contraction 
in more than three decades <https://bloom.bg/3NH7BVQ>, as the insurer falters 
in its attempt to rebuild confidence with investors after a stunning fall last 
year. The news was the second blow to shareholders in as many days. Late 
Monday, the Trump administration proposed holdingpayments to private Medicare 
plans <https://bloom.bg/3ZBOrmQ> flat next year, a huge disappointment that 
caused the stock to tumble as much as 10% in after-hours trading.

US airlines are still paring back flights as a deep freeze hampers the restart 
of operations <https://bloom.bg/4t9iQqq> at some major hubs. As of Tuesday 
morning, airlines had canceled more than 1,500 flights. While that’s less than 
Monday’s 6,100 cancellations and Sunday’s 11,600—the most since the early days 
of the Covid-19 pandemic—airlines could face further disruptions asanother 
arctic blast looms later this week <https://bloom.bg/49LK4f3>.

Canada and India will pledge to expand trade in oil and gas as the countries 
reboot their relationship <https://bloom.bg/4q6kXIC>. Ottawa will commit to 
ship more crude oil, liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas to 
India, while New Delhi will send more refined petroleum products to Canada.

The relaunch of dialogue may signal that both governments see untapped 
potential—and strategic value—in tightening an energy relationship that had 
been left to drift. Meanwhile, India’s pullback from Russian oil imports 
<https://bloom.bg/4ajgrBS> is leaving Moscow with the dilemma of  what to do 
with all the crude <https://bloom.bg/4sXZl3L> that it’s pumping onto tankers 
but is unable to offload at refineries.

The renewed push also marks one of Prime Minister Mark Carney’s major efforts 
to diversify Canada’s export markets at a time of escalating hostility and 
economic aggression by Trump. It also reflects his government’s shift toward 
pragmatic, economy-first diplomacy with major Asian partners as it pivots away 
from America.

Yale will offer free tuition to undergraduates from families making less than 
$200,000. Theenhanced financial aid <https://bloom.bg/4qIeZi5> will ensure that 
such students will “receive need-based scholarships that meet or exceed the 
cost of tuition,” Yale said in a statement Tuesday.

The changes, which take effect in the 2026-2027 academic year, will also 
eliminate all expected costs for families with typical assets and incomes below 
$100,000. The decision matches amove by Harvard University last year 
<https://bloom.bg/4bSXiI7> to broaden educational affordability.
