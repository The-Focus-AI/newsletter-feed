Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was served grand 
jury subpoenas <https://bloom.bg/49vieCf> from the Justice Department 
threatening a criminal indictment related to Powell’s testimony onongoing 
renovations <https://bloom.bg/49yD4Ra> of the Fed’s headquarters. He described 
the unprecedented move <https://bloom.bg/3NhJL2C> as a consequence of the Fed 
not lowering interest rates as aggressively as the president wishes.

There was immediate bipartisan pushback, with Senator Thom Tillis, a key 
Republican on the Banking Committee who isn’t running for reelection, vowing to
oppose any Trump nominees <https://bloom.bg/3NhJNrg> to the Fed until the 
matter is resolved. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte was said 
to be theinstigator <https://bloom.bg/4aU6jjV> behind the subpoenas, while 
Donald Trump denied to NBC any knowledge of the DOJ investigation.

Protests in Iran intensified and at least 544 people have died and  more than 
10,000 arrested <https://bloom.bg/3Lak7fJ>. Tehran warned the US and Israel 
against any intervention <https://bloom.bg/3YDWz5U>, while Trump said the US is 
monitoring and “looking at some very strong options.” US commanders have 
briefed the president on options for military strikes <https://bloom.bg/4aVWimm>
, according to an official.

In Europe, a group of countries led by the UK and Germany is discussing plans 
for a military presence in Greenland <https://bloom.bg/4ql3AEW> to both appease 
Trump and show the continent is committed to Arctic security, people familiar 
said. Diplomats from Denmark and Greenlandwill meet <https://bloom.bg/45CrR0M> 
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday, TV2 reported.
 <https://bloom.bg/4ql3AEW> 
Closer to home, thousands marched <https://bloom.bg/49v9Vq6> Saturday in 
Minneapolis to the site where an ICE agent shot and killed Renée Nicole Good 
last week. Smaller groups gathered in other cities. Homeland Security Secretary 
Kristi Noem told Fox that“hundreds more” <https://bloom.bg/49vhYTN> officers 
would be deployed, while the Department of Agriculture secretary said she’d
suspend some federal funding <https://bloom.bg/4aRcdCl>to Minnesota over 
alleged fraud.

 Deep Dive: Big Bank Earnings 

The rally in US bank stocks will face its first test of the year as Wall 
Street’s marquee namesreport results starting Tuesday <https://bloom.bg/4aQwyHS>
, with investors focused on commentary about the health of the American 
consumer and the strength of the economy.

 * Lenders are expected to deliver a  massive earnings haul 
<https://bloom.bg/4aVwFls>, thanks to a surge in corporate dealmaking, strong 
trading revenue and lower costs. 
 * Top of mind will be consumer lending, from provisions for loan losses to 
how Americans are using—and paying off—credit cards. 
 * And still happening: Trump doubled down <https://bloom.bg/4aPlpXP> on a 
demand that credit card issuers lower rates to 10% by Jan. 20 and keep them 
there for a year.  <https://bloom.bg/4aQwyHS> 

 The Big Take 

China overtook the US in investing abroad in the first half of 2025, signaling 
ahistoric shift <https://bloom.bg/4pzMMZK> in global capital flows.

 Opinion 

Prosecuting Powell probably won’t succeed and the political optics are poor, 
John Authers writes. To the extent that it implies an erratic White House will 
be trying ever harder to set monetary policy,logic suggests 
<https://bloom.bg/4aUIUPb> that it may be good for gold and bad for the dollar.

The only sign of Alejandro “Alex” Brito’s most famous client in his corner 
office near Miami is a bobblehead doll depicting Donald Trump as the 
“Terminator.” It’s a fitting memento forthe lawyer <https://bloom.bg/49CK2EX> 
who’s led an extraordinary wave of litigation against media outlets, part of 
the president’s legal strategy in his second term.
