Donald Trump’s point man on border enforcement in Minneapolis, Greg Bovino, is 
set to leave the city <https://bloom.bg/4agz7Cf> after a wave of public outrage 
over shootings by federal agents. The backlash, includingprotests and 
bipartisan criticism <https://bloom.bg/4a2K3Cp>, seems to be forcing Trump to 
recalibrate his approach <https://bloom.bg/4sT6PoG>. The president spent two 
hours in a meeting with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the New York 
Times reported, a sign he’s increasingly concerned about the fallout. Meanwhile,
his administration won an appeals court order <https://bloom.bg/4thIg5c> 
blocking restrictions on ICE tactics for dealing with protesters in the state.

Meanwhile, US stocks—boosted by the tech sector—are set to open higher today 
<https://bloom.bg/49Xi0nL>, following the lead of Asian equities, which hit 
record highs earlier in the day. Gold and silver are also trading near record 
levels, withbullion still having room to run <https://bloom.bg/45AH8PL> as 
investors run down their dollar holdings, according to Vincent Mortier, chief 
investment officer at Amundi, Europe’s largest money manager.

Goldman Sachs’ CEO signaled a slower pace of hiring in 2026, even as he made 
an upbeat call on global markets as deregulation stokes deals. David Solomon 
outlinedkey tailwinds and risks for the US economy <https://bloom.bg/4sWofRj> — 
and what they could mean for monetary policy — in an exclusive interview with 
Bloomberg’s Stephen Engle.Watch the video <https://bloom.bg/4t9CvXd>.

Tariff talk is back. Trump threatened to hike duties on South Korean goods to 
25% <https://bloom.bg/3NEYncE>. Markets, though, were unfazed: South Korean 
stocks largelyshrugged off the threat <https://bloom.bg/49VJGcC>. Maybe because 
Trumprarely follows through  <https://bloom.bg/4afxrJ8>on this sort of 
intimidation, our analysis shows. Meanwhile,India and the EU capped nearly two 
decades of negotiations <https://bloom.bg/4qBGsCa> and signed a trade agreement 
that the European Commission called “the mother of all deals,” as the rest of 
the world presses on.

In corporate and other news: Julia Carreon, a former Citigroup wealth 
management executive, sued the bankalleging that she faced sexual harassment 
<https://bloom.bg/4ag2qEZ> from one of the firm’s top leaders, Andy Sieg. “This 
lawsuit has absolutely no merit and we will demonstrate that through the legal 
process,” a bank spokesperson said.Starbucks’ CEO Brian Niccol’s pay 
<https://bloom.bg/4qCAgtC> fell by more than half in 2025 to $31 million. And 
Nike is said tolay off around 775 workers at distribution centers 
<https://bloom.bg/4qPlIqS> as it integrates AI.

 Deep Dive: Storms & Natural Gas

US natural gas prices fell as traders took profits after prices shot up nearly 
30% on Monday <https://bloom.bg/4afxyV4> because of freezing temperatures that 
enveloped vast swathes of the country and pushed up heating demand.

 * Freezing weather is sweeping across much of the US, putting strain on 
electricity grids and driving up demand <https://bloom.bg/4aed3YW> for the 
heating and power-plant fuel. 
 * The storm knocked out about 12% of the country’s natural gas production, 
limiting supplies to the power sector and home furnaces, and putting 67 million 
people from New Jersey to Chicago at risk <https://bloom.bg/4t16j8h>. 
 * Meanwhile, US airlines  canceled almost 1,000 flights today 
<https://bloom.bg/4sXJzpL> and the country’s largest grid operator was  
authorized to divert data center power <https://bloom.bg/4t3qhiw> to households 
and other customers to prevent rolling blackouts. 
 * Watch here how the winter storm is  affecting natural gas supply

 The Big Take 

 <https://bloom.bg/4ahbKbC> 
Many investors copied the Ivy League school’s bets on private equity and other 
illiquid investments <https://bloom.bg/4ahbKbC>. Now plain old stocks and bonds 
are outperforming.
