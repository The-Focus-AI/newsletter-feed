More workers on Wall Street are getting dismissed than at any time in a decade 
it would seem. The biggest US banks have said they’re slashing employees in the 
name of cost-cutting, with the six largest—JPMorgan, Bank of America, 
Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley—retaining 10,600 fewer 
workers in December from a year earlier.

In the aftermath of Covid-19, pink slips came with the explanation that banks 
were correcting for over-hiring that was spurred by a pandemic deal boom. But 
these days, the reason is evolving into howartificial intelligence may be 
replacing more people <https://bloom.bg/4sJae9C>. —David E. Rovella

 What You Need to Know Today 

So while all those careers get short-circuited, the banks themselves are 
firing on all thrusters. Wall Street’s five giants reported a record $134 
billion of trading revenue from last year and an upswing in dealmaking.

The economic and political maelstroms triggered by Donald Trump over the past 
year have been catnip for traders as clients rushed to reposition their 
portfolios. At the same time, the Republican president’s deregulatory agenda 
and Federal Reserve rate cuts combined to revive a moribund environment for 
mergers and acquisitions. The trading surge is in “middle innings,” Morgan 
Stanley Chief Executive Officer Ted Pick told analysts. “We’re in that sweet 
spot right now <https://bloom.bg/4qQw49m>.”
 <https://bloom.bg/4qQw49m> 

Wall Street  <https://bloom.bg/4sJJWE0> 
Goldman Stock Traders Beat Their Own Record  <https://bloom.bg/4sJJWE0> 
They blew through expectations for equities-trading revenue, posting a Wall 
Street record of $4.31 billion in the final three months of 2025.

The latest unemployment data from the Trump administration released Thursday 
stated that applications for US benefits fell last week to the lowest level 
since November.

The figure from the US Department of Labor, as with a series of federal 
reports on jobs, inflation and economic growth over the past few months, was 
out of sync with predictions by economists outside government and came inbelow 
all estimates in a Bloomberg survey <https://bloom.bg/4qW3vaC>.

A University of Michigan survey <https://bloom.bg/3NwpmH8>, meanwhile, showed 
consumers remained downbeat about the labor market in recent weeks, with almost 
two-thirds expecting unemployment to rise in the year ahead.

China and Canada are pushing to expand energy deals. Prime Minister Mark 
Carney’s government is looking to sell more oil and gas to the Asian economic 
power whilecourting investment in battery technology and renewable energy 
<https://bloom.bg/3LJujfj>.

Carney, the latest world leader to drop in on President Xi Jinping, also 
revealed a framework for energy trade while in Beijing this week. The document 
pledged to establish a ministerial dialogue and to exploreopportunities in oil, 
gas, nuclear and clean technology <https://bloom.bg/45XCmfh>.

Canada’s move to deepen energy ties with China and openly court its capital 
represents a sharp break from the diplomatic chill of recent years. Behind it, 
of course, is Trump’s global trade war and in particular his attacks on 
America’s neighbor to the north. Trump’s tariffs have spurred a rush for Canada 
to diversify its export markets, nudging the country closer to its 
second-largest trading partner.
 <https://bloom.bg/45XCmfh> 

Bobby Jain’s hedge fund, the latest entrant in the booming market, made 
hundreds of millions of dollars in profits last year. Butmost of it went to 
paying for the investment firm’s front-loaded expenses 
<https://bloom.bg/3YDGLQG>. Jain Global generated about $750 million in trading 
profits in 2025, but investors are said to have shared only about a quarter of 
the gains after accounting for fees and expenses. That means anet gain of about 
3.7% <https://bloom.bg/4rgDdQL>.

Multistrategy funds are already the most expensive among peers because they 
pass on all costs to investors. That setup is particularly brutal in a launch 
year, where a partially deployed pool of capital carries the full cost base of 
a new operation. But all is not lost: Industry studies show clients keepabout 
40% <https://bloom.bg/4sGWM6b> of profits at established multistrategy funds.

Jain Global is a test case for the pricey hedge fund model and whether 
newcomers can carve out a space for themselves in a world dominated by the 
likes of Citadel and Millennium Management, which took decades to transform 
themselves into investment giantstrading across assets and continents 
<https://bloom.bg/4sJe0jg>.

Trump is talking insurrection again. In a social media post, he threatened to 
invoke the law <https://bloom.bg/49nzgDA>—despite the arguable illegality in 
doing so <https://bloom.bg/49nzgDA>—and send US soldiers to Minnesota to fend 
off demonstrators, some of whom have taken to throwing snowballs and fireworks 
at heavily armed, masked paramilitary forces.

The protests against Trump’s immigration dragnet, turbocharged by the shooting 
death of Renee Good <https://bloom.bg/3YI7jjF> by Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement employee Jonathan Ross, intensified after federal agents shot 
another unarmed person this week, injuring him. The government claimed that 
shooting was justified, but its account of events could not be independently 
verified.

The latest threat by Trump also comes after the Justice Department declined to 
open a civil rights investigation into Good’s killing,despite video analyses 
contradicting <https://bloom.bg/49uEVq6> Trump administration assertions of 
self defense. Several federal prosecutors resigned after the Justice Department
reportedly sought to investigate Good <https://bloom.bg/4qVbKUg>.
