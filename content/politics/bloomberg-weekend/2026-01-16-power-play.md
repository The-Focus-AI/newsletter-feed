Donald Trump is poised to order the largest US grid operator to hold an 
emergency power auction,forcing tech giants to bankroll new generation 
<https://bloom.bg/4r1wiuC> for data centers. PJM, which already hosts the 
world’s biggest cluster of power-hungry facilities in northern Virginia, will 
have little say in the matter. While deemed essential to winning the global AI 
race, data centers are increasingly forcing everyday households to unwittingly
pay for the digital economy <https://bloom.bg/4sHTRKt>.

In markets, a record trade surplus racked up by China—$1.2 trillion no less—is 
washing up around the world <https://bloom.bg/49TPjct>, as export earnings that 
once ended up in state coffers instead fund massive private purchases of 
overseas securities and business expansion abroad. Veteran investor Mark Mobius

Global credit markets,running at their hottest <https://bloom.bg/4qR6ssY> in

Tradeoffs. Canada and China reached a deal to lower trade barriers 
<https://bloom.bg/4qRMLkH>, including a cut in tariffs for Canadian canola and

referencing a “new world order.” US firms havebecome more upbeat 
<https://bloom.bg/3LL5FLg> about doing business in China after a trade truce 
between Trump and Xi. Taiwan sought to downplay concerns its tech industry is
being hollowed out <https://bloom.bg/3NopY1F> by a US trade deal, as chipmakers 
prepare to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in America.

Ford is in talks with China’s BYD to supply batteries for hybrid vehicles 
<https://bloom.bg/3LK9lwR> to its overseas factories, a step that risks

 Deep Dive: Reshaping the Fed 

 <https://bloom.bg/3LG8pJL> Illustration: Adrienne Tong/Bloomberg 
The Federal Reserve is in for an unusual amount of upheaval as the Trump 
administration continues its efforts to reshape the central bank and exert more 
sway over policy. Appointing the next chair is justone piece in the mosaic 
<https://bloom.bg/3LG8pJL>.

 * On the verge of naming a successor to Jerome Powell, the administration  
took one more shot <https://bloom.bg/49YVHPG> at the incumbent—and triggered a 
Washington backlash that could yet derail the campaign to tighten White House 
control over the central bank. 
 * That stoked expectations that Powell will stay on the Board of Governors 
after his term as chair ends in May—setting up the optics of a rival center of 
influence <https://bloom.bg/4qVRaTK> inside the world’s most powerful central 
bank. 
 * National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, a front-runner to become 
the next chair, says he’s up to the job <https://bloom.bg/4sIYsMh>. Meanwhile, 
several policymakers have signaled a willingness to pause 
<https://bloom.bg/49pD1bD> rate cuts at the January meeting. 
 * Another major dilemma for the Fed, or rather “trilemma”:  how big should 
its balance sheet be <https://bloom.bg/4b2rjVz> after it stopped shrinking its 
$6.5 trillion portfolio? 

 The Big Take

Tehran, on Jan. 9.Photographer: MAHSA/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images 
Western sanctions have supercharged Iran’s revolutionary guards into a 
colossal economic and political force. Even if they put down the 
anti-government protests, their influence won’t end there. The corps will be 
central to what comes next, be it a strongman taking over, a coup, or the slow 
death of the Islamic Republic <https://bloom.bg/4qZb8wZ>.

 Opinion 

Donald Trump’s tariffs may not have triggered a recession or a broad inflation 
surge, but they were far from painless <https://bloom.bg/4b1XynZ>, writes 
Jonathan Levin. They hit low-income families and smaller businesses in 
particular, while keeping interest rates higher for longer. The fact that we 
dodged a self-inflicted catastrophe is nothing to celebrate, he says.

Plunging into a cold pool after sweating it out in a sauna may not be 
everyone’s idea of fun. Yet bathhouses are booming—hosting everything from
