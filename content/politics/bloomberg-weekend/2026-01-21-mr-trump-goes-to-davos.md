it’s working to fast-track visas for World Cup ticketholders.Listen to the 
day’s top stories <https://bloom.bg/46f4FXw>.

Donald Trump’s trip to Davos got off to a rough start—literally. The plane he 
was on wasforced to turn around <https://bloom.bg/4pSOUf8> shortly after 
departure because of a mechanical issue and he was forced to board a new plane. 
The president is still set to arrive in Switzerland today, where he’ll meet 
with foreign leaders andgive a speech <https://bloom.bg/4sPoUEd>. 

Already speaking at the World Economic Forum is Treasury Secretary Scott 
Bessent, who blamed Jerome Powell for “politicizing the Fed 
<https://bloom.bg/4bPkIxY>.” Bessent also shrugged off a Danish pension fund 
selling its holding of US Treasuries, saying the position, like the country 
itself, was “irrelevant.” BlackRock CEO and interim co-chief of WEF Larry Fink 
mulled bringing the event to “places like Detroit and Dublin 
<https://bloom.bg/4bPkJ50>.”

The latest wrinkle in Trump’s proposed “Board of Peace for Gaza”? A US 
official said the presidentcould still chair the group 
<https://bloom.bg/4jN70O6> even after he leaves the White House, until he 
chooses to resign. Trump has suggested the board may replace the UN—hislist of 
invitees <https://bloom.bg/3ZmDRjp> is certainly far-ranging—but there’s little 
indication <https://bloom.bg/4a3v6Rr> any charter would be signed in Davos as 
the president wishes.

Closer to home, the DOJ sent subpoenas to top Minnesota officials 
<https://bloom.bg/4sRSwRa> in a widening investigation over whether they 
conspired to impedefederal immigration enforcement <https://bloom.bg/49uo208> 
efforts, a person familiar said. NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani told The View he 
supportsabolishing ICE <https://bloom.bg/4t69JGW>, a view shared by about half 
of Americans, according to a recent Economist/YouGov poll.

Venezuela’s government received its first payment from the $500 million sale 
of its oil <https://bloom.bg/3LRYYXT> by the US, getting about $300 million and 
allowing for the influx of much-needed dollars into the economy for the first 
time in a month. Meanwhile the US captured aseventh sanctioned oil tanker 
<https://bloom.bg/4jU1326> tied to the country.

 Deep Dive: Fracking Goes Global 

 <https://bloom.bg/4pUMixt> Photographer: Ricardo Ceppi/Getty Images South 
America 
Fracking has been honed over the past 15 years in the US. The technique is now 
being deployed tounlock hard-to-reach oil and gas reserves 
<https://bloom.bg/4pUMixt> from Australia to Saudi Arabia.

 * Many of the easiest-to-reach oil and gas deposits have been extracted from 
around the world using conventional drilling. So countries are testing the US 
playbook. 
 * Argentina is a  notable success <https://bloom.bg/4sO4nji>, being the first 
to advance fracking outside of North America in a significant way. 
 * As fracking spreads, so does criticism. The greenhouse gas footprint may be 
as bad or worse than coal, and fracking brings the risks 
<https://bloom.bg/3NEMtiN> of earthquakes and geysers, and can strain water 
resources. 

 The Big Take

Trump’s Greenland threat is stirring  Europe’s deepest divisions 
<https://bloom.bg/4pUMj4v>. Leaders from across the fragmented continent are on 
a desperate mission to salvage what they can from the wreckage of the 
transatlantic alliance—with no clear idea of how to do it.

The US said it’s fast-tracking visas for  World Cup ticket holders 
<https://bloom.bg/4jQYaiB> amid concerns the Trump administration’s clampdown 
will complicate travel. Last week it froze visa processing for 75 countries 
including Brazil, Haiti and Iran, whose national teams have qualified for the 
tournament.
