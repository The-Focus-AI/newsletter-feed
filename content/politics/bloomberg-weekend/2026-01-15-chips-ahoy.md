Good morning. The AI boom lives on. LIV Golf is losing its pricey grudge 
match. And synchrony is all that counts for the century’s greatest timepiece.
Listen to the day’s top stories <https://bloom.bg/46f4FXw>.

Chips ahoy. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is budgeting up to $56 billion 
for capital spending this year, a forecast thatfired up investor hopes 
<https://bloom.bg/3YD5LYn> of a sustained AI boom. Asia’s most valuable company 
also sees revenue growth close to 30%,spurring Nasdaq futures 
<https://bloom.bg/4pK1fCq> to gains. Cartier holiday sales 
<https://bloom.bg/3NLNbuD> gave Richemont a boost in the final months of 2025. 
Goldman is expected to post a surge in investment-banking fees in its earnings 
report; Morgan Stanley is also due today.

Oil fell for the first time in six days after Donald Trump signaled he may 
hold off on attacking Iran <https://bloom.bg/3YGHRuT> for now, having been 
reassured that Tehran would stop killing protestors. He also said it would be 
better for Venezuela tostay in OPEC <https://bloom.bg/3NxrmyV>. Opposition 
leader María Corina Machado is due at the White House today. Few parts of the 
world can boast having had as many women atop governments than Latin America, 
so it’s hardly surprising to see two (rival) womendominating the headlines 
<https://bloom.bg/4qUHjO6> on Venezuela. That said, Argentina may be the true 
test <https://bloom.bg/4pGZnKu> of Trump’s Latin America power play.

The US and Greenland will likely  reach some kind of beneficial agreement 
<https://bloom.bg/49ExkFA>, the US Ambassador to Belgium said, while underlying 
Trump’s commitment to NATO. Denmark PM Mette Frederiksen said she’ll continue 
to push back against American efforts to take over the island after Wednesday’s 
high-level meetingfailed to defuse US threats <https://bloom.bg/45OSkbt> over 
Greenland’s future. Germany istaking the lead <https://bloom.bg/4b0zQIB> of 
European nations sending military personnel to the island.
 <https://bloom.bg/4b0zQIB> 
One step forward, two steps back. Trump faulted Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr 
Zelenskiy <https://bloom.bg/3NnPa8m> as the main obstacle to an agreement to 
end the war Russia launched four years ago. The comments mark a shift from 
recent weeks, in which he’d expressed frustration with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. 
Trump has oscillated between blaming Ukraine and Russia for failing to reach an 
accord. US and Ukrainian officials have said they’ve made significant progress 
on a 20-point plan to end the fighting, but Kyiv and Moscowremain at an impasse

Amazon is challenging Saks Global Enterprises’ bid to fund its bankruptcy with 
financing that would provide the retailer with as much $1.75 billion in fresh 
cash. It claims the luxury retailer breached a deal related to the sale of Saks 
products on its website, and that its equity investment in the now bankrupt 
business is“presumptively worthless.” <https://bloom.bg/45eYKR8> In other tech

 Deep Dive: LIV Golf Is Losing its Grudge Match

LIV Golf’s $5 billion gamble to challenge the PGA Tour is faltering, with low 
attendance and lackluster TV viewership. The Saudi-backed rebel league is now
seeking a truce <https://bloom.bg/4qVqhQ2> after a thorny grudge match 
<https://bloom.bg/4qnpAPx> that threatened the game’s old order.

 * But the PGA Tour isn’t sitting still. With new management and  backing from 
sports-obsessed billionaires <https://bloom.bg/4qk4L7t> including Steven Cohen 
and John Henry, it’s also looking to improve its relationships with Washington 
and golfer-in-chief Donald Trump, once seen as LIV’s ace card. 
 * The new Returning Member Program could allow elite defectors to come back. 
Five-time major champion Brooks Koepka, who left LIV in December, will tee up 
on the PGA Tour this month—though it will cost him handsomely. 
 * Meanwhile, LIV is attempting to switch to the PGA Tour’s 72-hole format, 
which would mean its players could qualify for official world golf ranking 
points. “So, what’s different, you know, apart from the money?” said star 
golfer and long-time LIV critic Rory McIlroy. 
 * The Northern Irishman’s nail-biting victory at last year’s Masters was 
watched by an average 12.7 million viewers <https://bloom.bg/3YGdJ2N>, numbers 
LIV can only dream of.

Generic Ozempic is coming as key patents start to fall. That’s good news for 
the millions who still can’t access the revolutionary diabetes drug. Not so for 
its maker, Novo Nordisk, as dozens of manufacturerslimber up for a price war 
<https://bloom.bg/4qO78zg> that could send the monthly cost as low as $15 in 
some countries.

When the US administration interferes with monetary policy, it’s harder for 
the central bank to deliver what the White House wants: a lower cost of 
finance, Michael Bloomberg writes. This is a formula for financial panic and 
economic disaster and the presidentneeds to change course 
<https://bloom.bg/3NlhBDY>, he says.

Watch of the century? The $170,000 François-Paul Journe Chronomètre à 
Résonance may lack the instant recognition and brazen bling of the Rolex 
Rainbow Daytona, and it’s no match for the Apple Watch’s technological 
revolution. But its twin mechanismsoffer something more universal 
<https://bloom.bg/4pIQIHD>: synchrony—an idea that captivates collectors and 
artists alike.
