Donald Trump’s threat to impose levies on countries opposing his plans to 
acquire Greenland is rattling markets and allies alike. Europe’s leaders appear 
to be overcoming their traditional reluctance to confront the US president, 
with Germany warning that Trump has reached a red line 
<https://bloom.bg/4a2oAKL> and the European Union in talks about imposing 
retaliatory tariffs on€93 billion of US goods <https://bloom.bg/49JbxNc>. 
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hasdoubled down <https://bloom.bg/4sJ6g0R>, 
saying the US won’t back down on taking over Greenland. And Trump linked his 
claims to his grievance over not receivingthe Nobel Peace Prize 
<https://bloom.bg/3Lq5K78>.

Gold and silver surged to record highs <https://bloom.bg/3YIfaxP> as US 
futures and European stocks tumbled on fears of adamaging trade war 
<https://bloom.bg/49uKDK6>. Cryptocurrencies also took a hit 
<https://bloom.bg/3LpZOuR>. Some market players see a chance that Trump’s 
latest maneuver may end uphurting the dollar <https://bloom.bg/4bGlKMN>, though 
hedge funds recently closed theirbullish euro positions 
<https://bloom.bg/4b8sOli>.

The Trump administration is moving to bolster law enforcement and potentially 
send military personnel <https://bloom.bg/3Z6nuHX> to Minneapolis, where 
immigration agents have clashed with protesters. The Pentagon has ordered 1,500 
US troops based in Alaska to prepare, and theFBI is asking agents  
<https://bloom.bg/4b8sPpm>nationwide to volunteer for temporary duty in 
Minneapolis.

A friendlier face? BlackRock’s Rick Rieder appears to be gaining late momentum 
<https://bloom.bg/4r4DzK8> in the race to be the Federal Reserve’s next chair, 
as Trump weighs potential congressional blowback over some of his choices. 
White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett has signaledhe may stay in his 
current role <https://bloom.bg/4jQ8PtO>, taking him out of contention to 
succeed Jerome Powell.

Diplomacy with a price tag. Trump is floating a $1 billion fee 
<https://bloom.bg/4jR4Zkb> for a permanent seat on his proposed “Board of 
Peace,” with himself as chairman and final arbiter. Former UK Prime Minister 
Tony Blair, who’s been appointed to the board’s executive panel, has made clear
he’s not a fan <https://bloom.bg/462rxZo> of the idea.

 Deep Dive: ‘Soak the Rich’ 

 <https://bloom.bg/49EvlRG> Palm Beach is a popular relocation choice for 
high-net worth New Yorkers.Photographer: Saul Martinez/Bloomberg 
From New York City to Paris, authorities are turning toward a familiar source 
of funds to repair their scarred balance sheets: the wealthy. Advocates see 
wealth taxes as a much-needed measure to combat widening inequality. But the 
simple truth is that they’re often tough to implement <https://bloom.bg/49EvlRG>
.

 * In California, a proposed billionaire tax is drawing opposition from a 
growing group of top state Democrats <https://bloom.bg/3LPoqgC>. Some wealthy 
peoplehave already left <https://bloom.bg/4r6uNv7>—even though Nvidia CEO 
Jensen Huang has said he’s “perfectly fine <https://bloom.bg/4sOprGe>” with the 
proposed measure. 
 * Cities such as Miami have benefited from high-net-worth individuals and 
firms relocating from New York <https://bloom.bg/4qYWF47>, while Texas has also 
emerged as an attractive destination <https://bloom.bg/4bFdCfu> for hundreds of 
companies bringing employees with them. 
 * Still, there are some good reasons behind the idea of wealth taxes. 
Research shows that the very well-off often enjoy lower effective tax rates 
<https://bloom.bg/49KPBB6>, even as the gap between rich and poor is rising.

What happens in Vegas doesn’t stay in Vegas—at least not for Sphere. The 
futuristic venue operator is bringing its glowing $2.3 billion orb act, one of 
the top-grossing attractions worldwide, to the Washington metropolitan area 
<https://bloom.bg/49sVGDv>. The new 6,000-seat venue will rise in National 
Harbor, Maryland, about 15 minutes from the US capital.
