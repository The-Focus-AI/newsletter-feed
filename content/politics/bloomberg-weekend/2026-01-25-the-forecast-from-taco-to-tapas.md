Welcome back to The Forecast <https://bloom.bg/4grD73x> from Bloomberg Weekend 
<https://bloom.bg/3ZHmDgw>, where we help you think about the future — from 
next week to next decade.

We start this weekend with the limits of TACO. Then we’re looking at the 
prospects for Mark Carney’s “middle powers,” Europe’s “age of humiliation” and 
the healing power of llamas — really. Plus, prediction markets on the Fed chair 
race and this weekend’s snowstorm in the eastern US.

 The Trouble With TACO 

US President Donald Trump backed down this week from his threat to tariff 
European allies who resisted his demands on Greenland. Cue thechorus 
<https://bloom.bg/3ZwGqzy> of commentary dubbing this more evidence of TACO: 
Trump Always Chickens Out <https://bloom.bg/4qzmsjv>. 

But there are two problems with the TACO theory that bear watching as we head 
into the second year of Trump’s second term.

The first is that Trump absolutely does do stuff. Not everything he says he 
will; prediction markets, for example,do seem to overrate his follow-through 
<https://bloom.bg/4qGtBij>. But Bloomberg GeoEconomics recently looked at 
Trump’s threats to attack other countries or non-state actors and found that 
he’s followed through on 60% of them in his second term thus far. (Link for 
Bloomberg Terminal subscribers only. <https://bloom.bg/4rhztOW>) Then there are 
tariffs, which for all the stepdowns remain roughly four times what they were 
prior to this administration — the highest level since the 1930s.

The second problem is what economist Arin Dube calls the “TACO Cycle.” 

If investors expect Trump to back down, that expectation will be absorbed into 
stock prices. But if Trump is only convinced to change course when the market 
dips, increased volatility and brinksmanship become inevitable. For Trump to 
back down, he needs to go further than markets are bargaining for and convince 
even TACO-pilled investors thatthis time is different. 

“Over time, this will lead to bigger and bigger crises,” Dube explained on X 
<https://bloom.bg/4pU9Ke8>, “because the markets are updating about TACO, so it 
will take more extreme action to make markets [think] he may not actually TACO.”

For Dube, this is a recipe for escalation, as it takes ever-more extreme 
action to jolt markets. The paradoxical corollary to TACO, then, is TAPAS: 
TACO’s already priced, amplifying shocks.

 Predictions 

Ads will reshape ChatGPT — and not in a good way. “In an ideal world Altman 
will resist the warped incentives of online advertising. But history shows that
ads reshape internet platforms <https://bloom.bg/4qGtByP>. There’s little 
reason to think ChatGPT will prove the exception.”— Parmy Olson, Bloomberg 
Opinion

India will be the world’s first electrostate. “China’s rapid electrification 
has been hailed as a miracle. By some measures,India is even further ahead 
<https://bloom.bg/49FpQ6x>.” — Akshat Rathi, Bloomberg Green

Europe is entering an age of humiliation. “Eurocrats argue that they must earn 
a seat at the table to avoid becoming part of the menu… But the truth is that
the chances of bold reforms may already have gone <https://bloom.bg/4adHhew>.” 
— Adrian Wooldridge, Bloomberg Opinion

Big Pharma’s next breakthrough will be derived from llamas. Yes, you read that 
right: “Scientists have discoveredthe potential of the animals’ antibodies 
<https://bloom.bg/4qBgZbX> to thwart multiple diseases, and now drug developers 
are collectively plowing billions of dollars into a field that may yield a 
fresh generation of life-changing medicines.”— Lisa Pham, Bloomberg News 

Zero-sugar soda will steal market share from diet soda. “Both Diet and Zero 
Sugar are calorie free, artificially sweetened imitations of their sugary 
brethren. Yet, the latter’s brandingresonates more with younger, 
wellness-minded consumers <https://bloom.bg/4adNQhe>.” — Kristina Peterson, 
Bloomberg News 

 What Are the Chances... 

The Search for a Fed Chair Continues

Trump’s pick for Fed chair could come as soon as next week 
<https://bloom.bg/3YY2Vxa>, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent — 
though the search has become something of a unicorn hunt,as Bloomberg News 
described this week <https://bloom.bg/45tp8Xw>.

To recap: In late October, Bloomberg reported that the search was down to five 
candidates <https://bloom.bg/46ejs3V>; in late November, National Economic 
Council Director Kevin Hassettappeared to be the frontrunner 
<https://bloom.bg/49DOeFE>; earlier this month, Trump suggested he’d like to 
keep Hassett where he is <https://bloom.bg/4t3yELe>. The current shortlist is 
reportedly <https://bloom.bg/45tp8Xw> BlackRock executive Rick Rieder 
<https://bloom.bg/3NBtp5b>, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and former 
governor Kevin Warsh.

Here’s how the race has played out on Polymarket <https://bloom.bg/4iuPAW1>, 
where $245 million in total trades have been made so far:

Also, in case you were wondering: There are multiple prediction markets 
forecasting this weekend’s snowstorm in the US <https://bloom.bg/3LQwEFl>.

 Keep an Eye On 

Carney’s “Middle Powers” Are Behind on AI

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney made waves this week in Davos with a speech
 <https://bloom.bg/4t3WPJy> urging the world’s “middle powers” to resist 
economic coercion and band together. Easier said than done, of course. But one 
challenge stands out: No matter how one defines “middle powers,” they remain 
far behind the US and China on AI, the most important technology of this era.

All of the top 10 AI models are from companies headquartered in either the US 
or China,according to Artificial Analysis <https://bloom.bg/3ZsV4rt>. South 
Korea has acouple of models <https://bloom.bg/3O4IYSU> in the top 30; so does 
theUnited Arab Emirates <https://bloom.bg/4a9ems9>. France has one; the UK’s 
DeepMind is a bit of an asterisk as it’s a major player but part of Google. 
(Carney would no doubt note that Toronto is asignificant AI research hub 
<https://bloom.bg/46acFbq>, though it is not home to a top-30 LLM provider.) 

“We’ve seen competitive models emerge from non-US, non-China firms at various 
points, but few have managed to keep pace given the immense financial and 
talent demands necessary to sustain development at the frontier,” says Michael 
Deng, an analyst at Bloomberg GeoEconomics. “If AI models become the 
foundational infrastructure of the future economy, that infrastructure will be 
controlled almost entirely by American and Chinese players. For everyone else, 
this deepens their existing dependencies on either the US or China — and it’s 
the exact opposite of the strategic flexibility Carney called for.”

Even if those non-US, non-China models prove good enough, the middle powers 
are well behind in compute, too. The US and China together account for about 
87% of AIcomputing power globally <https://bloom.bg/3LRORlJ>.

There is a view that AI models are becoming commoditized, in which case the 
real value could be in the applications that are built on top of the LLMs. But 
there again, the middle powers have some catching up to do. In 2018, BCG 
concluded that “18 of the top 20 internet companies <https://bloom.bg/49U79L8>” 
were headquartered in either the US West Coast or the east coast of China.

These two “gold coasts” have dominated the internet economy, and building 
world-class AI applications outside of them will be an uphill battle. If Carney 
and his allies hope to form a new geopolitical bloc, they’ll have to give it a 
try.
