Welcome to the weekend!

After a 40% drop in 2025, renowned bakery chain Greggs ended the year as the 
UK’s most-shorted stock. Which British pastry is the chain known for selling?

For a different kind of treat, tune in the latest episode of The Mishal Husain 
Show <https://bloom.bg/4o25yc7>, in which New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen 
explains how Democrats are trying to check Donald Trump.

 Hot and Cold 

When Mishal Husain spoke with New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen on Tuesday, 
five Republicans had joined Democrats to advance legislation opposing further 
US military action in Venezuela. Less than 48 hours later, the effort collapsed 
after a barrage of calls from Donald Trump to the GOP defectors. It’s the 
latest example of a gap between legislative and executive power that Shaheen, 
the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, knows is a 
political liability for her party. “We think about it every day,” she says. “
What can we do to address the policy decisions this administration is making?”

Even at its most effective, Congress would have struggled to keep up this 
month: Trump has come in hot on Venezuela, Iran and Greenland. But in Venezuela 
at least, the question is whether the president’s version of the Monroe 
Doctrine can truly counter China’s slow-burn entrenchment in the region. 
Beijing has been expanding trade and investment — first in extractive 
industries, then in energy, infrastructure and manufacturing. “As an 
alternative to China, the US has little to offer instead,” writes Jorge Heine, 
Chile’s ambassador to China from 2014 to 2017. He calls Trump’s policy “all 
sticks and no carrots.”

In geopolitics, it’s a problem if a cold war suddenly turns hot. In wellness, 
alternating between hot and cold environments can reduce inflammation and speed 
recovery. That’s one reason bathhouses are booming in cities like London, New 
York and Los Angeles — but it’s far from the only reason. Today’s chic new 
saunas aim to replace the coffee shop, pub or nightclub, serving as “third 
spaces” (not home, not work) for an always-online generation looking to unplug 
and connect. “In the sauna it’s very easy [to talk to strangers]” the head of 
the Oslo Sauna Association tells Madison Darbyshire. “You can just say, ‘It’s 
very hot.’”

About 9,000 miles south of Scandinavia’s famed saunas, Carlo Barbante stands 
in an underground ice chamber in Antarctica, which he describes as both “very 
evocative” and “very, very cold.” The cave, engineered to hold a steady −50C 
(−58F), will store ice cores from glaciers around the world, preserving a 
chemical record of Earth’s past climate. With glaciers on track to shrink to 
one-fifth of their current volume by 2100, preservation has become urgent. 
Housing the cores in a naturally frozen environment capable of withstanding 
extreme change gives this archive a fighting chance, Lou Del Bello writes.

 Dispatches 

Myamnar
In the shadow of Yangon’s Shwedagon Pagoda, Buddhist chants drift through a 
modest hall repurposed as a polling station. Its gates are open, waiting — but 
nearly five years after a coup toppled Myanmar’s elected government, voters are 
scarce and expectations low. There are no major opposition parties on the 
ballot, democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi is in prison, and dozens of townships 
remain mired in civil conflict. Yet in a world increasingly shaped by resource 
scarcity, Myanmar’s rare-earth reserves have become strategic bargaining chips 
— and even a sham election offers governmentsa procedural pretext to reengage 
with the junta <https://bloom.bg/45M4FNG>.

Ireland
In a sold-out Dublin arena, thousands of Kneecap fans chant Irish-language rap 
about drugs, anti-establishment anger and national identity. The crowd is a 
wash of green, white and orange balaclavas — popularized by the band’s DJ, 
Próvaí — alongside Irish tricolors and Palestinian flags. Formed in 2017, 
Kneecap is today selling out arenas with a message centered on a united 
Ireland. The band’s nationalist imagery draws on that tradition, but their 
politics are unmistakably contemporary: left-wing, iconoclastic and 
pro-Palestinian. For some, the symbols recall the Troubles. For fans, they’re 
worn with irony —the soundtrack of a younger generation

 Agree or Disagree? 

McKinsey could learn something from MAGA. Too much of management theory still 
assumes it’s the 1990s,clinging to free trade and stakeholder capitalism 
<https://bloom.bg/4qt1piJ> even as geopolitics hardens around supply chains, 
technology and national security.

The guardrails of presidential power are holding. Subpoenas against the 
Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell looked like a bombshell, but the backlash 
from markets, courts and the Senate suggestsTrump 2.0 is not all-powerful after 
all <https://bloom.bg/45iHuul>.

Young men aren’t opting out — they’re stalled. Generation Desperation argues 
that men’s retreat into online life reflects economic precarity, not apathy. 
They’re stuckbetween adulthood’s expectations and its modern realities 
<https://bloom.bg/3NNFLqK>. 

 The College Cliff 

 “A college isn’t a Starbucks. You lose decades of knowledge and tradition 
when you lose a college <https://bloom.bg/3NnR2hr>.” 
Kevin Carey VP for education and work, New America think tank 
 America’s college system is colliding with a hard demographic reality. As the 
US birth rate plunges, shrinking classes of high school graduates are leaving 
hundreds of campuses fighting for survival. The result is a painful shakeout 
that’s closing schools, stranding students and forcing higher education to 
confront a business model built for a population that no longer exists. 

 Is It Worth It? 

A blue-zone retreat: Yes — but know why you’re going. These places are famous 
for longevity, but their real lesson is about thehealth effects of belonging to 
a community <https://bloom.bg/45iBAcC>.

The $47,250 Mercedes-Benz CLA with MB.Drive Assist Pro: Depends! The car feels 
genuinely autonomous <https://bloom.bg/3NOyZ41>, but that autonomy doesn’t yet 
work on highways.

Natural wine: Mostly yes. The movement has improved how wine is made, but 
quality varies. The payoff depends less on ideologythan on who imported the 
bottle <https://bloom.bg/3NOmF3O>.

A $50 Le Creuset mystery box: Only if the unknown is the draw. Mystery boxes 
provide dopamine hits and unboxing fun, buttheir odds favor the retailer. 
<https://bloom.bg/4pOQlLJ>

The $170,000 Chronomètre à Résonance: You do you. The “most important 
wristwatch of the 21st century” uses resonance — two balance wheels that 
synchronize with each other — making itpart timepiece, part engineering feat
