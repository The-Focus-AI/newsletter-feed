For much of last year, something called the “TACO trade” became quite the 
sensation on Wall Street. Short for “Trump Always Chickens Out,” it was an 
often-profitable bet the US president’s tariff threats against countries and 
industries would eventually end with him backing down and declaring victory. 
Though—and especially in the case of China—this sometimes resulted in a “deal” 
more favorable to the target than the US.

While doubts have been growing about the TACO trade’s efficacy 
<https://bloom.bg/3YO30DF>, Wednesday’s rousing market close 
<https://bloom.bg/3ZqcCVc> showed there still may be something to it. After 
weeks of fresh threats to buy, annex or invade Greenland, andresulting European 
fury <https://bloom.bg/4pN15dz> about an America gone rogue 
<https://bloom.bg/4pUEID5>, Trump backed down <https://bloom.bg/4r0LDLF> on 
using force <https://bloom.bg/4qy2mpT>. He also retreated on promised tariffs 
<https://bloom.bg/3YQZjgo> against European nations who oppose his territorial 
ambitions <https://bloom.bg/3LXNdz6>. But the Republican said he still wants 
Greenland.

Despite his subsequent claim of a “framework of a future deal” for Greenland 
sans details, the Danes are having none of it. Foreign Minister Lars Lokke 
Rasmussen rejected any talks on a takeover. “We will not enter into any 
negotiations on the basis of giving up fundamental principles,” he told 
reporters in Copenhagen. “That is something we will never do.”—David E. Rovella

Also at Davos, Citadel’s Ken Griffin said heavy selling of Japanese government 
bonds this week should serve as an “explicit warning” to US politicians to 
improve the nation’s finances.

“The bond vigilantes can come out and extract their price 
<https://bloom.bg/3YQJO8k>,” Griffin told Bloomberg Television. “What happened 
in Japan is a very important message to the House and to the Senate: You need 
to get our fiscal house in order.” The Republican-controlled Congress last 
summer pushed through a massive tax-and-spending bill sought by Trump that, 
largely through tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy, set the USon a path 
to $40 trillion national debt <https://bloom.bg/45ZLlMX>.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeted a new Democratic-run state 
this week, this timefocusing on Somali immigrants living in Maine 
<https://bloom.bg/45ZLhgb>. Local officials in Portland and Lewiston, Maine’s 
largest cities, say they’ve received reports about an increased presence of ICE 
agents on their streets. So far, they appear to be targeting people they’ve 
identified ahead of time rather than patrolling neighborhoods in large numbers, 
Portland Mayor Mark Dion said.

The Trump administration meanwhile won a temporary reprieve in a lawsuit over 
ICE tactics in Minnesota, where one of its agents shot dead Renee Good. An 
appellate court put on hold a ruling restricting officers from interfering with 
protesters in the state inviolation of their constitutional rights 
<https://bloom.bg/4qXpQo4>.

The Supreme Court’s GOP-appointed supermajority spent much of 2025 clearing a 
path, albeit temporarily, for Trump to consolidate power over traditionally 
independent agencies by firing Democratic-appointed officials. But the 
conservativestelegraphed their desire to find some sort of exception 
<https://bloom.bg/49SBnyp> when it came to the Federal Reserve, something made 
more clear at oral arguments today.

The justices suggested they are wary of Trump’s effort to fire Fed Governor 
Lisa Cook over unproven mortgage-fraud allegations, saying the move could upend 
the central bank’s independence and rattle markets. Trump’s own appointees were 
among the skeptics: Brett Kavanaugh said the president’s position would “weaken 
if not shatter the independence of the Federal Reserve.” Amy Coney Barrett 
asked whether the risk to financial markets was reason for “caution on our part 
<https://bloom.bg/45TirOA>.”

California Governor Gavin Newsom, seen as a likely frontrunner for the 
Democratic presidential nomination in 2028, said he was denied entry to an 
event at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum after pressure from the 
White House.

Newsom had been invited to speak at an event at the USA House, a venue 
showcasing US companies at Davos. The USA House “under pressure from the White 
House and State Department” restricted his entrance to the area, Newsom’s 
office said in a social media post. Anna Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Trump 
administration, referred to Newsom as “third-rate governor Newscum 
<https://bloom.bg/45mpqzq>” in a White House statement responding to the 
allegation.

OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman has been meeting with top investors 
in the Middle East to line up funding for a new investment round that could 
total at least $50 billion, at avaluation of about $750 billion to $830 billion 
<https://bloom.bg/45SQCpE>. Altman is said to have recently visited the region, 
where he spoke with investors, including some of the leading state-backed funds 
in Abu Dhabi.

OpenAI has raised billions of dollars in recent years to help finance the 
immense cost of chips, data centers and talent to build new artificial 
intelligence systems and support wider adoption of the technology. The startup, 
which like its rivals is not yet profitable, has committed to spend more than 
$1.4 trillion on AI infrastructure.
