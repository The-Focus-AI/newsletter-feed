Welcome back to The Forecast <https://bloom.bg/4grD73x> from Bloomberg Weekend 
<https://bloom.bg/3ZHmDgw>, where we help you think about the future — from 
next week to next decade.

We start this weekend in Myanmar, where an election hints at the dangers of a 
world dominated by spheres of influence. Then, we check in on “vibecoding” and 
tech’s “tiny team era” and look at scenarios for Iran. Also, the race to make 
the cutest companion robot, and much more.

 Myanmar’s Potemkin Election 

Many countries turned their back on Myanmar after its military violently 
overthrew a civilian government nearly five years ago. Now some are signaling a 
return, more proof that in today’s resource-driven world, pragmatism trumps 
principle.

Myanmar’s election, currently being held over three phases 
<https://bloom.bg/3LLlQIm>, is a textbook Potemkin exercise. Its overwhelmingly 
popular opposition party is banned, its leaders are behind bars and vast areas 
are excluded from voting because of an ongoing conflict that haskilled thousands
 <https://bloom.bg/3LmOa3T>. 

The vote offers a veneer of legitimacy for a military that long envisioned 
Myanmar reintegrated into global trade after decades of isolation. For China, 
Russia, India and parts of Southeast Asia, that will in all likelihood be 
enough to deepen ties or reengage.

<https://bloom.bg/49GTp6B>

Others are waking up to the fact that China is consolidating influence in 
Myanmar, and staying on the sidelines risks ceding strategic ground in a 
country with vast oil deposits and a strategic maritime corridor linking India 
and Southeast Asia. Even the US has stepped back from condemning the vote, a 
stark reversal from earlier sanctions-driven policy.

In this election, minerals, oil and territory matter more than ballots, and 
Myanmar has them in spades. Of course, the transactional nature of geopolitics 
is not limited to Myanmar — if anything, it appears ascendant. Take Venezuela, 
where US President Donald Trump has moved toreassert control 
<https://bloom.bg/3ZhKl31> of vast oil reserves following the capture of 
Nicolas Maduro.

In a world where great powers compete for spheres of influence and control 
over natural resources <https://bloom.bg/4b1aDxK>, concern for democracy often 
takes a backseat to the need to secure influence and stability. In Myanmar, the 
result is that a once-shunned military regime is poised to become more relevant 
on the world stage.

 Predictions 

Europe’s political center of gravity could shift from Paris to Berlin. “There 
is a general sense of unease [in Paris] aboutGermany’s increasing military power
 <https://bloom.bg/4pE6DGZ> and the political capital that comes with it.” — 
Andrea Palasciano and Michael Nienaber, Bloomberg News

Central bank rate decisions are about to diverge: “From prospective hikes in 
Canada, Japan and Switzerland, to steady borrowing costs in the euro zone, to 
cuts in Australia and New Zealand,policy trajectories that were once far more 
in tandem <https://bloom.bg/4qrY0R1> may be about to stray noticeably.” — Craig 
Stirling, Bloomberg News

Markets will not be a chastening force on an emboldened Trump. “For all the 
dire predictions after his Department of Justice launched a probe on Federal 
Reserve Chair Jerome Powell,stocks and bonds are doing fine 
<https://bloom.bg/4b5F0Di>.” — Edward Harrison, The Everything Risk

America’s measles problem isn’t going anywhere. The outbreak that “drove cases 
to a 34-year high in 2025 shows no signs of slowing, as168 more people have 
become infected <https://bloom.bg/4pGktIX> since the start of the new year.” — 
Jessica Nix, Bloomberg News 

Generic Ozempic could bring monthly costs as low as $15 for users in some 
countries —from Canada and China to India and Brazil, though not the US. “For 
many consumers looking to control their weight, the global availability of 
non-patented versions will bea ‘hallelujah” moment <https://bloom.bg/49MsTZr>.’”
 — Amber Tong, Naomi Kresge, and Satviki Sanjay, Bloomberg News 

The Tech Left is reassembling. “Recent events, most prominently the killing of 
a Minneapolis woman <https://bloom.bg/4aZyX34> at the hands of an Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement agent, has awoken [it].” — Dave Lee, Bloomberg Opinion 

Space data centers could become a reality. Elon Musk’s plan for data centers 
in space is… not completely crazy. He’snot the only one thinking about it either
 <https://bloom.bg/4pGMDDT>. But “developing entirely new space hardware often 
takes much longer than expected, and it’s uncertain that this enterprise will 
ever be cost-effective.”— Loren Grush, Bloomberg News 

E-bikes are still the future: “E-bike companies have faced sagging demand 
along with escalating costs <https://bloom.bg/4pOvqIL>… [Yet] e-bikes’ North 
American future is brighter than the recent cascade of downbeat headlines would 
suggest.”— David Zipper, Bloomberg CityLab 

More and more podcasts will be consumed via AI summaries. “The industry is 
starting to reorganize around this new podcasting nucleus – clips – and the 
broader realization that manypeople are starting to tap out of consuming 
lengthy content <https://bloom.bg/4qtShKI>.” — Ashley Carman, Soundbite

 What Are the Chances... 

‘Tiny Teams’ and the Power of Ideas Over Execution

There’s a prediction here, we swear — but it’s at the end…

Last year we wrote about the idea of ”tiny teams” taking over tech 
<https://bloom.bg/4qAiyqU>, with “AI-native” startups proliferating 
<https://bloom.bg/4qvOeNY> and “bragging rights… going to entrepreneurs who 
keep headcount the lowest.”

How’s that going a year later? 

 * 
The AI buzz over the past few weeks has been about the power of Claude Code, 
and this week Anthropic debuted Claude Cowork, a tool that “looks like a 
chatbot, but with more functionality to actually do tasks on your behalf, 
including building apps, creating spreadsheets and sorting through troves of 
data.”Bloomberg AI reporter Shirin Ghaffary tested Cowork 
<https://bloom.bg/4qCorUj>: “In my own tests, I was able to quickly create a 
functional brainstorming app that looked like Trello to help organize my story 
ideas, with zero technical skill necessary.”

 * 
Meanwhile, Odd Lots’ Joe Weisenthal wrote about the results of his vibecoding 
experiments this week. “I’m obsessed with the idea of society becoming 
post-literate… Now I never learned to code. At all. I’m a wordcel. But I 
figured that maybe I could use the new coding tools to build software that 
scans a given body of text, and identifies whether the text resembles the 
written or the spoken word by picking up on some of those characteristics.”What 
last year took days,Joe did in minutes with Claude Code 
<https://bloom.bg/4qCorUj>. (Here’s his follow-up post 
<https://bloom.bg/45cbNTu> with more detail.)

 * 
Here’s Wharton entrepreneurship professor and AI power-user Ethan Mollick 
writing this week on X <https://bloom.bg/49r3gyz>: “Teaching an experimental 
class for MBAs on “vibefounding,” the students have four days to come up and 
launch a company…Everything they are doing in four days would have taken a 
semester in previous years, if it could have done it at all. Quality is also 
far better.”

But what does all this vibecoding add up to? Will it actually create 
successful companies built around tiny teams? Forecasters say probably.

The Forecasting Research Institute asked its AI expert panel 
<https://bloom.bg/4jSXJ7u> — more on that here <https://bloom.bg/49HIucy> — to 
predict in what year “at least three companies with five or fewer full-time 
employees first report individual valuations of $10 billion… or more?” Their 
answer: “The median expert gives a 50% chance of [that happening] by the end of 
2032.”

This prediction format is a bit less intuitive than the percentages from 
prediction markets, but here’s the upshot:These AI experts think it’s more 
likely than not that we’ll see a $10 billion company of five or fewer people 
within the next six years. 

It’s hard to exaggerate how different all of this is from even recent eras in 
technology. When I started covering startups more than a decade ago, one truism 
reigned supreme: Ideas are a dime a dozen; it’s execution that matters. Today, 
is that still true? Execution — or at least some of it — is becoming 
commoditized in much of software and now in other parts of knowledge work. The 
bottleneck to building something new is increasingly whether you have a great 
idea.

editor at FRI.)

What Happens Next in Iran: Strongman, Coup or Collapse?

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is not just the iron fist deployed to 
put down demonstrations; it’s also the group with the most to lose if the 
system falls.

Even if the IRGC puts down the protests, its influence won’t end there. In the 
event of a military confrontation with the US, its commanders will lead the 
fight. If there’s a diplomatic settlement or domestic leadership reshuffle, it 
will run through its ranks of members and veterans, who span all key branches 
of the state. If this proves to be the beginning of the end for the Islamic 
Republic, the IRGC will be pivotal to what comes next.

Here are three scenarios of what that might look like.

Strongman: Islamic Republic But With a Twist

There’s no shortage of strongmen within the IRGC’s current and former ranks. 
An insider, or a group of them, could emerge as candidates to take the reins. 
To survive and stave off more protests, these new leaders would need to address 
the grievances of those who have taken to the streets in recent weeks, starting 
with inflation. That would mean dealing with Trump — only he can provide 
much-needed sanctions relief to help revive the economy — a hard pill to 
swallow for the IRGC.

Coup: Under New Management

The Guards have the means to take over. If forced to choose between losing 
their grip on power and governing directly to maintain it, they would likely 
opt for the latter — though it's not their preferred outcome. Governing would 
saddle them with responsibility for Iran’s economic, political, social and 
environmental crises, requiring tough choices they are loath to make. That’s a 
far cry from their current privileged position as an influential political, 
military and foreign policy player, wielding power from the shadows and acting 
as middleman for a$475 billion economy <https://bloom.bg/45eZm9t>.

Slow Death: End of the Road

A collapse of the Islamic Republic could result in chaos instead, as groups 
and individuals jostle for power in the vacuum left behind. This is the IRGC’s 
worst-case scenario. For now, the government remains in control as it cracks 
down hard in the hope that it will knock the wind out of the protests.

So what comes next? Much depends on the Guards and the wildcard that is Trump. 
Left to the IRGC alone, the crackdown would continue. Only when the threat 
becomes existential is it likely to consider cutting a deal with Trump to save 
itself.
