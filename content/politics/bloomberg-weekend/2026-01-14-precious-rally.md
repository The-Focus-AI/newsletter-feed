Metals continued their dramatic start <https://bloom.bg/45UgscO> to the year 
as investors bet that prices could be boosted by more US interest-rate cuts and 
an economic revival in China. Silver topped $90 an ounce for thefirst time 
<https://bloom.bg/4pFO7y7>, while gold racked up another all-time high. Tin, 
boosted by its use in electronics and packaging,was the standout 
<https://bloom.bg/3ZhSKDz> among base metals. We break down the situation 
<https://bloom.bg/4pzOaLF> in this video.

Donald Trump dismissed Jamie Dimon’s criticism of the Justice Department probe 
into the Federal Reserve, saying the JPMorgan head was “wrong 
<https://bloom.bg/4jCHtHn>” to suggest he was undermining the independence of 
the central bank. That came afterDimon yesterday expressed concern 
<https://bloom.bg/4qYQsp3> about the investigation into the Fed’s headquarters 
renovation, and said anything risking the bank’s independence is “not a good 
idea.” As this plays out, Jeanine Pirro defended her decision to subpoena the 
Fed, saying “no one is above the law <https://bloom.bg/4jAL9JG>.”

Wall Street is scrambling to respond to Trump's demand 
<https://bloom.bg/4pGXYnn> for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates. 
JPMorgan said “everything is on the table <https://bloom.bg/4bxn8kM>” to push 
back against the request. There’s a lot at stake: A proposed rate ceiling would
deal a heavy blow <https://bloom.bg/3YEOuxN> to the $70 billion market that 
bundles the debt into bonds.

Geopolitics: Trump urged Iranians to keep protesting, saying he would “act 
accordingly <https://bloom.bg/4pzUJhn>” once he assesses the death toll. Top 
diplomats from Greenland and Denmark are gearing up for akey meeting 
<https://bloom.bg/3Zc0Ptz> today with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of 
State Marco Rubio. And the majority of Venezuelans want María Corina Machado to 
lead their country following the capture of Nicolás Maduro,a poll found

 Deep Dive: Not So Dry 

 <https://bloom.bg/4pBWAlG> 
Alcohol consumption may be declining as drinking culture changes, but people 
still want a buzz <https://bloom.bg/4pBWAlG>.

 * The number of drinkers has declined, with a Gallup poll showing the lowest 
share of alcohol-consuming adults in its 90-year history, with Dry January 
<https://bloom.bg/45Umzhh> in full swing. 
 * Many are still drinking, but their habits are changing—with some opting for 
 low-or no-alcohol <https://bloom.bg/4jICuVM> alternatives, or drinking at home 
as costs of a night out have shot up. 
 * Also having an impact: Weight-loss medications are altering some people’s 
appetite for booze, as well as food. Others are swapping a drink for a THC 
edible <https://bloom.bg/4pCdZuE>, as cannabis is legalized in more places.
