 Slow Reckonings 

If the US has one enduring advantage, it’s the ability to draw talent and grow 
its population. For years, the country largely sidestepped demographic anxiety: 
As recently as 2023, the Census Bureau projected the first population decline 
wouldn’t come until 2081. That assumption is eroding fast. As Trump’s 
immigration crackdown drives net migration down, new research suggests the US 
could see its first-ever population decline as soon as this year. Trump argues 
fewer immigrants mean lower costs and more opportunity for native-born workers, 
Shawn Donann writes, but many economists are unconvinced.

 Weekend Essay  <https://bloom.bg/4qfoowP> 
 The US Is Flirting With Its First-Ever Population Decline  
<https://bloom.bg/4qfoowP> 
Population decline was decades away. Now it’s at America’s door.

The effects of population decline on the US economy are likely to be corrosive 
rather than immediate — a pattern America has seen before. Cover-ups like the 
Army’s handling of the My Lai massacre in 1969 or the government surveillance 
exposed by Edward Snowden in 2013 can leave lasting damage on a democracy if 
accountability never follows, says filmmaker Laura Poitras, whose latest film,
Cover-Up, profiles investigative journalist Seymour Hersh. Mishal Husain spoke 
to Poitras about mass surveillance, her experience on a terrorist watch list, 
and the ICE shootings in Minneapolis.

Pressure has a way of testing governments’ resolve. Three years ago, China 
appeared to be emerging as a new power broker in the Middle East, epitomized by 
its role in restoring diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Since 
then, a cascade of regional crises has exposed the limits of Beijing’s 
ambitions. As war, unrest and maritime insecurity reshaped the region, China 
largely stayed on the sidelines, reluctant to spend political capital or assume 
security responsibilities. The result: China’s Middle East moment has lost 
momentum, Peter Martin and Sam Dagher write, even as the US has reasserted 
itself in the region.

Reassessments often take time to play out. During the pandemic, reassurance 
around pregnancy focused on a simple fact: Babies rarely tested positive for 
Covid at birth. But new research suggests that measure missed something 
important. More sensitive testing and longer follow-up point to in-utero 
exposure that may subtly affect placental function and early brain development. 
Most exposed children will be fine, and the risks appear small. Still, with 
millions of pandemic-era babies now reaching early childhood, scientists say 
Covid’s quietest consequences may only now be coming into view.

 Dispatches 

Australia
When 21-year-old Luke McSorley lights a cigarette, he says it makes him feel 
like Don Draper. In Australia — which plasters cigarette packs with graphic 
warnings and prices them like luxury goods — that shouldn’t be the case. But 
vaping and a booming black market for cheap, illicit tobacco are attracting 
younger smokers, and experts warnAustralia’s anti-cig success story is starting 
to fray <https://bloom.bg/4a4XcdT>. One argues: “We got complacent as a nation.”

LinkedIn
A stray em dash, an emoji, a grand metaphor — on LinkedIn, these have become 
clues in a growing hunt for AI-written posts. As generative tools flood the 
platform, users are turning grammar quirks into supposed tells, calling out 
content they think was written by machines. The evidence is shaky and the 
accusations sometimes wrong, but the impulse reveals a professional network
grappling with anxiety over authenticity <https://bloom.bg/4aeH7Tk>.

 Conversation Starters 

Legal online betting is ruining sports. Frictionless apps have woven odds and 
wagers into broadcasts, flooded athletes with harassment and helpedturn fandom 
into a losing proposition <https://bloom.bg/4a10y1G> — all while scandals and 
conflicts of interest pile up.

Middle powers won’t save liberalism. Many of the states shaping global growth 
favor state capitalism and elite-led governance over liberal norms, andhave 
little reason to rally <https://bloom.bg/4q5ALeF> to the institutions Mark 
Carney wants them to defend.

The Fed is political but not partisan. Jerome Powell’s September 2024 rate cut 
was read as electioneering by Trump’s supporters, yet on close inspection
reflected market pressure and economic data <https://bloom.bg/4q3nvXT> rather 
than a bid to help Democrats.

 Alcohol Problem 

 “We didn’t see this violent crisis coming.  We haven’t yet hit bottom 
<https://bloom.bg/4qd4t1o>.” 
Thibaut Delrieu Managing director of Hine Cognac 
 The vineyards of Cognac are usually dormant in January. This year, producers 
are tearing out vines. After years of booming demand, France’s signature brandy 
is facing a sharp slowdown, swollen inventories and rising trade barriers. With 
shipments at their lowest since 2009, makers are slashing production and even 
weighing whether to destroy aging stock. 

 Is It Worth It? 

Congestion pricing: Yes, and not just in Manhattan. Most time savings have 
gone to drivers outside the toll zone, astraffic thinned in the boroughs and 
suburbs <https://bloom.bg/4q5kMgD>. 

A $64 steak au poivre at Raoul’s: Always. In a city where choosing wrong is 
pricey, this dish is a sure thing — which is why it’son our “Five Top Tables” 
list <https://bloom.bg/4bupnW6>.

The Sonos Amp Multi: Probably not? Sonos hasn’t announced a price for its 
first consumer product in a year, but the digital amplifier isaimed at advanced 
users <https://bloom.bg/4aaQ9Ax>.

A $28 martini: Honestly, yes. As drink menus get longer and pricier, the 
martini has become the safest order in the room:fast, adaptable and usually 
well made <https://bloom.bg/4qdLCTL>.

 One Last Thing 

 <https://bloom.bg/3ZHWeQ1> 
“There’s a perception that contraception is a solved problem.”  
<https://bloom.bg/3ZHWeQ1> 
For decades, male birth control barely moved beyond condoms and vasectomies. 
Now pills, gels and reversible implants are finally advancing through human 
trials. The science is real, but money, regulation and doubts about whether men 
will buy in still loom large.
