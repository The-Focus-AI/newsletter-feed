Good morning. Kevin Warsh will be the next head of the Fed. A mega music deal

decline for the first time in its history.Listen to the day’s top stories

 Market data may be delayed depending on provider agreements. 

The big reveal. Donald Trump chose Kevin Warsh <https://bloom.bg/4t8jvrP> to 
be the next head of the Federal Reserve. Stocks fell,the dollar rallied 
<https://bloom.bg/4qOq3u7> and Treasury yields pushed higher on what investors 
viewed as a hawkish pick. Gold and silversold off heavily 
<https://bloom.bg/3LFHMF6>. As if the metals market wasn’t volatile enough, the 
London Metal Exchangesuffered a one-hour delay <https://bloom.bg/3LSVNPL> at 
the start of Friday’s trading due to a possible technical issue. Oiltapped the 
brakes <https://bloom.bg/4t72gHl>, but Iran risks loom 
<https://bloom.bg/4a98aPH>.

Trump sued the Treasury and IRS for at least $10 billion over an unauthorized 
disclosure of his tax returns <https://bloom.bg/4c79hBU> during his first term. 
He also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on aircraft from Canada sold in the 
US and todecertify new planes <https://bloom.bg/4c1y2zx> unless Ottawa agrees 
to approve certain Gulfstream jets. Separately, Trumpwarned Canada and the UK 
<https://bloom.bg/4qLuENJ> against reaching new business deals with China. 
Meanwhile, his team reached a tentative deal with Senate Democrats to avert a 
government shutdown as they continue to negotiate on settinglimits on 
immigration raids <https://bloom.bg/49Pkc1L>. And this may help explain 
<https://bloom.bg/4amYtyn> Trump’s preoccupation with Venezuela.

The hills are alive...with the sound of a mega music deal 
<https://bloom.bg/4ajh66l>. BMG is considering an acquisition of Concord, a 
tie-up that would bring Kylie Minogue, Mötley Crüe and Miles Davis under one 
roof, along with classic show tunes fromThe Sound of Music and Cats. In other 
corporate news, Apple staged a sharp rebound in China over the holidays, as 
demand for the iPhone 17 droveits first $25 billion quarter 
<https://bloom.bg/4kbwaGw> in the region since late 2021. And Chevron topped 
profit estimates for the fourth quarter asoil production surged 
<https://bloom.bg/4t9InQ5>, money that’ll help fund Venezuelan investments 
<https://bloom.bg/3LUdiiH>. Exxon also beat <https://bloom.bg/4kaU9pd>.

Zohran Mamdani said Wall Street’s record profits won’t be enough to close 
NYC’s looming budget gap, warning the projected $12.6 billion deficit isworse 
than during the Great Recession <https://bloom.bg/3LSVSD3>. If that gets you 
down,have a martini <https://bloom.bg/3M7LrLM>; the New York classic is on 
every menu these days, from London to LA. Or take a break, in Milan maybe? With 
the Winter Olympics fast approaching and a slew of unsold seats, it’sthe 
perfect excuse <https://bloom.bg/4t9IoDD> for a last-minute trip, and probably 
cheaper than a Super Bowl ticket <https://bloom.bg/4bxNHGN>.

 Deep Dive: Walmart’s Next Chapter 

 <https://bloom.bg/4t9IpHH> Source: Walmart 
When John Furner takes the helm at Walmart next week, he’ll inherit a company 
riding high, with shares up 20% over the past year and a market value 
approaching $1 trillion.Keeping up that momentum <https://bloom.bg/4t9IpHH> 
will be the challenge.

 * Outgoing CEO Doug McMillon is widely viewed as having been the company’s  
most influential leader since its founder <https://bloom.bg/4akDITY>. He built 
an Apple-esque corporate campus in Arkansas, began selling Gucci online, and 
played nice with Trump. 
 * It was a stark turnaround from the early 2000s, when Walmart stores had 
endless queues, executives feared its own website, and critics accused it of 
hollowing out small towns. 
 * The 51-year-old Furner is a Walmart lifer and seen as close to McMillon. 
He’s known as tech savvy, detail oriented, and willing to challenge convention. 
 * But coming in at a high point leaves little room for missteps, especially 
with Amazon and Aldi biting at his heels <https://bloom.bg/4btwyxW> and a 
potentialrevival at Target <https://bloom.bg/4alSQQW>, which is also going 
through a changing of the guard. 

 The Big Take

If at first you don’t succeed…Uniqlo's billionaire founder is taking another 
swing at the US, and its wider waistlines. After years of failed attempts, can 
the Japanese retailerfinally crack the world’s largest clothing market 
<https://bloom.bg/4qPtalP>? “We’re only just getting started,” Tadashi Yanai 
says.

If Europe can’t find its footing, a continent once composed of empires will 
become a plaything of them, bringingmore pain and humiliation 
<https://bloom.bg/49OthYD>, writes Hal Brands. Given the scale of challenges 
facing the free world, that won’t be good for America either.

immigration crackdown means it could happen as soon as this year. Falling 
college enrollment and cities like Baltimore and Detroit offer a glimpse of
