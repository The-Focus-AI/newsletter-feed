US markets woke up <https://bloom.bg/4qpu2gC> from the extended Martin Luther 
King Jr. holiday weekend to an overnight bond implosion in Japan and fresh 
threats by Donald Trump, including tariff hikes and more allusions to attacking 
American allies.

Japan’s 40-year bond yield hit a record <https://bloom.bg/4qqenh2> amid 
heightened concern that a snap election called by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi 
might pave the way for policies that exacerbate the nation’s finances. Dealers 
said it was the most chaotic session in recent memory, withyields making their 
biggest move <https://bloom.bg/49xIiy0> since Trump announced his trade war on 
April 2.

Then there was American chaos to consider. Like something out of a dystopian 
thriller, the leader of Greenland on Tuesday warned his people toprepare for a 
US invasion <https://bloom.bg/4qEj8E4>. And having reportedly conceded that he 
wants to annex the massive island in part for “psychological 
<https://bloom.bg/3Nt9Wn7>” reasons (a 1951 treaty already gives the US free 
rein there militarily), the 79-year-old US president further stoked outrage 
with a middle-of-the-night social media post alluding to his supposed desire to 
annex Canada, too.

Throw in a fresh round of US tariff threats <https://bloom.bg/49tJLoY> against 
European nations (and a sprinkling of social media insults, some incapital 
letters <https://bloom.bg/4qxWwoA>) and “Sell America” returned to markets 
Tuesdaywith a vengeance <https://bloom.bg/45RclOI>. Treasuries tumbled and the 
dollar slid while the S&P 500 dropped more than 2%, erasing all of this year’s 
gains in the steepest decline in more than three months. The VIX Index, a 
measure of expected stock swings, hit the highest level since November. Gold 
spiked to a newrecord <https://bloom.bg/45QRXgG> of over $4,700 an ounce. Not 
unlike the experience of Japanese dealers earlier, it was the worst day in US 
markets since Trump’s so-called liberation day.

As for what happens next, some in Europe appear ready to move on entirely. As 
in, move on from America. The Danish pension fund AkademikerPension said it 
will exit US Treasuries by the end of the month, a once-unthinkable prospect 
ascribed to—among other things—Trump’s policies and the massive credit risk 
posed by the US itself.

“You cannot put the genie back into the bottle <https://bloom.bg/49QWUra>,” 
said Anders Schelde, the fund’s chief investment officer. “Things might get 
better and more calm a few months down the road, and Trump, he can’t be 
reelected, and the next president might be somewhat different,” he said. “But 
what comes then in five, six, 10 years?”—David E. Rovella

 What You Need to Know Today 

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney used a major address in Davos to urge 
world leaders to see the reality of a world that’sincreasingly governed by 
superpower aggression <https://bloom.bg/4bIXYzL>. Recent events have shown the 
“rules-based international order” is effectively dead, Carney said, which means 
Canada and other countries have no choice but to create new alliances to oppose 
pressure tactics and intimidation.

North America  <https://bloom.bg/3NvSz55> 
Canada’s Military Said to Have Modeled Hypothetical US Invasion  
<https://bloom.bg/3NvSz55> 
The military analyzed how it would respond to an American attack as Trump 
continues to muse about annexing the country, including in a late-night social 
media post with a colorful map.

Russia has reaped a windfall from a surge in gold prices since the start of 
its full-scale war in Ukraine <https://bloom.bg/4pNSBCU>, generating gains on a 
scale comparable to the sovereign reserves frozen in Europe.

Gold prices have rallied sharply over the past four years, supported by strong 
demand from central banks, persistent inflation concerns and heightened 
geopolitical risks driven in no small part by Russia’s aggression. During the 
last four years of the 12-year war, in which Russia has killed tens of 
thousands and is accused of scores of war crimes, the value of the Bank of 
Russia’s gold holdings has increased by more than $216 billion, according to 
Bloomberg calculations.
 <https://bloom.bg/4pNSBCU> 

Above and around the geopolitical upheaval, global warming continues to 
accelerate and climate change intensify. Indeed, a new era has begun of “global 
water bankruptcy,” with humans depleting freshwater systems to the point they 
can’t recover, according toa new United Nations report 
<https://bloom.bg/45QRTgW>.

Three-quarters of the world’s population—about 6.1 billion people—now live in 
countries where freshwater supplies are insecure or critically insecure.Four 
billion people face severe water scarcity <https://bloom.bg/4jSOvrK> for at 
least one month a year.
 <https://bloom.bg/4jSOvrK> 

The $5 trillion hedge fund industry posted its best returns 
<https://bloom.bg/4quo4eh> since the financial crisis last year, a welcoming 
reprieve for an asset class that’s been overshadowed by the rise of private 
alternatives.

A global stock boom lifted equity funds while macro traders thrived in 
Trump-driven volatility. Event-driven strategies also did well thanks to a 
surge in activist campaigns. By comparison, private credit was dogged by talk 
of “cockroaches <https://bloom.bg/4r8BJYK>” and regulatory concerns over 
systemic risks <https://bloom.bg/4r2BIoS>. And private equity continued to 
struggle with deal exits <https://bloom.bg/3YM0hdV> and returning cash to 
investors.

Still, Shuli Ren writes in Bloomberg Opinion, boutique funds have one more 
myth to bustbefore they can truly declare victory <https://bloom.bg/49x0FDh>.

Blackstone is in the early stages of weighing a sale of Beacon Offshore 
Energy, a Gulf of Mexico driller it has owned for about a decadethat could 
fetch more than $5 billion <https://bloom.bg/4qHpDFO>. 

US oil explorer consolidation in recent years has focused on shale operators, 
amid lower crude prices and a dwindling inventory of top-tier drilling spots on 
land. That slowdown in shale has helped fuel adrilling renaissance 
<https://bloom.bg/4qsyUl3> in the Gulf as Beacon lays claim to some of the most 
productive <https://bloom.bg/3LsK0Yi> wells in the US using new technology to 
pump hard-to-reach crude.

Hochul’s Budget Doesn’t Include a Tax Hike For Millionaires  
<https://bloom.bg/3YPhUJQ>

 What’s the Endgame for Trump’s Offensive Against Blue Cities?  
<https://bloom.bg/3NslQxG> 
Trump has pursued no goal more passionately or persistently than breaking the 
ability of Democratic jurisdictions to resist him. In the process, Ronald 
Brownstein writes, he is straining the nation’s fundamental cohesion in ways 
that may escalate beyond his control.
