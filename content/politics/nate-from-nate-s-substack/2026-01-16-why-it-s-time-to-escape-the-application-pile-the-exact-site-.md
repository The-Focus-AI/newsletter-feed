LinkedIn is dead. You know this. Everyone applying for jobs in 2025 knows this.
But watch what happens next. Watch the advice people give each other. Beat the ATS. Use power words. Network harder. Format your resume so the robots can parse it—but don’t sound too robotic or you’ll get filtered for seeming AI-generated. Use AI to help you apply—but not too much or they’ll catch you.
The response to LinkedIn dying is to optimize harder for LinkedIn.
I’ve been watching the discourse for weeks. Candidates gaming filters. Companies building better filters. Both sides escalating. For a lot of people, the success rate on applications now feels like it’s dropped below one percent. The entire infrastructure is optimized for filtering volume, not for understanding people—a resume compresses years of work into bullet points, an ATS scans for keyword matches, a recruiter spends six seconds deciding whether to keep reading. You’re competing for attention against hundreds of other compressed, keyword-optimized, six-second impressions.
Here’s the thing almost nobody has thought through: the arms race only exists because everyone accepts the premise. You’re a supplicant. They have gates. Your job is to squeeze through.
But the gates aren’t the only path anymore.
The same AI that broke hiring made something else possible. Three years ago, building a custom interface required engineering skills or real money. That gap closed. Which means you’re not stuck optimizing for their broken system. You can build the surface people encounter when they find you—something they can query, explore, discover. Not squeeze through their filters. Create your own.
Here’s what’s inside:
Why attention is the real bottleneck—and how building an interface shifts you out of the filtering pile entirely
The difference between asserting credentials and demonstrating capability—and why depth in an AI interface is almost impossible to fake
The bidirectional move—a fit assessment tool that tells employers not to hire you when the match is weak
The implementation spectrum—from a 30-minute text document to a weekend build, no engineering required
A full working demo—with source code and the exact prompts I used to build it (and yes, there’s beginners guide!)
But first, let’s walk through why this approach actually works.
