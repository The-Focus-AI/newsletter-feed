There are four principles that separate people who successfully build AI systems from people who get stuck and give up. And I didn’t learn them from a textbook. I learned them last week from watching dozens of people build the same system in completely different ways.
Last week I posted a video about building a second brain without code. It got a lot of traction. And what happened next taught me more about how building actually works in 2026 than anything I could have figured out on my own. People took the architecture I described and implemented it in tools I’d never recommended. They hit walls I hadn’t anticipated and found ways through. They used AI not just inside the system, but to help them construct the system. And patterns emerged.
The second brain was the project. What we learned building it together is about how complex systems actually get constructed now—in a world where you have AI as a collaborator and community as a pattern library.
Here’s what’s inside:
The four principles. One community member swapped out every tool I recommended and still got the same results. Another wrote a document that lets AI fix its own mistakes. These aren’t hacks—they’re a different way of thinking about what you’re actually building.
Where people got stuck. Five specific failure modes that cost hours to debug—until someone in the community figured them out. Now you can skip straight to the fix.
Inside the Zapier build. A walkthrough of my actual automation, with screenshots. Seeing the wiring helps more than any explanation.
Five patterns pointing forward. The community builds revealed something about where all of this is going—including one approach that might make fixed dashboards obsolete.
Let’s start with the principles.
