This week, two leading AGI-lab CEOs sat on the same stage and warned: timelines may be shorter than the public expects, and entry-level white-collar roles could be hit hard within years.
The same week, Apple effectively acknowledged it was behind in the foundation model race, signing a multi-year deal with Google. xAI closed one of the largest AI funding rounds on record—even as regulators in multiple countries investigate the platform over explicit AI-generated imagery. DeepSeek published a paper that could challenge the GPU memory wall. And a GitLab cofounder launched a direct assault on Lovable, Cursor, and Replit—all at once.
Here’s the thing: if you’re watching the takes, this looks like chaos. If you’re watching the capital flows, it’s coherent. Sovereign wealth funds are increasingly treating AI infrastructure as a strategic asset class. Apple is partnering with Google to catch up rather than building from scratch. The vibe coding market is consolidating around whoever ships fastest.
Davos told us where the power is concentrating. The funding rounds told us who has runway. The technical papers told us what’s actually changing under the hood.
Top Stories this week:
xAI closed a $20B Series E—reports peg valuation around $230B—with investors including sovereign wealth funds
Dario Amodei and Demis Hassabis discussed AGI timelines at Davos; Amodei argued 2026-27 is plausible for extremely capable systems, Hassabis described a more end-of-decade view
Apple officially partnered with Google to use Gemini as the foundation for next-gen Siri
DeepSeek published Engram, a conditional memory architecture that could partly bypass GPU memory constraints
Kilo Code launched App Builder, taking direct aim at Lovable and the vibe coding incumbents
Five stories. At least two will affect how you think about your roadmap.
