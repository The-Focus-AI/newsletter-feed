Entry-level hiring at major technology companies has collapsed by more than fifty percent since 2019, according to SignalFire’s analysis of new grad hiring at large tech firms. Globally, entry-level job postings—roles requiring zero to two years of experience—declined sharply through 2024 and into 2025, per Randstad data reported by the World Economic Forum. The unemployment rate for recent college graduates sits at 5.3 percent as of Q3 2025—above the 4.4 percent overall unemployment rate reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in December 2025, according to New York Fed and BLS data.
This isn’t a temporary hiring freeze. It’s a fundamental restructuring of how careers work.
The routine tasks that once trained newcomers—summarizing meetings, cleaning data, drafting memos, processing information—are precisely the tasks that generative AI handles with increasing competence. Entry-level jobs today require experience that entry-level roles no longer supply. AI has cannibalized the low-risk work that used to teach people how to operate in complex organizations. Without those task rungs, the traditional career ladder is being disassembled while people are still standing on it.
So what do you do when the ladder disappears?
The answer is high agency. Not ordinary high agency—the kind that was always useful, always correlated with success. I mean off-the-charts, paradigm-altering high agency. The distinction matters now in ways it never has before, because AI is imposing a forcing function on the degree of agency you possess. The gap that once took twenty years to emerge now opens in months.
Here’s what’s inside:
The locus of control test. A simple exercise that reveals whether you’re actually high agency or just think you are—and the four-word response that distinguishes the two.
The objections, addressed directly. Why this isn’t bootstrap ideology, how it relates to privilege, and the difference between high agency and self-blame.
Why AI changes the calculation. The research on internal locus of control is extensive, but AI has become the most powerful accelerant for agency in a generation—and I’ll show you exactly how.
The solo founder proof. From twenty-four percent of startups in 2019 to thirty-six percent in 2025, plus the specific story of how a small team built an eighty-million-dollar exit in six months with no venture funding.
The say-do ratio. The second critical component of high agency that most people get catastrophically wrong.
The people who thrive in the next decade will be those who internalize this framework—not because it’s a nice mindset to have, but because the alternative no longer produces outcomes.
