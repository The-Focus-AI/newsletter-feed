This was the week a robotaxi hit a child, a weekend coding project hit 100,000 GitHub stars, and Wall Street decided that spending $135 billion on AI infrastructure was either genius or insanity depending on which earnings call you listened to.
Strip away the noise and there’s a single thread running through all of it. AI is no longer a thing companies talk about doing. It’s a thing that happens now—in school zones, on your laptop, across factory floors where Model S sedans used to roll off the line. The abstraction layer is gone. What remains is consequence.
Here’s the thing: if you’re watching the takes, this looks like chaos. If you’re watching the capital flows, it’s coherent. The earnings divergence tells you who controls their AI destiny. The federal investigations tell you that autonomy and accountability can no longer be separated. The infrastructure deals tell you the buildout is accelerating. And the pivots—Tesla killing its flagship sedans, a weekend hack reaching 100K GitHub stars—tell you the category boundaries are collapsing.
Commitment, not capability, is the story this week. The decisions being locked in are irreversible at low cost. And most of them just happened.
Top Stories this week:
Meta and Microsoft both beat expectations; Meta’s stock jumped 10%, Microsoft’s dropped 10%—the divergence tells you everything about how the market is pricing AI control
A Waymo robotaxi struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica; NHTSA opened a formal investigation as regulatory scrutiny intensifies
Nvidia invested $2 billion in CoreWeave to accelerate 5 gigawatts of AI data center capacity by 2030; Microsoft signed a $750 million Foundry deal with Perplexity
Tesla announced it will discontinue the Model S and Model X, converting Fremont factory lines to produce one million Optimus robots per year
OpenClaw—formerly Clawdbot, then Moltbot—crossed 100,000 GitHub stars in a week, signaling explosive demand for open-source autonomous agents
Five stories. At least three will affect how you think about your roadmap.
