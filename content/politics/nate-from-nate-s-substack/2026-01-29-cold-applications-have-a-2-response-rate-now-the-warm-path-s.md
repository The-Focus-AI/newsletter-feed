For twenty years, we’ve had a specific relationship with the platforms that hold our data: we log in, we scroll, we click buttons, and we accept whatever interpretation of our information the platform chooses to show us. LinkedIn shows us a feed. Spotify shows us a playlist. Our bank shows us transactions sorted by date. We are, in effect, passive consumers of our own data, seeing only what product teams decided we should see—and never questioning whether those decisions serve our interests or theirs.
That era is ending.
The unlock is simple to state and profound in implication: you can now export your data from almost any major platform and ask your own questions of it. Not the questions the platform wants you to ask, not the questions that optimize for their engagement metrics or premium tier conversions, but your questions—the ones they’d never build a button for. This capability changes everything about how individuals relate to the platforms that have, until now, held all the analytical power.
I want to show you what this looks like in practice, not as an abstract concept but as a working system you can deploy on your own data tonight. The example is LinkedIn, because professional networks are where the stakes are highest right now, but the principle extends everywhere. Once you see the pattern, you can’t unsee it.
Here’s what’s inside:
The warm path I’d never have found. How I used my own LinkedIn data to surface a second-degree connection to a company where I had zero obvious ins—and why LinkedIn will never build this feature.
What LinkedIn won’t tell you. The specific insights they could surface tomorrow but won’t: relationship decay, reciprocity imbalances, who would actually vouch for you, and dormant conversations with built-in re-engagement hooks.
Six analyses that change how you navigate 2026. Relationship half-life, the reciprocity ledger, vouch scores, resurrection opportunities, network archetypes, and dynamic warm path discovery—each mapped to a concrete job-search action.
Cowork vs. ChatGPT for this work. Why folder-level access and persistent state matter, plus lightweight prompts designed for ChatGPT’s constraints.
A quick guides, prompts, and a sample dashboard template. Everything you need to run this analysis on your own data tonight.
