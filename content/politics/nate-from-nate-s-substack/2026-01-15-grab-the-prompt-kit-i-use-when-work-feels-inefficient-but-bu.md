The one constant right now is chaos. I hear it over and over again from people trying to make sense of AI—the rate of change is so disorienting that it’s become difficult to tell what’s up and what’s down anymore. Tools that seemed essential six months ago are already being replaced. Strategies that worked last quarter feel obsolete. Everyone is busy, but nobody is confident they’re busy doing the right things.
I want to offer a simplifier. Not another framework, but an underlying explanation for why everything feels so destabilized.
Every organization, and every individual’s work habits, are built around an implicit answer to one question: what’s expensive here?
For most of our careers, the answer was execution. Building things required scarce hours from scarce people with scarce skills. So we evolved elaborate rituals to protect that capacity—planning processes, approval gates, PRDs, alignment meetings. This made sense when the meeting to discuss a feature took less time than building it—you hold the meeting. When writing a spec cost less than writing the code, you wrote the spec first. When rework was expensive, you planned carefully to avoid it.
Even Agile, which was supposed to make us more nimble, still assumed that engineering was expensive. It was a more intelligent way to manage expensive execution over time—shorter cycles, faster feedback, less wasted work—but the underlying assumption remained that the doing was costly and needed to be protected.
AI inverted this completely.
Cursor went from one million to five hundred million in annual revenue faster than any SaaS company in history. Michael Truell, their CEO, talks about “taste” becoming more valuable than technical ability—the capacity to know what’s worth making rather than just the capacity to make it. They’re not building a tool that helps engineers code faster; they’re building a tool that makes the act of coding less important than the judgment about what to build.
Now the meeting takes longer than building the prototype. The PRD takes longer than shipping a working version. The alignment process takes longer than trying three approaches and seeing which one users actually want.
Here’s what’s inside:
What’s actually scarce now. Clarity, ambition, distribution, relationships—the four things that got expensive when execution got cheap. Most people are still protecting the wrong resource.
The habits that don’t make sense anymore. Permission loops, polish as hiding, meetings as accountability theater—and the rest of the old rituals we’re still running.
How to start without getting fired. Small, reversible experiments you can run this week to match your pace to the new economics.
The bottleneck didn’t disappear. It moved.
