Amazon isn’t cutting 30,000 jobs because they have too many managers.
They’re cutting 30,000 jobs because they need the money to buy GPUs.
That’s the story nobody wants to tell you. Not Andy Jassy on the earnings call. Not the business press dutifully repeating the “culture” narrative. Not the analysts who’d rather talk about AWS growth rates than the brutal arithmetic reshaping Big Tech from the inside out.
When Amazon cut 14,000 people in October, I argued the real story was capital reallocation —freeing cash to fund the AI infrastructure race, not robots replacing workers. The second wave, 16,000 more this week, makes the pattern undeniable. And now we have the numbers to prove it.
Here’s what actually happened: Amazon’s quarterly free cash flow went negative—negative $4.8 billion—at the exact moment their capital expenditure hit $125 billion, the highest of any company on Earth, with 75% of it going directly to AI infrastructure. They raised $12 billion in debt this year to fund data centers. And then they eliminated 10% of their white-collar workforce.
This isn’t a layoff. It’s a capital reallocation. Human headcount converted to compute capacity. Salaries transformed into silicon.
And if you understand why Amazon is making this trade, you understand something important about what’s coming for the entire technology industry.
