Denis Balibouse/Reuters 
Denis Balibouse/ReutersAfter President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney traded rhetorical blows at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, congressional Republicans had a clear message for their neighbors to the North: Just ignore it, [Semafor’s Eleanor Mueller reports](https://semafor.com/s/pHxwghxyiQ?email=wschenk@gmail.com). “Our relationship is inseparable — and we may have disagreement, but again, the people of Canada and the people of the United States have so much in common, it’s an understatement,” said Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C. “So this is just a blip.” Carney, who earned a standing ovation Tuesday for his self-written warning that “the rules-based order is fading,” did not mention Trump by name. But the president hit back Wednesday, chiding Carney to “remember” that “Canada lives because of us.” “Stylistically, there’s things that I’ve disagreed with.,” Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., said. “We need to show strength but also be diplomatic.”

↓↓22Relief as Trump eases on Greenland

 
US markets breathed a sigh of relief after Trump announced he’d reached a “framework of a future deal” regarding Greenland and would drop tariff threats on Europe. The announcement followed a fiery speech in Davos during which Trump took aim at European leaders but also backed off using military force to wrest control of Greenland. Many questions remain unanswered about the framework, which Trump announced following a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte: Asked whether the agreement includes US ownership of Greenland Trump didn’t directly answer, instead describing it as “the ultimate long-term deal.” Bloomberg reported Rutte as saying that the talks focused on security and that [sovereignty](https://semafor.com/s/NaGIfnqOuh?email=wschenk@gmail.com) had not been discussed. Trump has tapped officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance to lead negotiations. The transatlantic relationship faces another test today as Trump meets with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy.— Shelby Talcott

Denis Balibouse/Reuters 
Denis Balibouse/ReutersAmerica’s global leadership is “in dormancy” but not dead, California Governor Gavin Newsom told Semafor’s Ben Smith at the World Economic Forum Thursday. Newsom called Trump an “[invasive species](https://semafor.com/s/cQ9N8kzeiU?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” defined by “corruption and graft at a scale we’ve never seen in American history,” but rejected the prevailing Davos [view](https://semafor.com/s/YcnEVsbByb?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that he represents a historic rupture. Newsom also defended his strategy of mirroring the “deeply unbecoming” personal insults Trump and his aides lob at enemies, waving red kneepads on subservient American leaders, and arguing that style is simply the only way to counter Trump: “I was doing my 10 point plans before — and I don’t think any of you would’ve been here this morning had I done that,” he said.

Trump himself is [controlling the release of funds](https://semafor.com/s/2Q9vOnRYzh?email=wschenk@gmail.com) garnered from Venezuela, an administration official told Semafor, in another sign of the leverage he wields over the country. Semafor first [reported](https://semafor.com/s/vMCBHthKs2?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that the Trump administration had completed its first oil sale, valued at $500 million, and that many of the funds are being held in Qatar. Interim president Delcy Rodríguez [revealed](https://semafor.com/s/ZPpNOYiriH?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that $300 million of those funds were released to Venezuela this week. The Trump administration official told Semafor that all of the funds from the first sale will be given to Venezuela because its current government has “fully cooperated” with the US. But it’s unclear whether any of the funds will be held in the US; the official told Semafor proceeds from sales “will first settle in US controlled accounts at globally recognized banks.”— Shelby Talcott

↓↓55SCOTUS unlikely to back Cook’s firing

 
Nathan Howard/Reuters 
Nathan Howard/ReutersTrump’s effort to exert more control over the Federal Reserve is hitting roadblocks. The Supreme Court seems unlikely to back the president’s attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, after several members of the conservative majority sharply questioned the move during Wednesday’s oral arguments. If there were a “[low bar for cause](https://semafor.com/s/NWDnLmA1WU?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” in firing officials like Cook, “that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,” said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee. Even conservative Justice Samuel Alito sounded skeptical of the “hurried manner” of the litigation. “At times … the justices seemed to be debating how to rule in Cook’s favor, rather than whether to do so,” [Politico reported](https://semafor.com/s/rWK9lLOWci?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The ruling expected later this year carries implications not only for Cook but for broader Fed independence, as Trump turns his sights to outgoing Chair Jerome Powell.

Susan Collins, R-Maine. Conservative group One Nation is launching a massive $5.5 million ad buy lauding Collins, starting Thursday and running into the spring, according to details first shared with Semafor. The first [ad](https://semafor.com/s/Wus2oqoc7p?email=wschenk@gmail.com) focuses on how Collins secured money for Maine’s water infrastructure, a nod to her chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The investment will eventually eclipse eight figures and Alex Latcham, the group’s executive director, said it “will continue to educate Maine about Senator Collins’ unmatched record.” It’s in addition to a $42 million [investment](https://semafor.com/s/Z3uJlsa8kt?email=wschenk@gmail.com) supporting Collins from Senate Leadership Fund, a sister group to One Nation. Collins, who has recently drawn Trump’s ire, will face the winner of the Democratic primary between Gov. Janet Mills and Graham Platner.— Burgess Everett

Chuck Cook/USA TODAY Sports.Senate Democrats are contesting [four GOP-held seats](https://semafor.com/s/cJicV5wc81?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that give them a potential [path](https://semafor.com/s/F1tpDBwkcn?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to the majority. They also need to hang onto all the seats they currently hold. By landing former broadcaster Michele Tafoya in Minnesota, Republicans have their target list: Minnesota, Georgia, Michigan, and New Hampshire. The Senate GOP’s campaign arm [argues](https://semafor.com/s/A5dEJ8wbeO?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in a new memo that the Minnesota fraud scandal makes it a “strong opportunity for Republicans to expand” their margin of control. Minnesota remains a reach for Republicans, though there are tough Democratic primaries there and in Michigan. “They’re all going to stay Democratic,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told us of the Democratic seats. He said rising costs and unrest in the auto industry would hurt Republicans in Michigan and that Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff is going to “win by more than people think.”— Burgess Everett

DNC chair Ken Martin plans to fly to the global tech center for a series of “salon-style” discussions with the industry and workshops aimed at making the Democratic Party’s technology better. The DNC’s get-out-the-vote operation was nearly crippled in the summer leading up to the 2024 presidential election, when the massive voter database, run by a PE-backed company, almost collapsed, [according to The New York Times](https://semafor.com/s/UeOPqCmVzN?email=wschenk@gmail.com); Democrats resorted to pen and paper to keep the operation afloat. Martin will be joined by DNC Chief Technology Officer Arthur Thompson in a bid to shore up the party’s tech infrastructure, which the DNC said is a major priority for the party.
