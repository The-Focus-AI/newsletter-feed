Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters.Senate Democrats are [lining up](https://semafor.com/s/vxLU3w0Vmu?email=wschenk@gmail.com) against the Department of Homeland Security funding measure, decrying a bill that “allows ICE to keep terrorizing our communities,” as Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., put it. The bill passed the House with just seven Democratic votes on Thursday. On its own, the DHS bill might fail in the Senate next week. But there’s a twist: It may ultimately pass because it’s rolled into five other House-passed spending bills that Democrats generally support. Senate Democrats will need to put up seven or more votes to break a filibuster next week and avoid a broader shutdown on Jan. 30. That drama follows Thursday’s wobbly House action, which included a last-minute rebellion over ethanol sales that ended in what Rep. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, called a “firm commitment” for heartlanders to sit down with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.— Burgess Everett and Eleanor Mueller

↓↓22White House targets ICE protesters

 
Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters 
Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersAs Congress chooses a path forward on DHS funding, the White House is trying to turn up the pressure in Minneapolis. Federal authorities arrested [three people involved](https://semafor.com/s/txUEhKlFav?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in an ICE protest at a Minnesota church over the weekend, but [failed to bring charges](https://semafor.com/s/JsbUsSw2v1?email=wschenk@gmail.com) against former CNN anchor Don Lemon for attending. A magistrate judge’s rejection of the charges against Lemon “[enraged](https://semafor.com/s/A6EyqlMFHf?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” Attorney General Pam Bondi, CNN reported. Vice President JD Vance was in Minneapolis Thursday, urging local officials to support federal immigration authorities as the Trump administration continues its crackdown. Vance called the [pattern of violent incidents](https://semafor.com/s/tfz37zJlae?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in Minneapolis “the inevitable consequence of a state and local government that have decided that they’re not going to cooperate with immigration enforcement at all.” At the same time, he made clear Trump [isn’t](https://semafor.com/s/9A8HkYL2OC?email=wschenk@gmail.com) planning to use the Insurrection Act against the city — for now.

↓↓Semafor Exclusive33US, China sign off on TikTok deal

 
The US and China have signed off on a deal to sell TikTok’s US business to a consortium of mostly US investors led by Oracle and Silver Lake, the companies confirmed Thursday night, capping a years-long battle between the social media app and the two superpowers. The deal — outlined by the chief executive of TikTok parent ByteDance in an internal memo last month, and first reported by [Liz Hoffman and Reed Albergotti](https://semafor.com/s/lo3TjiOCe3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — is set to close this week. That would resolve an on-again, off-again conflict in US-China relations at a time when tensions remain high. Trump is set to meet with Chinese Leader Xi Jinping in Beijing in April. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Politico the bilateral relationship has reached a “[very good equilibrium](https://semafor.com/s/jQ8rZDRaQq?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” a sign an offramp is possible despite Trump’s inconsistent rhetoric on China.

↓↓44Sticky inflation makes Fed cut unlikely

 
The Federal Reserve is [expected to leave interest rates alone](https://semafor.com/s/pCULcn58Ak?email=wschenk@gmail.com) next week after receiving confirmation that inflation is still elevated (and that the job market remains steady). The Commerce Department reported Thursday that inflation ticked up to 2.8% in November while the Labor Department said new jobless claims were similarly little changed last week. In another sign of economic resilience, the Commerce Department also said that GDP increased in the third quarter of 2025 at its fastest pace in two years. The Trump administration will gain some additional insight into how its economic agenda is playing with Americans when the University of Michigan releases its January consumer sentiment survey this morning. With interviews that ran through Monday, it should provide a preliminary look at how the president’s recent rollout [of affordability measures](https://semafor.com/s/srFje4Rf7I?email=wschenk@gmail.com) has been hitting (though not [the market fallout](https://semafor.com/s/pR1p20ATPX?email=wschenk@gmail.com) from Greenland).— Eleanor Mueller

Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen. Yves Herman/Reuters.European officials may be relieved that Trump is stepping back from his Greenland threats, but they’re also on edge wondering what’s next. Greenland’s leaders [weren’t consulted](https://semafor.com/s/BEzrNAS1eJ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) on the “framework” Trump said was agreed to in Davos, with one official telling The Wall Street Journal they aren’t “familiar” with it. Bloomberg reported the deal would involve [NATO bolstering security](https://semafor.com/s/mSLO0vWzgd?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in the Arctic and cover mining rights and the stationing of US missiles in the Danish territory. European officials, including the Danish prime minister, emphasized that the island’s sovereignty is not on the table. Still, Trump told Fox News that the deal being negotiated would give the US “[total access](https://semafor.com/s/EMrsDtWPc7?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” to Greenland, including the ability to place a “piece” of the Golden Dome there; he also didn’t expressly deny the US would “acquire” it, a remark sure to trigger nerves in the Danish territory.

↓↓66Trump renews push to end Ukraine war

 
Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via Reuters 
Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via ReutersThere’s renewed optimism among Trump administration officials regarding the president’s bid to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Davos for roughly an hour — both world leaders described the sit-down as “good” and announced that framework documents to end the war are [almost](https://semafor.com/s/z5FQVJr5o2?email=wschenk@gmail.com) complete. “We are at the end now,” Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said. He jetted off to Moscow yesterday and, alongside Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, [sat](https://semafor.com/s/Ajhkc9gkoL?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin before traveling to Abu Dhabi for more peace plan meetings. Earlier on Thursday, Witkoff said there was “one issue” remaining. Even so, Zelenskyy is ramping up the pressure on Europe, [urging](https://semafor.com/s/qG6GlEzROZ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) the continent to do more to defend itself in a blistering Davos speech. And there are many in Washington who are highly skeptical Putin will agree to a deal.— Shelby Talcott

↓↓ViewsViewsDebatable: Trump’s Golden Dome

 
As he pushes for greater US control of Greenland, Trump has repeatedly emphasized his plans for a missile defense shield known as the Golden Dome. Set in motion by an executive last year, the Golden Dome is billed by proponents as a way to better guard the US homeland against fast-evolving missile threats from the likes of China and Russia. “It’s deterrence because of technological superiority,” Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., [told Semafor’s Morgan Chalfant](https://semafor.com/s/xZHXsREjgD?email=wschenk@gmail.com). But critics say the costly project — some analysts put its price tag at as much as $1 trillion — could also trigger an arms race, rather than deter adversarial behavior. “Golden Dome will make nuclear war more likely, not less,” said Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass.

The co-creator of Freakonomics and host of one of podcasting’s most enduring shows joins Ben and Max to talk about why he never sold to Spotify, how The New York Times shifted from telling readers things to telling them what to think, and his new self-funded TV experiment that’s “like laundering podcast money.” Along the way, Dubner explains how he accidentally got sucked into the Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni gossip vortex (Candace Owens was involved), makes the case for prediction markets over pundits, and reveals why he’s now considering buying a pizza place with a Michelin-starred chef.Listen to the latest Mixed Signals now.
