Kevin Lamarque/ReutersFederal prosecutors in DC are [investigating](https://semafor.com/s/zwtkTZAnUk?email=wschenk@gmail.com) Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over his June testimony on the ongoing renovation of the central bank’s headquarters, Powell said Sunday. In an [uncharacteristically blunt statement](https://semafor.com/s/m4IrOYJsby?email=wschenk@gmail.com), Powell linked the probe to the Fed setting interest rates independently “rather than following the preferences of the president.” He added that “this is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.” The dramatic escalation of President Donald Trump’s ongoing campaign to pressure the central bank over rates is already pressing some swing votes for the next Fed chair nominee: Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said [in a statement](https://semafor.com/s/XsL0xFpAX1?email=wschenk@gmail.com) he would withhold votes from any Fed pick “until this legal matter is fully resolved.”

↓↓22Friction for Trump’s affordability agenda

 
Trump’s newest proposals to tackle Americans’ anxiety about the cost of living are already [proving difficult to enact](https://semafor.com/s/zT5bghX1i4?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The president last week announced a pair of economic policies — banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes and capping credit card interest rates at 10% — that track closer to the GOP’s populist fringe than to its free-market core. But it’s highly likely that both will require Congress to pass legislation; that’s shaping up to be a heavy lift for both chambers, especially as private-sector heavyweights like Wall Street line up in opposition. “We were blindsided by it,” Rep. Ann Wagner, the Missouri Republican who chairs the House Financial Services Committee’s capital markets panel, said of the housing proposal. Tillis went further: “No,” he said when asked if it was a good idea.

Screenshots of social media via ReutersTrump is weighing military options against Iran amid the country’s deadly crackdown on protests, and is expected to be briefed by top officials Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal [reported](https://semafor.com/s/NV9jajKw4j?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The president [told reporters Sunday night](https://semafor.com/s/cdzHDvGllD?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that the Iranians “want to negotiate” and that a meeting is in the works, but that “very strong” US actions are also on the table. [Reports](https://semafor.com/s/nVvtDyIIY3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) suggest more than 500 people have been killed and thousands detained; Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf [threatened](https://semafor.com/s/yNb3qx3wac?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to target Israel or US military bases should Trump choose military action. It’s already triggering fresh debate in Washington about war powers. “Bombing is not the answer,” Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., [said](https://semafor.com/s/LJNlD2VZ9C?email=wschenk@gmail.com) on ABC, arguing it could cause Iranians to “rally around their own flag.” Iran “should take Trump’s warning literally” in the wake of Venezuela, former Trump envoy Jason Greenblatt [argues](https://semafor.com/s/zrrDHHSbNw?email=wschenk@gmail.com).— Shelby Talcott

↓↓44Trump’s Venezuela oil dilemma

 
Oil is front and center in the Trump administration’s dilemma on Venezuela. Trump declared a national emergency late Friday aimed at preventing the seizure of Venezuelan oil revenue held by the government. That came after top oil executives signaled reluctance to invest in the country during a meeting with Trump late last week. Trump is also turning an eye to Cuba. On Sunday, he said the US would cut off Venezuelan “oil and money” to the country, and warned that they should “make a deal.” Meanwhile, Venezuela opposition leader María Corina Machado is moving forward with her effort to regain Trump’s confidence: She is expected to meet the president at the White House this week, though the exact timing has not yet been finalized.— Shelby Talcott

↓↓55Decisive week looms for shutdown, ACA

 
Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters 
Elizabeth Frantz/ReutersThe clock is [ticking down](https://semafor.com/s/DxVKn0rJKQ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) as lawmakers scramble to avoid a government shutdown and determine whether to extend the expired Affordable Care Act subsidies. The recent House passage of a three-year subsidies extension puts pressure on Senate negotiators to seal the deal soon so it could be ready to potentially attach to a must-pass bill (like government funding). But the Senate’s decision to advance a resolution limiting Trump’s military options in Venezuela could delay an effort to approve a package of three spending bills. After this week, the Senate will go on recess for a week, with the House set to follow at the end of the month — leaving little time for cross-chamber coordination. And Democrats’ rising anger over last week’s ICE shooting could further impact the funding fight ahead of the Jan. 30 deadline.— Burgess Everett

Harriet Hageman/Handout via ReutersIf the race to be the next senator from Wyoming wasn’t over already, [it is now](https://semafor.com/s/0zC5mlJ2Cg?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., is endorsing Rep. Harriet Hageman to succeed retiring Sen. Cynthia Lummis, according to details first shared with Semafor. In a [video endorsement](https://semafor.com/s/KZ2EL6ea1t?email=wschenk@gmail.com) set to be released this morning, Barrasso says Hageman’s been “critical” to cutting regulations and taxes, increasing Wyoming energy production, and boosting rural health care funding. Trump has already endorsed Hageman, and Barrasso said she’ll be “a leader that you can trust to advance President Trump’s America First agenda” in the Senate. Hageman’s ascension is part of the domino effect from former Rep. Liz Cheney’s hard turn against Trump after Jan. 6; Hageman’s defeat of Cheney in 2022 put her in pole position for the next Senate seat.— Burgess Everett

↓↓77No. of US independents hits record

 
The share of American adults who identify as political independents hit a [record high](https://semafor.com/s/dffYmGna5Q?email=wschenk@gmail.com) of 45% last year, according to Gallup [polling](https://semafor.com/s/0X7fanqYpj?email=wschenk@gmail.com) released today, even as political polarization intensifies across the US. The increase over the past high of 43%, recorded in 2014, 2023, and 2024, was partially driven by younger Americans increasingly identifying as independent (56% of Gen Z adults describe themselves that way, according to the poll). In a year where Republicans controlled the White House and Congress, Democrats held an eight-point edge over Republicans in party identification and leaning — a reversal from 2024 that could buoy the minority party’s hopes ahead of the midterms. While independents have been the largest political group most years Gallup asked the question, the data nevertheless suggests that more Americans are tiring of both political parties.

↓↓Washington ViewWashington View 
Trump, somewhere between his seizure of the Kennedy Center and his assault on the Fed, recently considered adding another independent government body to his collection: the United States Semiquincentennial Commission, which is charged with celebrating America’s birthday this summer.The takeover would have made Trumpian sense. The 250th anniversary festivities (semiquincentennial is half of 500, in case you don’t see that word a lot) are a presidential preoccupation and a major channel for corporate fundraising. The bipartisan commission was established under President Barack Obama. It’s led by figures from a lost age of American politics, and reflects a different ideological and aesthetic spirit than Trump’s. And MAGA figures on social media were [calling](https://semafor.com/s/98aGx0Byil?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for the head of its chairwoman. Trump suggested to aides before Thanksgiving that he’d replace the chair with his longtime adviser Kellyanne Conway, two Republicans familiar with those conversations said. But the president demurred.
