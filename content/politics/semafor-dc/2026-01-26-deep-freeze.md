Annabelle Gordon/Reuters 
Annabelle Gordon/ReutersThe Democratic rebellion against a bill funding the Department of Homeland Security is [setting up a challenging week](https://semafor.com/s/xE5U8G4w4L?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that’s on course to end in a partial government shutdown absent a surprise deal. Senate Democrats are already vowing to tank a six-bill funding package if it includes a DHS bill with billions for ICE, following a second fatal shooting in Minnesota. The shutdown deadline is Friday evening, and the House would have to return if the bill is changed. A Senate Democratic leadership aide told Semafor that Democrats are in contact with the White House but “realistic solutions” aren’t yet on the table. Senate Republicans plan to move forward with the funding bills, including DHS, “and hope Democrats can find a path forward to join us,” a GOP aide said. The solution, they believe, is for Democrats to support the bipartisan package they just negotiated.— Burgess Everett

↓↓22Some Republicans challenge Trump on Minnesota

 
Shannon Stapleton/Reuters 
Shannon Stapleton/ReutersPresident Donald Trump faces growing pressure from business leaders — and members of his own party — to turn down the temperature in Minneapolis following the killing of Alex Pretti. A few Republicans publicly questioned the Trump administration’s actions: Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., called the events “[incredibly disturbing](https://semafor.com/s/Epe1KTl8y6?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” and Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., demanded a “[prioritized, transparent investigation](https://semafor.com/s/C2Wq3p88wN?email=wschenk@gmail.com).” The bipartisan National Governors Association called on federal officials to [cooperate](https://semafor.com/s/xiZHyn9UbM?email=wschenk@gmail.com) with state and local authorities. And some [House Republicans](https://semafor.com/s/OgjbykrLKB?email=wschenk@gmail.com) are demanding [more oversight](https://semafor.com/s/PxXI430RJg?email=wschenk@gmail.com) following the shooting, video of which [contradicted](https://semafor.com/s/jaX4qZHw8H?email=wschenk@gmail.com) federal officials’ account. Meanwhile, CEOs from companies headquartered in Minnesota — like 3M, Best Buy, Cargill, General Mills, Target, and UnitedHealth Group — [signed an open letter calling](https://semafor.com/s/znM9XYwS8F?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for “peace and focused cooperation.” Asked about the shooting Sunday night, [Trump told The Wall Street Journal](https://semafor.com/s/uZ0rOgl1Lb?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that “we’re reviewing everything” and said agents could leave Minneapolis “at some point.”

↓↓33Doubts over Venezuela disbursements

 
Marco Bello/Reuters 
Marco Bello/ReutersFlorida Republicans worry that Caracas’ current leadership will circumvent Washington’s efforts to spend oil proceeds on the Venezuelan people, [Semafor’s Eleanor Mueller and Shelby Talcott report](https://semafor.com/s/CUXjrGngse?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Trump, who plans to sell up to 50 million barrels of crude, has already sent $300 million back to the country with instructions for Secretary of State Marco Rubio to oversee it. But key GOP lawmakers worry interim President Delcy Rodríguez’s current cooperation belies a patronage system that’s changed little since Nicolás Maduro’s capture. “We know what those people do with that money,” Rep. María Salazar, R-Fla., said. “They’re not going to give it to the hospitals in Caracas.” As Rep. Carlos Giménez, R-Fla., put it: “Maybe some public servants need to be paid, maybe there’s some things that need to be bought, etc., for the people — but it’s not to put in the regime’s pocket.”

↓↓44Fed to stay course as Trump touts economy

 
The Federal Reserve is expected to buck Trump’s calls for lower interest this week after [recent economic data](https://semafor.com/s/sZ1huYsSKz?email=wschenk@gmail.com) revealed persistent inflation. Central bankers in other countries — including some who came to Chair Jerome Powell’s defense after the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into him — [are on track](https://semafor.com/s/MXwPmEK6Bq?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to follow suit. Powell’s Wednesday press conference will be his first since both the probe’s disclosure and the Supreme Court hearing on Trump’s attempt to fire Fed Gov. Lisa Cook. Meanwhile. Trump, who last week declared inflation “defeated,” will kick off [a pre-midterms blitz of domestic travel](https://semafor.com/s/q87awfRmHa?email=wschenk@gmail.com) when he delivers his own remarks on the economy in Iowa Tuesday. The president’s visit comes as he doubles down on a recent raft of [populist proposals](https://semafor.com/s/LG0s5dz65F?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that seeks to retain voters’ trust on affordability and as he nears a final decision on Powell’s replacement.— Eleanor Mueller

↓↓55US eyes another round of Ukraine war talks

 
Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters 
Valentyn Ogirenko/ReutersUS-led talks to end the war in Ukraine will extend into this week as the conflict’s fourth anniversary nears. Kyiv hailed trilateral talks between the US, Russia, and Ukraine — the first such negotiations — as “[constructive](https://semafor.com/s/SmM2TOYiw4?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” buoying US negotiators’ hopes for a deal to end a war that Trump had vowed to stop in one day. Further talks are scheduled in Abu Dhabi next [Sunday](https://semafor.com/s/K8kg4hhjFW?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that the US-Ukraine security guarantee agreement is “[100% ready](https://semafor.com/s/YBAKj4W9bE?email=wschenk@gmail.com).” One US official said they hope this next meeting will “push this deal towards its final culmination,” [Reuters reported](https://semafor.com/s/eKKrEwpuA0?email=wschenk@gmail.com). But the same sticking points around territory remain. Russia’s Vladimir Putin “continues to play the president [like a fiddle](https://semafor.com/s/hvdzGpq45V?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said on Fox, calling for the passage of secondary Russia sanctions, which she said the White House “continues to oppose.”

↓↓Semafor Exclusive66AI critic targeted for Palantir work

 
Screenshot/Think Big PAC/YouTube 
Screenshot/Think Big PAC/YouTubeNew York state Assemblyman Alex Bores issued a cease-and-desist to an AI industry super PAC for promoting a “false and defamatory” ad regarding his work at Palantir, which provides software to ICE. The ad, produced by a [Leading the Future](https://semafor.com/s/xW8bFmIRLJ?email=wschenk@gmail.com)-affiliated PAC, alleges that Bores profited from “[powering [ICE’s] deportations.](https://semafor.com/s/uF8f2rLN7Y?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” Bores, who is running to replace Rep. Jerry Nadler in New York’s 12th congressional district, told Semafor that he refused ICE-related projects while at Palantir, and departed over the company’s relationship with the agency. “This is a PAC funded by a co-founder of Palantir, putting out an ad criticizing Palantir,” Bores told Semafor. “If they are successful in lying here, then they will go to every single member of Congress and say, ‘If you try to pass real regulation of AI, we will drop $10,000,000 on your head.’”— Brendan Ruberry

↓↓Washington ViewWashington View 
When the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans ramped up last summer, I asked immigration czar Tom Homan an obvious question: Why is the federal government spending all its energy chasing individual migrants through the streets? Couldn’t the US, like other developed countries, discourage illegal work at scale by sanctioning employers? [Homan was definitive](https://semafor.com/s/KzLcwjmXFE?email=wschenk@gmail.com): That was coming. “Worksite enforcement operations are going to massively expand,” he told me in June. Now Trump’s deportation push, which has provoked high-stakes confrontations in Democrat-led cities, appears to be at its political limits after a Border Patrol agent shot a man dead in Minneapolis. And there’s little evidence that the administration has focused on reducing the demand for unauthorized workers, or that American business, large or small, will pay a price for hiring immigrants illegally.
