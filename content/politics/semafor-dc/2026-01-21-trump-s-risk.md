President Donald Trump’s threats to take over Greenland are endangering his promises to make things more affordable for Americans, [Semafor’s Eleanor Mueller reports](https://semafor.com/s/PO7aBSWiqD?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Since “Liberation Day,” investors have shrugged off what would otherwise be market-moving news, like Trump’s investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. But after Trump vowed to impose tariffs on longtime US allies that sent troops to Greenland, a Danish territory, stocks collapsed, the dollar faltered, gold shot up, and Treasury prices dropped. Trump, who on Tuesday nonetheless touted “the best stock market in history,” had previously shown interest in trying to boost consumer sentiment ahead of the midterms — including by greenlighting the purchase of $200 billion in mortgage bonds in an effort to bring long-term rates down. “He’s got a beautiful opportunity to talk about economic growth and he’s thrown it away on the stupidity of Greenland,” Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said.

↓↓22Carney warns of global ‘rupture’

 
Denis Balibouse/Reuters 
Denis Balibouse/ReutersCanada’s prime minister used an address at Davos to argue that US aggression had triggered a “rupture” in the global order, one that required middle powers to band together. While not mentioning Trump by name, Mark Carney’s speech to the World Economic Form took clear aim at the US leader. “Every day we are reminded that we live in an era of great power rivalry,” he said. “That the rules-based order is fading. That the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.” The former central bank governor, who received a standing ovation, also warned against “using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage,” comments [echoed](https://semafor.com/s/3MKcLz0Ejh?email=wschenk@gmail.com) by French President Emmanuel Macron, who cautioned that the US was seeking to “subordinate Europe” through competition. Trump appears unfazed, however: Before heading to Davos, he refused to [rule out using military force to seize Greenland](https://semafor.com/s/3VuC4u2mPC?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

Ray Dalio speaking to Semafor’s Liz Hoffman. Firebird Films/Semafor.Countries in Trump’s crosshairs have one big economic tool, according to Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio: [a lot of America’s bonds](https://semafor.com/s/TUNxZVQs3H?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The $9 trillion of US debt owned by foreign countries is an “enormous vulnerability,” Dalio told Semafor’s Liz Hoffman on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. His warning came as an executive at Denmark’s largest pension plan said it was [selling off](https://semafor.com/s/fz8GiFDoJA?email=wschenk@gmail.com) its $100 million in US Treasury bonds (a move the exec insisted wasn’t political) after Trump reiterated his Greenland demands. “You could easily imagine it could simply become unpopular to buy or hold US debt,” Dalio said. Meanwhile, an executive at PIMCO told the Financial Times that the bond giant was [pivoting from US assets](https://semafor.com/s/xtp1MuRAdj?email=wschenk@gmail.com) because of Trump’s “unpredictable” policies. Trump is expected to speak at Davos on Wednesday, though an “[electrical issue](https://semafor.com/s/tsKIc1W9Ik?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” delayed his flight from Washington.

Rubble in Gaza. Amir Cohen/Reuters.Trump’s new “Board of Peace” [faces questions](https://semafor.com/s/5PmhwTSDse?email=wschenk@gmail.com) as he descends on Davos, where he [plans to lead](https://semafor.com/s/5SzrG9ED3w?email=wschenk@gmail.com) a signing ceremony formalizing it. Topping the list of concerns from allies is the proposal for nations to pay $1 billion for a permanent board spot. While it’s unclear whether any country has agreed to pay that amount, a US official told Semafor that it isn’t a requirement for a three-year membership. More than 10 countries have [reportedly](https://semafor.com/s/VvddVOcYN5?email=wschenk@gmail.com) signed on, [including](https://semafor.com/s/RKn83NkWjl?email=wschenk@gmail.com) the UAE, Belarus, and on Tuesday night, [Israel](https://semafor.com/s/DffXDAo8om?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Still, there are questions about the board’s specific purpose: Its charter describes a broad mandate for the organization, NBC News [reported](https://semafor.com/s/77G0PXKavP?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and Trump even suggested it “might” replace the United Nations. The US official, meanwhile, said the board’s mandate is to rebuild Gaza and that any money raised “will be used directly to accomplish those efforts.”— Shelby Talcott

↓↓55SCOTUS weighs Trump’s Fed firing

 
Kevin Lamarque/Reuters 
Kevin Lamarque/ReutersThe Supreme Court will [hear oral arguments](https://semafor.com/s/ZJkUGOQPs5?email=wschenk@gmail.com) today over Trump’s effort to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, one of the highest-profile cases of a jam-packed session. Trump’s push to fire Cook over unproven mortgage fraud allegations is part of his broader assault on Fed independence, which has earned him [criticism from Republican lawmakers](https://semafor.com/s/cIGJHnPvc3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) because of its potential negative effect on the US economy. “It’s no exaggeration to say that the economic and constitutional foundations of the country are on trial in this case,” [a former Treasury adviser](https://semafor.com/s/f4CJowNjtQ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) told The Washington Post. A ruling against Cook would threaten a 90-year decision limiting presidents’ ability to fire independent agency officials. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to attend the arguments; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticized Powell’s plans on CNBC, arguing his presence would suggest an attempt to “[politicize the Fed](https://semafor.com/s/0xuW1DvUdM?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

Spencer Platt/Getty Images 
Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesThe Trump administration [fended off last-minute Democratic efforts](https://semafor.com/s/GA24g37zjO?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to include funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and to restart federal money for rail projects — including the Gateway Tunnel — in a four-bill spending package the House takes up this week, two senior administration officials told Semafor. The administration also kept out restrictions on interior immigration enforcement and federal layoffs, slashed foreign aid and preserved the ability to reorganize the Education Department. Democrats believe they got as good a deal as possible on accountability for ICE and research and health care funding. The spin war matters: If Congress is going to avoid a shutdown, each side needs to feel like they won something. The Trump officials insisted their rescissions and threats of spending impoundment motivated Congress to move, and it’s hard to argue with that.— Burgess Everett

Jonathan Ernst/ReutersRep. Julia Letlow’s challenge to Sen. Bill Cassidy in Louisiana’s GOP primary has [the map shaping up ](https://semafor.com/s/QwP8Gwfc70?email=wschenk@gmail.com)to be a little like 2010, when three sitting senators lost their primaries. This year, Cassidy is one of three senators facing major primary challengers. The group includes Sen. Ed Markey, who faces a challenge from Rep. Seth Moulton in Massachusetts’ Democratic primary, and Sen. John Cornyn, who is battling state Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt in the Texas Republican primary. It’s been a while — nine years — since an incumbent senator lost a primary. Both parties’ campaign arms are lining up for their incumbents: Trump is supporting Letlow, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee and GOP leaders are behind both Cassidy and Cornyn (Trump is neutral in Texas), while the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is backing Markey.— Burgess Everett
