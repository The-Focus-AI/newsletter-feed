↓↓11Trump’s solo economic pivot

 
As President Donald Trump doubles down on his volley of populist proposals, his administration isn’t bringing along the congressional Republicans whose help he’ll need to make them happen, [Semafor’s Eleanor Mueller and Burgess Everett report](https://semafor.com/s/DZSH9xy9yn?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The president has proposed stopping institutional investors from buying single-family homes, capping credit card interest rates at 10%, and forcing competition to lower credit card swipe fees. Top GOP lawmakers who were caught off guard by the ideas say they’re still in the dark about next steps. One told Semafor that while Trump’s plans are proof his advisers’ affordability messaging is breaking through his focus on foreign policy — later this week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy will embark on a “[Freedom Means Affordable Cars](https://semafor.com/s/ZRPvnbZEY8?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” tour, for example — that approach has been too scattershot to catch on with congressional Republicans. “There’s so much of it, it just gets kind of lost,” said another.

Kevin Lamarque/Reuters 
Kevin Lamarque/ReutersSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has a message to his haters: Check the scoreboard in November. The Democratic leader [told Semafor’s Burgess Everett](https://semafor.com/s/12Knda4XIe?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that he now has the candidates in place to retake the chamber, and audaciously predicted that his party will prevail in Maine, Michigan, Alaska, and Ohio. “The answer to these critics is to win. If we win back the Senate, that will answer every question,” Schumer said in an interview from the party’s campaign arm headquarters. Alaska’s Mary Peltola “was the last piece to the puzzle,” Schumer added. “We couldn’t have better candidates.” There are headaches ahead, though, including primaries where Schumer himself is an issue, and prevailing in states that Trump won three times won’t be easy. “Democrats get their hopes up in these red states, they pour a lot of money in, they end up losing,” said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.

↓↓33White House hosts Greenland officials

 
Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with top officials from Denmark and Greenland at the White House today as Trump ramps up his push to own the territory. It’s not clear how fruitful the chat will be for the Trump administration, which has been weighing various options to obtain Greenland — including through military force: While Vance and Rubio will focus on Trump’s goal of acquiring the Danish territory, Denmark has been clear that it is not for sale. And ahead of the meeting, Greenland’s leader made things even more explicit, [declaring](https://semafor.com/s/cVSU2oaQJb?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that they’d prefer to remain a part of Denmark rather than join the United States.— Shelby Talcott

↓↓44Trump inches closer to action on Iran

 
Tom Brenner/Reuters 
Tom Brenner/ReutersTrump is ratcheting up his threats against Iran as the regime kills more anti-government protesters. The US president urged demonstrators to continue, promising that “help is on the way” and saying he’s cancelled meetings with Iranian officials until they stop killing protesters. “If they do such a thing, we will take very strong action,” Trump later [told](https://semafor.com/s/cqlqhbRXGX?email=wschenk@gmail.com) CBS News, referring to reports that Iran plans to begin hanging protesters. It’s still unclear if, and when, Trump will decide to take military action against Iran, or what particular shape that could take — he’s been briefed on a slew of options, and administration officials held multiple meetings as he traveled to Detroit yesterday. But the president is emboldened by some of his recent military actions, and said his endgame in Iran is “to win.” Tehran’s crackdown has killed [at least 2,500](https://semafor.com/s/QoQrDursXO?email=wschenk@gmail.com), per a human rights group.— Shelby Talcott

↓↓Semafor Exclusive55Cortez Masto seeks to redirect ICE funding

 
Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters 
Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersSen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., wants to [redirect](https://semafor.com/s/TRMGN8j9Bh?email=wschenk@gmail.com) nearly $75 billion in ICE funding from the GOP’s 2025 megabill rather than defund the agency at the Jan. 30 deadline, according to a [proposal first shared with Semafor](https://semafor.com/s/z6ABbnXdzK?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Cortez Masto is proposing that $45 billion for ICE detention centers be allocated to Justice Assistant Grant programs and nearly $30 billion in enforcement money to the COPS law enforcement hiring program. “I support strong border security. We need it,” Cortez Masto told Semafor. But “this administration is not going after hardened criminals with this money. So why don’t we redirect it to those local law enforcement agencies that are really focused on keeping our community safe?” The second-term Nevada Democrat argued that the extra ICE funding is going toward hiring officers with less training, who are “inciting some of what we are seeing happening across the country.”

Courtesy of Scott HeinsThe progressive group Justice Democrats is endorsing Claire Valdez, a New York state assemblywoman and former union organizer, to replace retiring Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-N.Y., according to an [announcement shared with Semafor](https://semafor.com/s/C9aMmadp1V?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The Democratic primary for the deep-blue seat also includes Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, himself an avowed progressive — but the 36-year-old Valdez is more closely allied with New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a fellow democratic socialist. She was the sole elected official to join Mamdani’s initial campaign launch; if she prevails in the primary, Valdez would likely operate as his closest ally in Congress as Democrats search for a way forward after their 2024 defeats. “Claire’s deep roots in the labor movement are desperately needed in a Congress and Democratic Party overrun by corporate interests and billionaire greed,” Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas said in a statement.

Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters 
Elizabeth Frantz/ReutersPolitico is planning to [launch](https://semafor.com/s/OjeZjcWStX?email=wschenk@gmail.com) a paid subscription product aimed at finance and investment professionals, an implicit acknowledgement of the increasingly competitive media landscape for publications catering to elite decision-makers. On Tuesday, Politico also informed employees that the publication would cut about 3% of its 750-person global staff, a reduction that included well-known bylines like Michael Schaffer and several former top editors. While a blow to a publication that has often prided itself on financial stability, the company’s restructuring was not unexpected to close observers: Late last year, the politics and policy publication quietly offered buyouts to its video staff. Separately, the news outlet announced it is looking at a suite of new products, including tailored subscriptions for financial services companies — a sign it’s looking to compete with other outlets like Bloomberg and Punchbowl News.— Max Tani
