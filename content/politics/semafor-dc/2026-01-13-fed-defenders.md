Kevin Lamarque/ReutersThe criminal probe over Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony to Congress over the Fed’s renovation overruns is falling flat in Washington, where even Powell’s critics won’t endorse a criminal investigation, [Semafor’s Burgess Everett and Eleanor Mueller report](https://semafor.com/s/qv5ZdxL0n5?email=wschenk@gmail.com). “I don’t like the criminal probe,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., who thinks Powell should step down and has done a poor job as chair. “If we were to do an indictment on everybody that’s elusive in front of Congress, we’d have to build a couple new penitentiaries.” And there’s practical fallout, too: Sen. Thom Tillis’, R-N.C., opposition to the probe means Trump can’t confirm new Fed nominees under current rules. The US attorney for DC, Jeanine Pirro, sought to downplay the probe Monday night, [writing on X](https://semafor.com/s/h45hvun4vL?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that “none of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach.”

↓↓22Exec pans Trump’s housing policy

 
Trump’s latest policy idea for fixing the nation’s homebuilding backlog won’t work, an executive at the nation’s largest owner of single-family rental homes argued Monday. The president is seeking to ban institutional investors from buying up single-family homes, part of a multi-pronged affordability push ahead of the midterms (he’ll need congressional Republicans’ help, too). But blaming housing giants for the high cost of homeownership is an “old view,” Stephen Scherr, president of investment firm Pretium, [told Semafor’s Liz Hoffman](https://semafor.com/s/QlP02xcjEF?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Pretium buys mostly straight from developers, which reduces builders’ risk and incentivizes new projects; “rental-home investment funds arguably enable at least as much excess housing to be built as they take off the market,” Liz writes. Still, anything the industry can do to “accelerate people’s path into home ownership, we’re game to play,” Scherr said.

↓↓33Trump turns up the pressure on Iran

 
Trump is ramping up the pressure on Iran as the country continues its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests. On Monday, the US president announced immediate 25% tariffs for any country “doing business” with Iran. The move promises to be [disruptive](https://semafor.com/s/JCBeT4lPXo?email=wschenk@gmail.com): The country’s trading partners include China, the UAE, and India. Trump’s announcement carries echoes of the administration’s economic push against Venezuela; Trump started out by imposing economic sanctions on the country before ultimately striking and capturing Nicolás Maduro. Trump is expected to meet with top advisers today to discuss possible military options against Iran; the president is “[leaning toward](https://semafor.com/s/wjV6Rqf1ld?email=wschenk@gmail.com) striking Iran,” but hasn’t finally decided, Axios reported. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters airstrikes are among “many, many options” on the table but added that “diplomacy is always the first option for the president.”— Shelby Talcott

Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters 
Elizabeth Frantz/ReutersFour progressive Democratic senators are telling their colleagues to pivot quickly to economic populism, according to [details first shared with Semafor](https://semafor.com/s/BXG77v2U6J?email=wschenk@gmail.com). “Billionaires and corporate interests have captured our political system, but our party’s anemic response to the rigging of our democracy and economy in favor of the ultra-wealthy has eroded our credibility with working people,” wrote Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy, Adam Schiff, Elizabeth Warren, and Tina Smith in [a letter to their Democratic colleagues.](https://semafor.com/s/QB5w4WmQMJ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) The senators used polling from both Democratic-aligned and GOP-aligned groups to argue that “bland policy proposals” won’t work without calling out “who is getting screwed and who is doing the screwing.” They advocated for messaging that explicitly targets taxing the rich and increasing the minimum wage. Murphy told Semafor that type of populism is good policy, and “also our party’s path to victory in 2026 and beyond.”— Burgess Everett

↓↓Semafor Exclusive55SCOTUS weighs bans on trans athletes

 
The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments today on two pivotal cases regarding [restrictions on transgender athletes](https://semafor.com/s/AWcZlqYDLe?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The cases involve disputes over laws in West Virginia and Idaho that bar transgender students from competing on school sports teams that align with their gender identity. The rulings later this year will have national ramifications, with similar restrictions in place in [25 states](https://semafor.com/s/DlYKjhyssh?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and could reshape how US law defines sex discrimination. Recent decisions suggest the conservative court will rule in the states’ favor (the justices [upheld](https://semafor.com/s/bGU9lIag67?email=wschenk@gmail.com) a ban on transgender medical care for minors in Tennessee last year). West Virginia Attorney General John McCuskey told Semafor he’s “confident” in the case, though he acknowledged it’s “a daunting task to try to assume what nine of the smartest lawyers in the world are going to ask you about very far-reaching and important constitutional questions.”— Morgan Chalfant

Aaron Schwartz/ReutersThere are some 48 hours until the Senate Banking Committee marks up cryptocurrency firms’ [most-sought-after legislation](https://semafor.com/s/FeU4JN1r6K?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — and [about as many loose ends](https://semafor.com/s/WEShflaLUi?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he received bill text Monday afternoon that included an amendment proposing how to tackle stablecoin rewards, which are a holdup for some Republicans. But Rounds said he still needed to “find out what the players think,” while Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he “still [has] some concerns.” As for a bipartisan deal on ethics, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Democrats are still “proposing a ban on sponsoring, endorsing or issuing digital assets that applies to all federal employees” — likely a nonstarter for the Trump administration. Still, it’s full steam ahead: “We have just bent over backwards to accommodate the concerns that have been raised,” Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said. “So I hope we get a solid bipartisan vote.”— Eleanor Mueller
