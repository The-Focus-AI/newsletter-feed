Kevin Lamarque/Reuters 
Kevin Lamarque/ReutersPresident Donald Trump is shifting course in Minnesota after federal agents killed US citizen Alex Pretti, shaking up the immigration enforcement chain of command in the state and talking about working more with local officials, [Semafor’s Shelby Talcott and Burgess Everett report](https://semafor.com/s/6pAU6m3fPK?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Trump sent border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota; one senior White House official told Semafor that Homan will mediate between the administration and state and local officials. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino is also expected to depart Minnesota imminently, though DHS says that some agents will remain. However, it’s unclear whether Trump’s rare, if indirect, acknowledgment of problems with his aggressive border enforcement will result in successful deescalation. The shift comes as GOP lawmakers seek more oversight of the administration’s immigration operations: At least three panels chaired by Republicans are planning immigration enforcement hearings.

↓↓22Backlash builds to immigration crackdown

 
Seth Herald/Reuters 
Seth Herald/ReutersFederal immigration agents’ days in Minnesota may be numbered regardless of what Trump’s plans are. A federal judge in the state is currently weighing Minnesota’s push to block the enforcement operation, and signaled in a hearing Monday that she would [rule swiftly](https://semafor.com/s/wW3A5p655t?email=wschenk@gmail.com). [Body camera footage](https://semafor.com/s/WMyw5c5Zfq?email=wschenk@gmail.com) depicting Pretti’s killing and other evidence has reportedly been preserved, though a DHS lawyer did [not commit](https://semafor.com/s/N7Lj3K6wyl?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to sharing it with state officials. The backlash continues to build in both parties: A Republican candidate for Minnesota governor ended his campaign over the shooting of Alex Pretti, calling the crackdown “[an unmitigated disaster](https://semafor.com/s/tsErTOUZfU?email=wschenk@gmail.com).” Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., said he now [regrets](https://semafor.com/s/9n4uizEhRP?email=wschenk@gmail.com) being one of the few Democrats who voted for the DHS funding bill that cleared the House last week. Even Trump ally Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, [criticized](https://semafor.com/s/IEXZPmVyLD?email=wschenk@gmail.com) DHS’ response: “Escalating the rhetoric doesn’t help.”

↓↓33Senate moves toward shutdown vote

 
Kevin Lamarque/Reuters 
Kevin Lamarque/ReutersSenate Republicans [plan to vote](https://semafor.com/s/0Y5HhD1V7d?email=wschenk@gmail.com) on a government funding package as soon as Thursday, shrugging off Democrats’ vows to filibuster the legislation unless DHS funding is removed and amended after the two fatal Minnesota shootings. Avoiding a Jan. 31 shutdown might come down to whether the White House and Democrats agree on changes to immigration enforcement. Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., indicated there may be things the administration can do, but said the plan is to pass the House’s spending package. “The best pathway forward is to be able to pass them all this week. If we can find appropriate things within the purview of the administration where we can make that happen, that would be my goal,” Britt said. Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, hoped “everyone would realize that a government shutdown is extremely harmful and should be avoided at all costs.”— Burgess Everett

↓↓44Trump zeroes in the economy in Iowa

 
Trump will [speak in Iowa](https://semafor.com/s/xux2R7C7IV?email=wschenk@gmail.com) today to launch a multi-state tour to retain Americans’ trust on the economy ahead of the midterms. The president has tried again and again to pivot to [domestic affordability issues](https://semafor.com/s/Wf5cwBwYMy?email=wschenk@gmail.com) amid [persistent public angst](https://semafor.com/s/YQAZOOMeqH?email=wschenk@gmail.com), only to repeatedly return to foreign policy priorities like Venezuela and Greenland. Today’s trip will see him tout his administration’s progress fighting inflation and boosting economic growth, a White House official told Semafor. “Trump has always been most in his element when he’s interacting with everyday Americans,” the official said. “The president’s trip to Iowa will allow him to most effectively underscore how this administration has and continues to deliver economic prosperity for the American people, despite whatever contrived scandals the mainstream media and Democrats would rather focus on instead.”— Eleanor Mueller

↓↓Semafor Exclusive55Poll: Voters want primary election reforms

 
Large majorities of Americans in both parties [support](https://semafor.com/s/R2NVp6JDnC?email=wschenk@gmail.com) requiring states to open up congressional primaries to all voters, according to [new polling](https://semafor.com/s/O18RZPDLb1?email=wschenk@gmail.com) sponsored by Unite America and shared first with Semafor. Seven in 10 of registered voters polled in the national survey by RealClear Opinion Research want to open up primaries, while only 20% oppose doing so. Many states only allow registered partisan voters to participate in primaries, resulting in small percentages of voters choosing nominees. And in many deep red or blue districts, primaries effectively decide the general election. With that in mind, 60% of those surveyed support “top two” elections like California’s system and 62% support an Alaska-style ranked-choice “top four” election. The poll also found that 53% of respondents view US democracy as “weak,” and half of respondents disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president.— Burgess Everett

↓↓66Starmer walks tightrope in China

 
As Trump bears down on Canada for testing out rapprochement with China, another US ally is reaching out to Beijing. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is headed to China for a visit that will see him walking a tricky tightrope. He’s looking to boost ties with Beijing to rekindle Britain’s flagging economy, as Washington becomes more unpredictable on trade and foreign policy. But Starmer is [loath to antagonize the White House](https://semafor.com/s/V0t0tzr7VO?email=wschenk@gmail.com), Politico reported, and said he wouldn’t be made to “[choose](https://semafor.com/s/NDAbHEkDpJ?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” between the US and China ahead of the trip. Starmer’s outreach is complicated by his government’s intent to [heighten scrutiny of Chinese espionage](https://semafor.com/s/qU6PXGGyt1?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Several Western leaders have planned visits to China in recent months: Finland’s prime minister is there now, France’s president visited last month, and Germany’s chancellor will go in February. Trump himself intends to go in April.
