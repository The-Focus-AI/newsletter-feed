We are living in a golden age of conspiracy theories. Claims about elite pedophilic conspiracies and government knowledge of UFOs that once would have been dismissed as crankish can now be voiced in respectable company. It hasn’t been easy lately for delusional paranoids and dishonest grifters to distinguish themselves, though they have risen to the challenge with brio.  

In this climate, a controversial British policy [https://www.compactmag.com/r/ba618502?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] aimed against Freemasons in the Metropolitan police force seems downright quaint. The once formidable international fraternity has been in decline for at least a century. Its rituals, symbols and secrets inspired countless pseudo-historical potboilers, but outrage against supposed Masonic conspiracies seems almost as anachronistic as another witch craze. But the return of anti-Masonry is another sign that people have lost faith in authoritative institutions—in this case, the police.

> “Anti-Masonry is another sign that people have lost faith in authoritative institutions.”

For decades the Metropolitan police have been dogged by accusations that the Freemasons have infiltrated the police force and colluded in covering up the crimes of brotherhood. An unfortunately named 1976 bestseller, Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution, argued that the most notorious unsolved crime in British history was in fact a Masonic conspiracy. The claim was laughable. But the book was part of a broader pattern of accusing Masons of exerting a sinister influence on government and whitewashing various crimes committed by its members. 

“Many of us are gravely suspicious about the influence of Freemasonry,” Jeremy Corbyn said in 1988. “Freemasonry is incompatible with being a police officer….the power of a Masonic Lodge on any organization is sinister and insidious.” After winning power in 1997, Tony Blair’s Labour government began to implement a policy requiring all judicial appointees to disclose whether they were Freemasons. The policy faced various legal challenges, and the Labour Government eventually dropped the effort in 2009.  

The most recent anti-Mason policy marks the return of a suspicion almost as ancient as the brotherhood itself. The dark power of Masonry may seem an outdated concern. But the history of Masonry and anti-Masonry shows how reality and paranoia tend to intersect as the public loses confidence in the integrity and credibility of its leaders. 

----------------------------------------

 

Freemasons trace their own history back to Medieval stonemasons responsible for building Europe’s great cathedrals. But the modern institution first emerged and flourished in eighteenth-century Britain. The first Grand Lodge formed in London in 1717. It was a product of the Enlightenment and the British social order and empire that created the modern world.  

Freemasonry filled an obvious need in a society transitioning from aristocracy to democracy, where religious belief remained central but no longer supplied the organizing basis of all political loyalties and conflict. The rituals, symbolism, and esoteric secrets of Freemasonry provided a surrogate religious community that transcended sectarian divisions. In an increasingly mobile and fluid economic order, the fraternal brotherhood offered fictive kinships that mimicked the ties of family and church. And finally, the ethos of Masonry combined egalitarian ideals with an aura of exclusivity and elitism that appealed to aspirational social climbers. Masons were selectively recruited among the virtuous without regard to social class, creating an institutionalized network of elites based on merit rather than birth. 

The brotherhood’s commitment to secrecy amounted to an effective bonding ritual by setting them apart, a purpose reinforced by the hostile curiosity of outsiders. As one brother explained under torture by Portuguese inquisitors in 1741, the ultimate purpose of its secrets was secrecy. 

Within a few decades Masonry spread into a worldwide movement. The first lodges in British North America appeared in the 1730s. In the decades surrounding the American Revolution, membership in the fraternity exploded and the brotherhood played an important role in promoting republican values. At least thirteen framers of the Constitution were Freemasons, including the two most famous, Benjamin Franklin and George Washington. Washington called Masonry “a lodge for the virtues.” And when Franklin arrived in Paris in 1777, he immediately joined the Lodge of the Nine Sisters, where he served as Venerable Master, helped recruit Voltaire into the brotherhood—and, not least, persuaded France to aid the Patriot cause. 

The first major attack on the Freemasons came in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Reactionaries in Europe developed the theory that the French upheaval was the deliberate result of a conspiracy carried out by a network of secret societies, including Freemasons and the Bavarian Order of Illuminati. In this view, Freemasonry was not an organ of virtuous republicanism, but a sinister cabal bent on the bloody overthrow of all social institutions, including religion and property. In America, this view found favor among New England Federalists embattled by the rise of Jeffersonian democracy. 

Nevertheless, Freemasonry spread far more rapidly in America than anywhere else in the world. Between 1800 and 1825, membership more than tripled, from 25,000 to 80,000. The immense success of Freemasonry in America prompted the most formidable popular backlash against the fraternity in its history. Just thirty years after being assailed as radical levelers, American Freemasons came under attack as a secret oligarchy. The fraternity that played such a conspicuous role in the founding of the republic now served as a lightning rod for the populist discontents that fueled the rise of democratic politics. As one historian put it, “Anti-Masonry was Jacksonian Democracy…for those who could not stand Jackson.” 

> “Freemasonry spread far more rapidly in America than anywhere else in the world.”

The populist attack on Masonry followed the disappearance and alleged murder of William Morgan in September of 1826—in a coincidence that escaped no one’s notice, this was the fiftieth anniversary year of the Declaration of Independence. 

After settling in Batavia, a town in Upstate New York, Morgan was rejected by a local Mason lodge, though he claimed he was already a member. Hell hath no fury like a fraternity brother scorned. Bent on revenge, Morgan and a local printer published an expose of Masonry’s secret rituals and lore, along with promises of more revelations to come. Local officials responded by arresting Morgan for an alleged unpaid debt. Then the story took a darker turn. 

Someone paid Morgan’s debt and he was released from jail into the custody of his anonymous benefactors. As they hustled him into a carriage, Morgan shouted “Murder! Murder!” He was never seen alive again. 

No one today knows what happened to Morgan. His body was never found. It is possible his kidnappers merely convinced him to flee. A few fanatical rogues may have killed him, deliberately or accidentally. Or perhaps Morgan’s murder was the result of a planned conspiracy implicating one or more lodges. 

What is clear is that the Masons actively and brazenly shielded their own members from legal scrutiny or accountability. Sixty percent of all office holders in Batavia County were Masons. Grand juries were packed with Masons. One local sheriff served 30 months for his role in the kidnapping. But otherwise all the immense outcry and investigations brought to light was the brotherhood’s role in hiding the truth. 

Inevitably, the public’s fascination with a mysterious conspiracy will attract countless opportunists claiming to reveal all. Morgan’s scandalous disappearance summoned hordes of “mountebank anti-Mason professors of Masonry,” as one journalist complained. 

The moral crusade against Masonry quickly swelled into a major political movement. It helped advance a broader revolt against the leadership of traditional elites, and championed democratic reforms like abolishing property requirements for the vote. Anti-Masonry became the first third party in American history, and the first political party to use a national convention to select a presidential candidate, an important innovation in democratizing high politics. 

It is a measure of how pervasive Masonry had become among political elites that even in the immediate wake of the anti-Mason controversy, both major party presidential candidates, Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay, were Grand Masters of their local lodges. Even the Anti-Mason Party’s chosen candidate, William Wirt, was a former Mason. Freemason membership plummeted by over two-thirds over the next few years. Though the brotherhood recovered somewhat after the Civil War, it never again wielded the influence it possessed in the early American republic. 

The Anti-Masons showed that a moral crusade against real or imagined enemies of the republic could become a powerful political force. Their movement combined an idealistic effort to reform and purify the nation, the reckless hyperbole and vicious hatreds of an enraged mob, and the cynical opportunism of artful demagogues. Two of the most important organizers of the Anti-Mason Party, Thurlow Weed and William Henry Seward, also played a central role in the formation of the Republican party a generation later, another upstart political party organized against an oligarchic conspiracy—“the slavepower.” 

The Anti-Mason Party established the template for most subsequent attacks on the brotherhood, as a shadow government wielding unaccountable power for its own sinister ends, a standing conspiracy against the people and the rule of law. anti-Masonry also became emblematic of the rhetorical style that has marked democratic populism ever since—what Richard Hofstadter famously labelled “the paranoid style in American politics.”

There may have been “some truth and reality” in the anti-Mason’s grievances, Hofstadter conceded. “What must be emphasized here, however, is the apocalyptic and absolutistic framework in which this hostility was commonly expressed.” Hofstadter’s analysis of the paranoid style at times amounts to an intellectual’s lament that democratic discourse is lacking in nuance. 

Hofstadter was not alone in seeing anti-Masonry as a form of delusional populism. Yet other historians have described the same movement as a rational and salutary response to a genuine problem. That competent, professional historians have arrived at such diametrically opposed conclusions requires some explanation. 

Academic historians, in the profession’s formative years, were profoundly influenced by the rise of fascism in Europe and the Red Scare here at home. They accordingly fixated on hyperbolic depictions of subversive conspiracies as a uniquely dangerous form of mass delusion, rather than an inherent feature of mass politics. Hofstadter was careful to say that the paranoid style was “not necessarily rightwing,” but this is just a polite way of suggesting it is mostly rightwing. And American political history seemed uniquely steeped in conspiratorial rhetoric. The historian David Brion Davis suggested that the American Revolution, which began as a revolt against a plot to establish “an absolute tyranny,” may have “conditioned Americans to think of resistance to a dark subversive force as an essential ingredient in their national identity.” 

Early American political culture was unique both in the depth and intensity of ordinary citizen’s political engagement. But politics is always a contest between competing conspiracies. “When bad men combine,” Edmund Burke wrote, “the good must associate.”   

No one is in control of the blind processes that pull a society into polarized and antagonistic factions, even as those processes present real moral choices. The more polarized a society becomes, the greater the disconnect between individuals’ subjective motivations (innocent and reasonable) and others’ perception of those motivations (demented and evil). The language of conspiracy captures this subjective reality even as it fails to capture the underlying complexity of events.

C.S. Lewis opened one of his lectures, The Inner Ring, with a passage from Tolstoy’s War and Peace: “Boris now clearly understood—what he had already guessed—that side by side with the system of discipline and subordination which were laid down in the Army Regulations, there existed a different and more real system—the system which compelled a tightly laced general with a purple face to wait respectfully for his turn while a mere captain like Prince Andrey chatted with a mere second lieutenant like Boris. Boris decided at once that he would be guided not by the official system but by this other unwritten system.”

An unofficial system always coexists within the official system of networks and hierarchies. When the official system breaks down, the unofficial system is apt to seem far more sinister and powerful than it actually is. 

Freemasonry, with its long history, its ostentatious commitment to secrecy, and its extensive list of prominent members, is a natural target for such fears. But anti-Masonry is just one manifestation, among an almost infinite variety, of a breakdown in social trust. 

Two recurring and conflicting fears are endemic in any democratic republic. The first is that the official political order has become a sham, disguising how power is actually wielded by a hidden elite. The second is that some ambitious demagogue will enflame and harness the first fear, in the most spurious and lurid forms, to rule without restraint. If only one of these fears were ever valid, we would have no trouble guarding against it. But they coexist, and therein lies and old and awful dilemma.
