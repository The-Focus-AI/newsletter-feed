It should have been the perfect day to release a report diagnosing the most serious maladies facing the American family and prescribing remedies to restore it to health. After all, the very day the Heritage Foundation released its whitepaper [https://www.compactmag.com/r/74463a85?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] last week spotlighting the nation’s “precipitous drop in fertility” came news of projections [https://www.compactmag.com/r/9ce736e2?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] from the Congressional Budget Office that deaths will exceed births in America in just four years, meaning that the population will start shrinking in just 30 years. Demographic winter is here.

But because the nation’s largest conservative think tank has been mired in controversy since its president, Kevin Roberts, inexplicably made a video defending Tucker Carlson in the wake of Carlson’s interview with antisemitic influencer Nick Fuentes, the report landed with a thud. Potentially sympathetic voices have been muted, while critics from the left have denounced [https://www.compactmag.com/r/b5110ebe?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] it as racist and critics on the classically liberal right have attacked [https://www.compactmag.com/r/3a48600d?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] Heritage for embracing “Orbán-style government giveaways.” 

It’s a pity. Because there is no doubt that Heritage’s unsparing diagnosis of America’s family ills is largely correct. Marriage and fertility rates have indeed hit record lows [https://www.compactmag.com/r/be8231cf?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637], almost one-in-two children [https://www.compactmag.com/r/019e4eff?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] do not enjoy the shelter and security of a stable married home, and, now, rising numbers of young men and women tell us that key markers of adulthood long associated with family formation in the United States—marriage, a single-family home, and childbearing—are no longer attainable [https://www.compactmag.com/r/0df87156?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] or affordable [https://www.compactmag.com/r/ba0a690f?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637]. 

> “Demographic winter is here.”

This has happened for a variety of reasons. The culture has prioritized adult desires over the needs of children and families. The state has penalized work and marriage for lower-income Americans while also driving up the costs of housing, health care, and higher education through imprudent regulations. The economy has grown unfriendly to working-class men. And Big Tech is poisoning the relationship between the sexes. 

All this matters because, as the report observes, the “family is the foundation of civilization.” But there are voices on the left who continue to discount the importance of this civilizational crisis, and on the right who suggest there is nothing much government can do to address it. Matt Yglesias summed up this leftwing view years ago when he declared [https://www.compactmag.com/r/bf027f6e?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637]: “The ‘decline’ of marriage isn’t a problem.” On the right, John Shelton and Joel Griffith from Advancing American Freedom (Mike Pence’s new think tank) responded to the report with an essay [https://www.compactmag.com/r/171d6134?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] rejecting the idea that family affordability is a major challenge facing young adults and arguing that “conservatives should resist the temptation to federalize family life.” In short, there is not much that Uncle Sam can or should do to revive our civilization’s most important social institution.

If America cannot reverse the decline of family formation and childbearing, America faces economic stagnation, unprecedented fiscal crisis, rising despair, and more Caesarism from the left and the right as Americans turn to government and politics to fill the void left by the absence of family in their lives. 

While small-government proponents raise legitimate points, the government is already heavily involved in family policy. Given this fact, it makes sense to make sure it stops pushing the culture and economy in anti-family directions and instead does so in more family friendly directions. 

The Heritage report wisely offer a number of strategies that would make marriage and family life more affordable and attractive to Americans. To tackle the affordability crisis, for instance, Heritage calls on federal, state, and local governments to eliminate needless housing regulations that can make up almost a “quarter of the costs of building a new home.” Likewise, to make weekends more sane and family friendly, Heritage calls for a “uniform day of rest” that would limit commercial and alcohol sales on Sunday, thereby “restoring a common rhythm of rest and reflection [that would] foster the social habits necessary for communities [and families] to cohere and flourish.” These and many other ideas in the report are sensible and backed up by plenty of social [https://www.compactmag.com/r/bf384e53?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] science [https://www.compactmag.com/r/27955edd?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637]. 

Heritage also suggests three other moves designed to make married family life more affordable. First, is a “newborn tax credit” that would pay out $17,670 to married parents, spread out over the first four years of their child’s life. Second, is a $2,000 per child “home childcare equalization credit” that would go to married parents with kids under five that would essentially make up for another federal tax credit that only goes to families where both parents are working outside the home. Third, is a government-seeded savings accounts for newborns—similar to the “Trump accounts” in the GOP’s new tax and immigration law—that could only be redeemed tax-free by men and women marrying on or before age 30; withdrawals made after 30 would be subjected to taxes and only available after turning 59.

I’m all in favor of policies designed to make it easier to raise children at home and reward marriage, especially given the ways in which today’s economy and public policies often penalize these two family moves. We need to reinforce the financial foundations of married family life. But I think it would be prudent to extend more policy grace to adults getting married after 30 and raising kids on their own. Excluding single parents will also be a non-starter in Congress when almost half of American children spend some time outside of an intact married home. New credits and saving accounts can favor young marrieds and married parents without completely excluding those who marry after 30 or are raising children on their own. Adopting such a posture is especially urgent in a cultural moment when the new right is viewed by so many not as a force for building up a civilization of love but as bastion of hate.
