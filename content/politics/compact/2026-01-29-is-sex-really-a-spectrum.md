> Sex Is a Spectrum: The Biological Limits of the Binary
> By Agustín Fuentes
> Princeton University Press, 216 pages, $24.95

Agustín Fuentes, author of Sex Is a Spectrum, has a doctorate from one prestigious academic institution (Berkeley), a professorship at another (Princeton), and has published his book with a leading academic press (Princeton again). His book’s grave faults, then, reflect not only on the author but on a broader academic environment that has credentialed him and promoted his work.

Fuentes, an anthropologist who has extensively studied macaques, begins with a primer on the evolution of sexual reproduction in life on the planet. To show how “interesting” sex is, he offers the example of the bluehead wrasse, a fish species in which females can turn into males in given ecologies. The example, he says, is “not that weird” in biology. 

But the reality is that species like this one most definitely are weird, not only in the animal kingdom, but even among fish, who are among the most sexually fluid animals. Among fish, the number of species that are sexually fluid in this way is perhaps around 500 … unless you know that there are approximately 34,000 known fish species. In other words, even in the most sexually fluid animals, transition between male and female by one individual can happen in only 1.5 percent [https://www.compactmag.com/r/2c7f5de8?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] of the total species. What Fuentes describes as “not that weird” is certainly highly unusual.

This sleight of hand is typical of Fuentes’s handling of evidence. He attacks a classic argument in evolutionary biology that differences in male and female gametes (sperm an eggs, respectively) explain many other differences between the two sexes. In short, because eggs are much costlier to make than sperm, females have evolved to invest more energy in the reproductive chances of each gamete compared to males. This bare fact of the gamete difference means, according to the Bateman-Trivers principle, males and females typically develop different mating strategies and have different physical and behavioral profiles.

Fuentes wants to challenge this logic by changing the involved math. We should not compare one egg to one sperm, he claims, because the number of sperm required to achieve fertilization is remarkably high, given the defects present in a substantial percentage of them. One egg should be equated to about 15 million sperm, he suggests. 

But once again, he does not tell the reader essential context that invalidates his claim. Let us accept his equation of one egg to 15 million sperm. It is still the case that human males can produce that unit of even 15 million sperm much more economically than a female can produce a single egg. A female ovulates approximately 500 eggs in her reproductive lifetime, while a male can produce hundreds of millions of sperm daily, perhaps 500 billion or more in a lifetime. Even if 95 percent of those sperm are unviable for reproduction, that still leaves a male with 25 billion theoretical offspring in their gametes, compared to the 500 of females. 

There is a more or less constant effort in the book to obfuscate and mislead readers in this way. It is constantly being acknowledged that “there are…trends” along sex lines, “general sex-biology patterns that are common, even typical,” but no such thing as a reasonable classificatory system in which it is understood that males and females are generally different on some important measures. 

> “There is a more or less constant effort in the book to obfuscate and mislead readers.”

Of course, no one is claiming what Fuentes seems to believe is being claimed about the sex binary, which is that the two categories male and female are utterly separate in all measures, with no overlap whatsoever. The argument about the binary is exactly that there are trends and patterns concerning a host of variables—size, behavior, physical structures—that demonstrate males and females as perfectly reasonable and separable if not in all ways separate categories.

Fuentes notes that what he calls “3G human males and females,” that is, those individuals who are unambiguously male or female in their genitalia, their gonads (the gland/organ that produces either male or female gametes), and genes, do not make up 100 percent of human individuals. He goes on to suggest that at least 1 percent of humans, and perhaps more, do not fit the 3G categories. This is a claim unsupported by the facts. The citation he links to this claim is an article by biology and gender studies professor Anne Fausto-Sterling. The claim made by Fausto-Sterling about the percentage of those who are intersex has been thoroughly [https://www.compactmag.com/r/3703b974?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] debunked [https://www.compactmag.com/r/6bc057e6?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637]. She includes a number of conditions in her category of intersex (or non-3G) that are widely recognized as not legitimately so classified. One such condition (Late Onset Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, or LOCAH, a hormonal disorder) makes up fully 90 percent of Fausto-Sterling’s “intersex” category. Individuals with LOCAH are easily classed as either male or female according to Fuentes’ 3Gs, and nearly all of them are able to participate in reproduction as normal for their sex. The percentage of those who are actually outside 3G male or female classes is likely around 0.02% percent, which means that 9,998 out of every 10,000 humans are in those two groups.

Fuentes asserts that the idea that there are broad ways of distinguishing male and female brains and thus behavioral and personality profiles linked to those differences that hold across the sexes has been definitively disproven. One of the studies he cites in this regard, from 2015, was avidly taken up in the popular science press and presented [https://www.compactmag.com/r/0d31eb11?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] the idea of a “mosaic brain.” The argument was that male and female brains only very rarely map at one end or the other of a continuum of features typically assigned as male and female. But the methodology in the piece was called into question by other researchers. By the classificatory logic of the mosaic brain article, a hypothetical male individual who, given a range of possible leisure activities showed no interest in scrapbooking or cosmetics (both coded “female”) and was interested in boxing, construction, and golf (all coded “male”) but ambivalent about video games (also coded “male”) would have been classified as showing “substantial variability” on the male–female continuum. 

In the book’s final chapter, Fuentes wades into debates surrounding gender and sex in public policy. He attempts to argue that testosterone levels are only marginally different between the sexes and it is thus an injustice to prevent biological males who identify as females from participating in organized athletics as females. Fuentes claims that biological men seeking to compete athletically with women are a complicated case because they might have testosterone levels “in the large area of overlap between…male and…female bodies.” 

But there is no “large area of overlap.” Fuentes relies on a 2014 study funded by the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency on testosterone levels in professional athletes. This study claims to show that “16.5 percent of men had low testosterone levels, whereas 13.7 percent of women had high levels with complete overlap between the sexes.” But a closer look at the actual study data show the sleight of hand of the writers. By “low” testosterone levels for men, they mean the “lower limit of the male reference range,” which is 8.4 nanomoles per liter. “High” levels for women are determined with reference to the “upper limit of the female reference range,” 2.7 nanomoles per liter. What are described here as “low” and “high” testosterone levels in the two sexes are not determined by reference to a common standard, but by reference to the sex differentiated ranges. Almost all of the women with “high” testosterone and almost all of the men with “low” testosterone nonetheless have testosterone levels that are outside the ranges for the opposite sex. 

Fuentes also takes on the issue of biological males using female restrooms. He asserts that these individuals face physical harm if they try to use the bathroom in which they feel most comfortable. There are however compelling data to indicate why girls and women in such spaces might see the presence of biological men there as a threat. Transwomen are much more likely to exhibit behaviors of sexual violence and aggression than women. A 2011 study showed clearly that even male-to-female transsexuals who had undergone full surgical transition, and who therefore had undergone hormone therapy to try to approximate female hormonal biology, still showed rates of violent crime and sexual aggression comparable to biological males. They were almost twenty times [https://www.compactmag.com/r/d173a7a5?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] more likely to be convicted of a violent offense than the typical female subject. This is reason enough to keep individuals who have male hormonal biology out of spaces in which they interact closely with semi-clad girls and women.

The fact that Fuentes can make such ill-founded claims without fearing serious pushback is an indication of how captured academic culture is by the ideology behind this book. A healthy academic culture would not so easily acquiesce to political rhetoric masquerading as science.
