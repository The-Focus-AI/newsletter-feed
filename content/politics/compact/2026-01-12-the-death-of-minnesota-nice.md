Over the last seventeen months Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has lived the myth of Icarus. In August 2024 he became the Democratic Party nominee for Vice President of the United States. Three months later he came up just 44 Electoral College votes short of victory. Throughout 2025 Walz diligently worked the early 2028 presidential election circuit. In September he announced his run for a third gubernatorial term, hoping to become the longest-serving governor in Minnesota history. Yet on January 5, 2026, Walz unexpectedly dropped out of the governor’s race and presumably out of electoral politics altogether.

Walz’s announcement marks a remarkable fall. A September 2025 YouGov poll ranked [https://www.compactmag.com/r/704d18e2?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] Walz fourth in Democratic voters’ willingness to support for the party’s 2028 presidential nomination, higher than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Bernie Sanders. Five percent of Democrats even called Walz their “ideal choice,” a level surpassing former presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Amy Klobuchar. Walz was exceptionally busy last year keeping his name in the news and his face before activists. He spoke at the California and South Carolina Democratic Party annual conventions, held town hall events in Iowa, Nebraska, Texas, and Wisconsin, and attended a fund-raiser in Montana. He appeared on podcasts. He offered himself as the Democrats’ flag-bearer against Trump and Trumpism.

Yet it is clear now that seventy-nine-year-old Donald Trump will outlast sixty-one-year-old Tim Walz. The Minnesota governor’s political career fell victim to the follies and failings of contemporary American politics, shortcomings to which Walz himself contributed. The immediate cause of the governor’s downfall was, of course, a welfare fraud scandal that has cost the state and federal governments at least $1 billion with speculation that the tally could grow to a stunning $9 billion. That scandal highlights the central role that private nonprofits play in delivering public goods and services in America. The inability of the state government to prevent the fraud highlights the power that the NGO sector exercises [https://www.compactmag.com/r/76d10b87?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] in the contemporary Democratic Party. Yet Walz’s fall is not simply a story for the American left. It is also a tale of run-away partisanship and the cultural conquest of American politics by Walz’s nemesis. Tim Walz rose to prominence in 2024, after all, off his emulation of Donald Trump’s internet-friendly, insult-rich, profanity-laced attack-dog political style. Fighting fire with fire made Walz a beloved figure on the progressive left, but it also made him a singular target of the president and his supporters. Walz reveled in the national attention without measuring the cost of such relentless criticism, for it is precisely that white-hot spotlight which made the fraud scandal politically relevant and ended Walz’s career. 

----------------------------------------

 

The Minnesota fraud scandal was made possible by a system of interlocking government agencies and non-governmental organizations sometimes dubbed the “NGO-industrial complex.” The United States welfare system is vast, serving not only the poor but the middle class as well. Medicare and Medicaid cost over $2 trillion annually. Federal education programs clock in at nearly $270 billion while the USDA Food and Nutrition Service spends around $150 billion every year. Few of the goods and services that American residents consume through these programs come directly from government, however. They are instead delivered through a massive network of nonprofits, non-governmental agencies, civic organizations, private-public partnerships, and the like. The NGO Feeding Our Future plays the leading role in the Minnesota fraud story and understanding it helps to understand the system as a whole.

Feeding Our Future was founded in 2016 by its executive director Aimee Bock while she worked as an executive at another Minnesota NGO. Feeding Our Future existed only on paper until 2018 when Bock left her position to dedicate herself full-time to her own NGO. While dedicated to providing nutritious meals and snacks to low-income and minority children, Feeding Our Future never delivered any food itself. Its role was instead to “sponsor” on-the-ground organizations doing actual delivery, acting as an intermediary between those service organizations and the state government. The money originated primarily with the federal government in USDA food programs or shared federal-state programs like Medicaid. It then traveled through state agencies like the Minnesota Department of Education and the Minnesota Department of Human Services, and then on to “sponsors” like Feeding Our Future which finally paid the goods and service providers. Information traveled in the opposite direction. Delivery organizations such as food kitchens, delis, restaurants, and event centers reported the number of meals delivered and people fed to Feeding Our Future, which then passed the information on to state agencies who ultimately informed the federal government. That information justified the flows of money to Feeding Our Future, and those grew exponentially from an average of $61,000 per month in 2018 to a peak of $32 million in April 2021.

> “Feeding Our Future never delivered any food itself.”

State agencies had primary responsibility for exercising oversight. Feeding Our Future fought that oversight vigorously and, for a time, successfully. When the group’s exponential growth triggered suspicion at the Minnesota Department of Education, the agency instituted new procedural reforms to root out fraud. Bock in turn sued the department. When department officials declared Feeding Our Future “seriously deficient” in its financial audits and thus suspended payments, a Minnesota county judge found the state government in contempt and ordered it to pay a sanction to the nonprofit. The department felt intimidated enough to also “voluntarily” resume payments. After the Minnesota Department of Education restricted who could serve free meals to children over Summer 2021, Bock began a lobbying campaign. She met with multiple Twin Cities area politicians including a Minneapolis city council member, the mayor of Minneapolis, two state representatives, and the state attorney general. Two of those politicians, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman, even had a meeting with the Minnesota Department of Education Commissioner in May 2021 at which food program payments were discussed.

This is when the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme began to unravel The FBI began its investigation in May 2021 and raided the group’s offices in January 2022. As of late November 2025, 78 people had been charged in the investigation with over 80 percent already pleading or being found guilty. They were found to have spent the misappropriated funds on everything from cars to jewelry to vacations to aircraft to property in Africa. Feeding Our Future turned out to be only the tip of a very large iceberg. The US Attorney’s Office in the Twin Cities is currently prosecuting fraud schemes involving Minnesota’s Housing Stability Services Program, a state-specific program paid for by Medicaid. It is prosecuting fraud in autism services provided through Minnesota Health Care Programs funded by Medicaid and the state’s Health Care Access Fund. It is prosecuting fraud in home health and care services provided by Minnesota’s Integrated Community Supports Program paid with Medicaid funds. Fraud in the state’s Child Care Assistance Program funded by a federal block grant has been of concern going back to 2018, and the Trump administration has recently frozen billions of dollars in child-care money going not only to Minnesota but other states as well on the grounds of fraud concerns. Just this month, Minnesota’s legislative auditor opened a new fraud investigation front, informing the legislature of irregular reporting practices and possible graft in the state’s Behavioral Health Administration. Defrauding the Minnesota and US governments seems to have been quite easy indeed.

----------------------------------------

 

Initially Minnesota Democrats were not especially worried over the spiraling fraud scandal. The FBI handled the investigation while prosecution of cases was in the hands of the US Attorney’s Office. While fraud against state programs was the central crime, the vast majority of the stolen money came from the federal government and thus from taxpayers across the country.

Minnesota voters didn’t appear especially concerned, either. The state’s Republican Party tried to turn Feeding Our Future into a wedge issue for the upcoming November 2022 elections. Republican members of the state legislature and the Republican candidate for governor sought to leverage the first federal charges in September of that year by calling for the resignation of the education commissioner. Yet none of the state’s Democratic leadership suffered at the ballot box. Walz handily won re-election by nearly eight percentage points while Attorney General Keith Ellison actually increased his percentage of the vote over 2018. City Council member Jamal Osman, who actually founded one of the NGOs intimately involved in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme, won re-election the following year and again in 2025. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minneapolis, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and State Senator Omar Fateh of Minneapolis all received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from figures indicted in the fraud scandal, but this seemed to have few ill effects. Omar faced a strong primary challenger in 2022 but easily prevailed in both the 2022 and 2024 general elections. Fateh increased his margin of victory in his 2022 Minnesota Senate Democratic primary (the real race in Minneapolis) and together with Frey stood as the two leading candidates in the 2025 Minneapolis mayoral election.

Indeed Democrats thought so little of the potential political fallout from the fraud scandal that Kamala Harris chose Walz as her running mate in the face of it. It is not as if the story had dropped out of public view. The first Feeding Our Future fraud trial took place from April to June 2024, ending just weeks before Walz became the Democrats’ vice-presidential nominee. Despite claims in the conservative press that the Minnesota media ignored the story, local print and electronic outlets covered it extensively. It was simply that the case carried little political charge. When the first indictments were issued in September 2022, Walz insisted his administration “caught this fraud … very early” and blamed the Trump administration as well as the county judge for any failures of oversight. JD Vance didn’t mention the scandal during the vice-presidential debate in October 2024. Liberal and moderate Minnesotans interpreted the hundreds of millions of dollars in fraud as a series of unfortunate individual criminal acts that could have happened on anyone’s watch. As Walz himself said, the pandemic created “a perfect storm for fraud to occur.” Who could have foreseen it?

Everything suddenly became different after the 2024 elections. Minnesota Republicans won a razor-thin majority in the state House of Representatives, taking control of the lower chamber for the first time in eight years and ending Minnesota Democrats’ trifecta. More significantly, Tim Walz would be staying in Minnesota while Donald Trump would again be heading to Washington, DC. Both men worked strenuously to keep Walz in the national spotlight for their own purposes, and it was this spotlight that finally made the fraud scandal political.

In January 2025 Walz issued an executive order establishing a special fraud unit in the state’s Department of Public Safety. He simultaneously advanced a package of legislative reforms to increase penalties and expand the authority of the state attorney general. This was Walz’s first significant response to the scandal. Walz continued to take action throughout the year. In July his administration shut down a Medicaid-funded housing program. In October Walz announced an audit of Medicaid billing at the state Department of Human Services. In December he appointed a former FBI agent and administrative judge to serve as the state’s first “fraud czar.”

> “The more he acted against fraud, the more he brought attention to it.”

Despite—or perhaps because of—his decision to take on the state’s fraud scandal directly and personally, Walz’s popularity began to slide. The more he acted against fraud, the more he brought attention to it and to the state’s failure in preventing it. A December 2025 poll conducted by SurveyUSA [https://www.compactmag.com/r/f988962c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] found 79 percent of Minnesota voters overall and 75 percent of independents considered fraud in state programs either “a major problem” or “the biggest problem” in Minnesota. Only 14 percent thought that Walz had “done enough” to stop fraud even after his swath of actions, including just 24 percent of voters who supported him and Harris in 2024. The same poll found [https://www.compactmag.com/r/2e5fc871?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] Walz’s approval rating in the state just 6 points higher than that of Donald Trump. A Morning Consult poll [https://www.compactmag.com/r/be9b81b3?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] in October 2025 found Walz’s disapproval rating was the fourth highest of any governor in the country. A Mason-Dixon poll [https://www.compactmag.com/r/4fa98b37?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] conducted in June 2025 found Walz’s approval rating far under water in every part of the state except for Hennepin and Ramsey counties which contain the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Perhaps most worrying was the plurality of voters who said he shouldn’t run for a third term, including 51 percent of independents.

Walz’s electoral future began its nosedive in November. First, the reporter Armin Rosen published an article [https://www.compactmag.com/r/b37a0852?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] on the fraud scandal in County Highway. The conservative investigative journalists Chris Rufo and Ryan Thorpe followed it up with a piece [https://www.compactmag.com/r/930d1c75?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] at City Journal outlining the most lurid details of the several US Attorney’s Office cases. Their reporting went beyond these details, however. Citing “multiple law-enforcement sources,” Rufo and Thorpe also claimed that many of the ill-gotten funds made their way as remittances back to Somalia and into the hands of the Islamist paramilitary and designated terrorist organization Al-Shabaab. According to one of their confidential informants, “The largest funder of Al-Shabaab is the Minnesota taxpayer.” The article caught the attention of President Trump who two days later posted to his Truth Social account, “Minnesota, under Governor Waltz, is a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity. … BILLIONS of Dollars are missing.” Trump also threatened to terminate Temporary Protective Status for Somali immigrants in Minnesota, which would affect around 400 people. 

In early December the US House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform launched its own investigation into the Minnesota fraud scandal including what it called “the state’s efforts to cover it up, and retaliation against whistleblowers who sought to protect taxpayer dollars.” In late December YouTuber Nick Shirley posted his viral video of visitations to ten Somali-run day-care centers in the Twin Cities. In under a week the video was viewed nearly 140 million times. Most significantly, a day after it was released Vice President JD Vance boosted the video on X, saying “This dude has done far more useful journalism than any of the winners of the 2024 @pulitzercenter prizes.” Four days after the video’s release, Trump announced he was freezing federal childcare payments to Minnesota. Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O’Neill expressly cited the Shirley video as justification.

This unrelenting pressure from national Republicans became unbearable, and in January it cracked Walz. On the morning of January 5, he released a combative press statement announcing that, in the face of attacks on him and the people of Minnesota, he no longer believed he could “give a political campaign my all.” Accusing both state and national Republicans of political gamesmanship, cynicism, opportunism, fraudulent abuse of power, and ethnic smear campaigns, Walz insisted that “every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences. So I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.”

----------------------------------------

 

Minnesota has long enjoyed a reputation as a mild-mannered good-governance state rooted in solid Scandinavian habits. The state is famous (at least among political scientists [https://www.compactmag.com/r/1abf8ed0?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637]) as the epitome of a “moralistic’ political culture emphasizing active government, citizen participation, weak partisanship, public virtue, anti-corruption, and the pursuit of the common good. Tim Walz has long portrayed himself as a classic character of this political culture grounded in the wider social culture of the American Midwest: rugged outdoorsman, dedicated teacher, sensitive football coach, part-time soldier, full-time dad, public servant.

How could such a state and such a governor then fall victim to the country’s largest welfare fraud scandal? Because this depiction of both Minnesota and Tim Walz are only partly true. Unfortunately for Minnesota, the true part is rooted in historical legacy more than contemporary reality.

Walz believes deeply in the traditional image of Minnesota. He has repeatedly invoked the state’s “culture of generosity” and willingness to trust as the explanation of the scandal, and perhaps he is right. After all, in December the US Attorney’s Office in the Twin Cities brought charges in its first case of “fraud tourism” in Minnesota: two men living over 1000 miles away creating multiple housing services NGOs in Minnesota expressly for the “easy money” the state’s welfare system offered. Yet much of this older civic culture has been displaced by a newer progressive culture of identity, victimhood, social justice, and extreme partisanship. The ability of so many to exploit state programs is thus also rooted in this newer culture. In one Feeding Our Future lawsuit against the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE), the NGO accused the state of denying funding due to their clients’ “race, national origin, color, and religion.” When Feeding Our Future’s executive director Aimee Bock first fell under public suspicion in early 2022, she immediately played the race card, casting herself as both a personal and professional champion of Minnesota’s racial minorities and claiming the state was targeting her NGO due to its ties with “minority businesses.” Bock learned this trick from her previous executive position at the NGO Partners in Nutrition, which in 2017 sued the department of education over a similar refusal of participation in state food programs. Bock claimed that denial was also rooted in racism. The state’s legislative auditor found that Feeding Our Future’s strategy paid political dividends: “ “According to MDE officials, the threat of legal consequences and negative media attention affected MDE’s decisions about the regulatory actions it did and did not take against Feeding Our Future.”

> “Yet much of this older civic culture has been displaced by a newer progressive culture.”

This progressive guilt culture reached an embarrassing height with Ayan Abukar and her NGO Action for East African People. In 2021 the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) gave Abukar its Outstanding Refugee Award for entrepreneurship. This despite the fact that DHS had revoked her child care license two years earlier for “providing false and misleading information and failure to comply with licensing laws and rules.” In March 2023 the US Attorney’s Office formally charged Abukar in the Feeding Our Future scandal for fraudulently receiving $5.7 million from federal food programs administered by the state at precisely the time she was being recognized for excellence by the state. She has since pled guilty to those charges and awaits sentencing.

As Minnesota has changed, so has its governor. Walz began his political career representing Minnesota’s moderate Republican-leaning first congressional district, a seat he held for twelve years. During that time he maintained a center-left voting record similar to that of Tulsi Gabbard. When he first ran for governor in 2018 Walz was not the candidate of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party’s progressive wing and he did not win the party convention’s nomination. He pitched himself as a compromiser and a pragmatist with strong appeal in rural and small-town Minnesota. Yet once in office Walz took a strong left turn [https://www.compactmag.com/r/ddf02b78?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637]. He repeatedly sought to raise state taxes and did so significantly after the 2022 election produced a solidly Democratic state legislature, using that money and legislative opportunity to increase the state budget by 36 percent. Since 2023, Minnesota has no state laws of any kind limiting abortion access. It markets itself as a “sanctuary state” for not only abortion but also transgender medical treatment and illegal immigration. The state bans recreational fireworks but legalized recreational marijuana. For good measure, in 2023 Columbus Day was eliminated from the official state calendar and replaced with Indigenous People’s Day.

Tim Walz has also become a highly partisan ideologue. Unlike many Democrats, he gave no ground in his postmortem of the 2024 election. Doubling down on transgenderism in particular, Walz told the California Democratic Party Convention, “Shame on any of us who throws a trans child under the bus.” He revels in his disdain for Donald Trump as much as Trump enjoys reviling Walz. After all, Walz was the one to pioneer “weird” as the left’s adjective of choice for the 2024 Republican ticket. He mocked Trump by referring to Elon Musk as president of the United States, ridiculed Trump’s elevator snafu at the United Nations, and jeered at Trump’s “fat ankles.” He called Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers “Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo,” Elon Musk a “South African nepo baby,” and Congressional Republicans a “merry band of dipshits.” Rejecting “Minnesota nice,” he instead encouraged Democrats to “be a little meaner.” 

Trumpian name-calling and insults are strongly at odds with the political culture for which Minnesota is traditionally known, but they are consistent with Minnesota’s political culture today. Despite its “true blue” reputation, Minnesota is no one-party state like Massachusetts or Hawaii. It is highly polarized with deep partisan divides. Budget conflicts between Democrats and Republicans shut down the state government in 2005 and again in 2011. In early 2025 the state House’s Democrats walked out in order to deprive Republicans of a legislative quorum, accusing their opponents of staging a “constitutional coup.” Walz’s January 6 press conference showed how angry and divisive Minnesota politics has become. Ostensibly meant to address his dropping out of the governor’s race, Walz instead spent his time defending his own political accomplishments and attacking his political enemies. He invoked every progressive bromide: January 6, the Epstein files, ICE, people with “brown skin,” and the “trans community.” His tone was unmistakably Trumpian, simultaneously self-righteous and self-pitying. Citing federal suspension of child-care funds and the arrival of 200 ICE agents in the state, Walz skipped right past the Civil War to claim, “I don’t think any governor in history had had to fight a war against the federal government every single day.” He displayed Trumpian bravado in threatening to “ride” the state’s Republicans “like you’ve never been ridden.” He claimed to embody Minnesota just as Trump claims to embody America, speculating that he “bug[s] the crap” out of Trump because he is everything that Trump is not: honest, public-spirited, fair-minded, dedicated to compromise and camaraderie. To save Minnesota, Walz had to sacrifice himself—and so he did.

Yet through Tim Walz, both Minnesota and America have become not less Trumpian but more so. Cruder. Angrier. More combative and arrogant. In the grand sweep of Tim Walz’s career, those qualities did not help him succeed. They brought down on himself and his state the ire of the master of Trumpian style himself. At the end of his January 6 press conference, Walz offered a revealing admission: “The one thing that I hate is any time I get drug into being next to Donald Trump, God help me I don’t want to be judged against that guy.” Yet Tim Walz hasn’t been dragged into his Trumpian moment. He leapt into it. To the bitter end, Walz showed no understanding of how similar he had become to the thing he hates so much. Nietzsche’s aphorism applies: “When you look long into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you.”
