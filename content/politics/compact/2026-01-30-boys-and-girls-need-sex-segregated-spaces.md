In late December, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz announced their plan [https://www.compactmag.com/r/6082aa98?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] to block Medicaid and Medicare funding for sex-change procedures for minors. “So-called gender affirming care has inflicted lasting physical and psychological damage on vulnerable young people,” Kennedy said. “This is not medicine. It is malpractice.” Needless to say, the proposal has been met with outrage from transgender advocates and allies. Susan J. Kressly of the American Academy of Pediatrics replied that the move would “unfairly stigmatize a population of young people.”

For me, the issue of how gender-nonconforming youth should be treated is a personal one. As a boy, I preferred Barbies to G.I. Joes and tea parties to play-fighting. My parents made clear that I didn’t have to like “boy things” to still be a boy (I can only imagine how things would have turned out differently had I been born ten years later). Yet part of me wishes they had gone further. Like other boys who aren’t into sports or rough play, I inevitably found myself drawn to playing with girls. As a result, I missed out on the crucial experience of same-sex bonding, which studies [https://www.compactmag.com/r/83f913e3?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] indicate is especially important during the formative stages of childhood. 

> “I missed out on the crucial experience of same-sex bonding.”

While I never questioned whether or not I was a boy, I did question what it meant to be one. And I attribute that to the fact that I struggled to forge meaningful bonds with other boys when I was younger. After being exposed later in life to spaces where sex-segregation still exists, I found myself lamenting having grown up in an environment where it was considered a thing of the past. If my own experience is any indication, anyone invested in responding to the needs of young people who don’t fit neatly into gender categories ought to consider bringing back sex-segregated spaces.

My argument may seem counterintuitive. Progressive suspicion of male-only spaces is especially severe. They are said to be bastions of homophobia, misogyny, and other “toxic” masculine traits. Sometimes this is the case. I’ve seen with my own eyes how immature and cruel men can be toward other men who don’t fit in and in the way they speak about women in these spaces. But this is hardly a reason to swing the pendulum the other way by doing away with homosocial spaces wholesale. Critics of the excesses of sex-segregation overlook the ways that they can help outliers to navigate the complex tension between the chosen and unchosen elements of one’s identity, of conformity and individuality, and to experience the possibility of belonging and affirmation along with their uniqueness. And as Ashley Frawley recently pointed out [https://www.compactmag.com/r/12486f45?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] in these pages, intergenerational homosocial spaces provide young men the chance to learn to grow in  maturity and accountability from the presence of older men.

Alan, an openly-gay friend, recently shared with me that he’s happy he grew up in a rural environment where sex-segregation was the norm. “Sure, it would’ve been easier for me to hang out with girls. But in the long-run, I benefited from having to learn to socialize with other guys.” While he concedes that there were moments of tension, especially when it came to sharing his less stereotypically masculine interests in art and theater with other boys, he found that it was “healthier to have to learn to navigate that” rather than to fall back on the comfort of being around more readily-accepting girls. “It taught me to be a man while also being myself. I would’ve never matured and developed the confidence to be around other guys if I opted to just let myself be ‘mothered’ by women.” Having to confront his fear of alienation and earn respect from other men prevented him from the kind of “infantilization” he believes too many gay men fall into. 

I noticed a similar dynamic while teaching at an all-boys school. Boys who were ostracized for their effeminacy as freshmen learned over time to earn the respect of the other boys. While some remained stuck in their victim complex, most of them learned to stand up for themselves—either by telling off boys who poked fun at them or by “teaching them a lesson” physically. 

The other boys respected the effeminate boys who stood up for themselves and treated them as one of their own. One student, who was known for his obsession with female pop stars and penchant for wearing eyeliner, was both beloved—and feared—by his classmates. He was hilarious, but also could knock you down if you ever dared to make fun of him. One of his friends, a fullback on the football team, went as far as punching another teammate for calling his friend a faggot.

Another friend, Alicia, who is a mother of three confessed that she was conflicted when her eldest son Jonathan told her and her husband that he wanted to learn ballet. She and her husband were less worried that ballet was “too feminine”—they understood there are plenty of other cultures where dance is deemed a normal hobby for men to pursue. Rather, they were concerned that—given the fact that girls make up the majority in most American ballet classes—Jonathan would miss out on the opportunity to bond with other boys. Furthermore, they worried that dance classes wouldn’t provide him adequate space to explore his masculine impulses. 

In the end, they signed him up for ballet classes as well as for the local Boy Scouts chapter, which was known for training boys to get their hands dirty by building and repairing thing. Over time, they found Jonathan flourishing in both spaces. They are convinced that his experience with the Boy Scouts enabled him to begin to understand how ballet can also be a space for him to express his masculinity. 

Of course, there are still spaces where sex-segregation happens organically. This is the case for many of my neighbors in southern Brooklyn. It’s a common sight to find a group of Greek men—from their late teens to their late seventies—sitting outside a cafe late into the night smoking, sipping on espresso, and playing backgammon. This is even more pronounced among the neighborhood’s Muslim residents, where the sex-segregation in the mosque extends into cafes and restaurants. 

While some Americans may look on these practices as backward, there is something to be learned from them. As a sensitive boy, I got used to hanging out with girls and women who seemed more open to my temperament. I remember reaching a point during my teenage years where I realized I was ultimately not the same as them. Sure, I could engage in “girl talk”; I could fit in with them…on the surface. But there were some things about me that the girls fundamentally could not seem to comprehend. And there were certain points in conversations with them where I found myself growing exhausted, even aggravated. 

It wasn’t until I was exposed to guys who shared my interests that I began to feel understood. While I’ll never be the type of guy to go to the bar to catch a game, I came to find that hanging out with guys helped me become myself in a way that just wasn’t possible in co-ed or predominantly female spaces. Of course, not all homosocial spaces are idyllic. But we owe it to young people—especially ones who struggle to fit in with others of the same sex—to cultivate them.
