A lot of people claim that women are “hypergamous.” That is, that we prefer to “marry up” and are very reluctant to “marry down.” But in reality, I suspect that most women—like most men—want to marry someone of equal status, someone who they expect will contribute equally to their marriage. The evidence [https://www.compactmag.com/r/224fd8d8?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] for hypergamy is that women typically prefer to marry men who earn as much or more than they do. But a paycheck isn’t the only way to contribute to a marriage. What the hypergamy discourse fails to take into account is that gestation is also a valuable contribution.

Given that women can make a contribution that men cannot, it’s worth asking what real gender equality would look like. Since the ’60s, our attempts at gender equality have involved trying to ensure that women contribute and achieve as much as men do in every field, or at least every high-status field. But what is the end game here? If we perfectly achieved this kind of equality, it would require either that we treat gestation as having no value, or that we treat one sex (in this case, the male sex) as having less value than the other.

And either state of affairs would be a disaster. A society that fails to value gestation is doomed [https://www.compactmag.com/r/b6cb18ff?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637]. And a society that fails to value men is also in trouble. It’s bad for men, but it’s also bad for women, many of whom won’t be able to find a spouse who really seems like their equal. This is a serious problem, not because women are uniquely in need of a spouse, but because most people of either sex want to marry someone. This is an important personal problem, and if it happens at scale there will be massive negative externalities. If most people can’t find a spouse, it will be very hard to maintain a stable population and our society will collapse.

It’s tempting to frame this as essentially a personal problem (if you can't find a suitable spouse, don't get married!) but it's something we should all be taking seriously, whether we want to marry or not.

There are two reasons for this.

One is that marriage is important in the same way that employment is. Both things play a central role in allowing them to live a happy life, to develop and exercise their abilities, to meet their needs, and to contribute to society. We owe it to our fellow citizens—to the extent that it's possible—to make it relatively easy to find a suitable job and relatively easy to find a suitable spouse. This is a matter of justice, because these are important goods. And it’s also a matter of common sense, because if it’s too hard to find a suitable spouse, there won't be enough kids.

The other reason we should be collectively invested in this question is that our marital opportunities are heavily shaped by policy and by culture. You cannot get married by yourself; you need another person. And the policies we pursue—and what we as a society value—will directly affect what the available people are like.

Concretely, what would it look like to make marriage more available? In large part, it would involve interventions designed to unlock male forms of achievement and contribution so that men have something extra to contribute to marriages.

There are two ways we could go about this. One is economic: Put men in a better position to be breadwinners. The goal isn't that all men are breadwinners and all women are stay-at-home moms, but just that on average men have something extra to contribute. The other is cultural: allow men to do things which create specifically masculine forms of prestige.

Here are some examples of how we might do this:

In the most extreme case, we could tax male and female labor differently. (And provide men and women with different benefits.)

We could also create job opportunities specifically for men, which would improve male employment opportunities in other fields as well. The military and firefighting and police force used to (sort of) be this. We could sex-segregate them again, only admitting men going forward. If this is too difficult, we could create something new. For example, like the WPA, but designed to combat AI risk. Both via technical solutions, and via backup physical infrastructure. The point isn’t that women are incapable of doing these jobs. (Plenty of women are capable of them.) Instead, it's that we need to give men a distinctive way to contribute.

> “Another solution would be to change anti-discrimination law.”

Another solution would be to change anti-discrimination law to allow sex-segregated spaces. The goal wouldn’t be an “anything goes” approach to gender discrimination, but to give companies, schools and other organizations greater latitude in their policies about gender. Specifically, we could allow them to choose to be single-sex, gender-blind, or to preferentially hire/admit the underrepresented group. There's no guarantee that this would work, but it might. Some people benefit from working in a single-sex environment, and some teams benefit from being single-sex. Right now it is basically legal and socially acceptable for women to achieve stuff in this way, but not for men. (When I googled “all female law firm” I found a number of firms which presented themselves as self-consciously all-women; I couldn’t find anything like this for men, presumably because they would be at risk of a lawsuit.)

While some of these proposals may seem unlikely, the same was true of elements of our gender settlement we now take for granted, such as women's suffrage. Whatever course we pursue, we need to face the fact that the following three things cannot all be true: 1. gestation is valuable, 2. men and women are equal, and 3. men don't make a unique contribution. If you accept 1 and 2, we must jettison 3. The question is just which way we should go about it.
