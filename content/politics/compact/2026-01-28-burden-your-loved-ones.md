What will be the effect on a society’s understanding of human life if it comes to see hastening one’s own death as a viable response to profound suffering and diminished capacity at life’s end? This is not a hypothetical question, but one that has become pressing given the legalization of physician-assisted suicide, or Medical Aid in Dying (MAiD) [https://www.compactmag.com/r/fa60fafd?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637], in a number of US states. These include the states where the two of us teach as professors of philosophy. Soon, Illinois [https://www.compactmag.com/r/990ceed4?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] and New York [https://www.compactmag.com/r/c734d11a?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] will become the twelfth and thirteenth states to allow physicians to write lethal prescriptions for terminally ill patients. When these laws take effect, more than one in three Americans will live in a jurisdiction where assisted suicide is legal. 

Proponents of these laws, and of the practice of having medical professionals aid people in ending their lives, usually frame their arguments in the language of compassion and autonomy. They insist that patients with a terminal diagnosis should not be forced to suffer and ought to have control over the dying process. In the end, assisted suicide is supposedly about individual choice: Anyone who is against it doesn’t have to use it. 

What these arguments ignore is the way that laws that permit assisted suicide entail a profound change in how we think about human life. This change is especially significant in those cases where the “value” of a person’s life may be least obvious. And it has frightening consequences especially for the most vulnerable human beings, opening them up to dangerous possibilities for coercion and undue pressure.

The change that concerns us has been discussed before, most prominently [https://www.compactmag.com/r/2b49d49a?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] by the philosopher J. David Velleman. It has to do with whether or not a society assumes that an individual should ever need to justify his existence. Ordinarily, a person is not supposed to have an answer to the question of why he is alive and not dead. Instead, the fact of a person’s life is treated as a given, and what is open to question are other things that follow from it: for example, why one chose to marry, to have a certain career, to make one’s home in such a place, and so on. Choices like these can be justified by pointing out what makes them beneficial or appealing. But the fact of a person’s own continued existence is not supposed to need such justification.

This situation changes in a society that comes to believe that, at least in certain circumstances, a person has the viable option of ending his or her own life. When this option is on the table, a person who chooses against it will seem to need a reason for making this choice. And such reasons may be hard to come by, especially if the person is sick and frail and needs a lot of attention and medical care. Indeed, once we start thinking of things in this way it will often seem like the best thing that could happen would be for this person to die. Thinking in this way, we are conceiving of human life as something whose value needs to be justified by what a given person “brings to the table,” weighed against the cost of having them there.

> “Why should I remain alive rather than hastening my death?”

The only way to keep ourselves from thinking of human life in these terms is to refuse to ask the question that gets it started. That question, recall, was why should I remain alive rather than hastening my death? This is not a question that any person should be invited to ask, let alone be required to answer. However, when suicide is presented to suffering patients as a viable choice, when it is institutionalized in the law and the practice of medicine, it is exactly the question that they inevitably face.

It is of course burdensome to care for a sick and needy person, and frequently this burden won’t be outweighed by the pleasure of that person’s company or the happiness that one feels from having him or her around. But none of us should think that this is a reason to end such a person’s life. Instead, we need to understand that a burden like this is one we may have to bear, for as long as this person is with us, since it follows directly from the frailty and interdependence of our lives.

We must not only be willing to care for others, we must be willing to burden others. Being human means being in situations that are often burdensome to others, especially to our loved ones and at the end of our lives. There is nothing we can say that would justify this state of affairs, nor should we ever have to. Otherwise, we have taken a badly distorted view of the significance of our own lives.

Advocates for legalization often insist that there is no evidence of coercion in the states where this practice has been made legal. In making this argument, they seem to imagine only the kind of situation where a greedy individual, anxious to receive a promised inheritance, terrorizes a terminally ill relative into ending his or her life. In fact, the more relevant concern involves subtle or indirect pressure, where social and psychological forces influence what kind of medical afflictions patients will consider bearable. Such pressure follows directly from the logic that we outlined above. If a person needs a reason for continuing to live, then why shouldn’t the costliness of medical treatment, or the shortage of hospital beds, or the extent of the burden placed on loved ones, be seen as legitimate reasons for choosing an early death instead?

Proponents of assisted suicide often assume an unrealistic understanding of how human beings make difficult choices. The picture they provide is that of a person, overwhelmed by unyielding pain, thinking about whether his continued existence is worthwhile. This deliberation is pictured as if it occurs in a vacuum, independent of social or financial considerations. But that is entirely unrealistic. Even if a person’s aim in choosing to die is not to avoid the cost of prolonged end-of-life care, but only to reduce their suffering, the fact that this care would be costly is not a secret, and this is bound to make a difference to how the person deliberates. 

The assisted suicide regime that is making its way across the United States will impose a profound shift on how society views the vulnerable. The hospice and palliative care movement provides the necessary contrast. While hospice regards dying individuals as persons who are worthy of receiving the holistic care and support that they need up to the moment of their death, assisted suicide regards them merely as unnecessary burdens, or problems that can be solved by an allegedly autonomously chosen death. The suffering, the dying, and the needy deserve better than the choice to die.
