Everyone likes someone who stands up to a bully. In a dramatic speech at the World Economic Forum last week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stood up to President Donald Trump’s unprecedented bullying of America’s historical allies in his quixotic quest for what he calls “ownership” of Greenland. The Davos crowd gave him a standing ovation. 

Carney declared the present moment a “rupture,” not a transition in global cooperation. He announced Canada’s independence as a “middle power” from the “fiction” of American-led multilateralism. At the start of the speech, and in its conclusion, he invoked Soviet dissident Vaclav Havel speaking truth to power, and then he criticized “the power of the powerful”—meaning, the United States of Donald Trump. 

The cheers on my social media feeds could not have been louder. And I admit that, at first blush, I was also moved by the speech. But soon after, re-reading the transcript, I started to have my doubts.  

Anti-Trump vibes aside, what did Carney actually say? Notably, he nowhere criticized Donald Trump by name. He started his speech calling for a new frankness and an end to “lies.” But rather than the current president, it was “American hegemony” that Carney targeted. The American-led world is the “old order” now passing before us, in the wake of which Canada must declare its middle-power independence.

So what, then, were the “lies” that can no longer be tolerated? Unfortunately, the biggest lie seems to be—on Carney’s own telling—the “international rules-based order.” 

Here is the heart of indictment of American hegemony:

For decades, countries like Canada prospered under what we called the rules-based international order. We joined its institutions, we praised its principles, we benefited from its predictability. And because of that, we could pursue values-based foreign policies under its protection.

We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false, that the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient, that trade rules were enforced asymmetrically, and we knew that international law applied with varied rigor, depending on the identity of the accused or the victim.

This fiction was useful, and American hegemony in particular helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes.

So we placed the sign in the window. We participated in the rituals, and we largely avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality.

This bargain no longer works.

Stirring words aside, Carney is essentially adopting Trump’s view of the post-war world. It is not one of shared values, a liberal or democratic partnership, or a historically grounded alliance. Instead, multilateralism was a “useful” ruse, “partially false,” a “fiction” that Canada accepted in order to advance its own interests. Canada “placed the sign in the window”—here Carney invokes Havel’s description of ordinary hypocrisy under totalitarian rule—and then kept silent. But all the while, it benefited from the global public goods secured by American hegemony. The United States kept the sea lanes open, provided a security shield, and pushed for liberalized world trade. Canada played along while the going was good, but, apparently, “the bargain no longer works.” 

Carney thus sketched an abstract morality tale for a “middle power” country—in this case, his—which conforms descriptively to Trump’s transactional view of international alliances. He has simply inverted the values. Trump denounces multilateralism as a rip-off for America. (Canada has an annual trade surplus with the United States of around $50 billion.) Carney says American hegemony was a useful fiction but that the “bargain” no longer works. Isn’t this just what Trump has been saying from the other side of the border?

> “Isn’t this just what Trump has been saying from the other side of the border?”

And is this cynical analysis of post-war multilateralism really Canada’s view of the last seventy-five years? Of a world built out of shared sacrifices in World War Two? Of its historical connections with its biggest neighbor? Trump was rightly criticized for his remarks at Davos that ignored the shared sacrifices of America’s NATO allies in Afghanistan and elsewhere. But isn’t Carney doing essentially the same when he reduces post-war multilateralism to something like a game-theoretic analysis of the costs and benefits of hegemonic stability?

If Carney’s target was really Trump’s foreign policy—with its radical upending of America’s historical alliances—then Carney should have come out and said specifically that. (Enough of the lies, as he tells us.) But if Carney’s target was post-war multilateralism—and if that was just Canada’s way of prospering from American power—then Carney’s speech amounts to a confession of cynicism that I suspect is mainly his, and not widely shared in Canada.  

Carney’s analysis of the predicament of a middle power in an age of declining US hegemony is not simply “realist,” in the standard international relations lexicon. Yes, he cites Thucydides at the start of his speech, but he also calls for the construction of new international institutions and alliances among and for middling powers. But nor is it idealist: Liberal values, let alone democratic ones, play very little role in his proposed update to the global order. Indeed, just before arriving at Davos, Canada concluded new “strategic partnerships”—basically, trade and technology sharing agreements—with China [https://www.compactmag.com/r/baf6a342?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637] and Qatar [https://www.compactmag.com/r/35c9175a?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637], neither of them models of the kind of liberal-democratic virtue one would have hoped to see Carney try to advance. 

Unlike the Biden-era geopolitical push, which sought to shore up historical alliances among “like-minded” countries, based on shared principles, Carney, like Trump, implies that no such values can really anchor the international order. (Moreover, on his own confession of past bad faith, no one ever really supposed they did.) In place of principles, Carney leans instead on interests—in this case, the supposed interests of middle powers who face a problem like Canada’s, and might be moved (out of self-interest) to do something about it.

----------------------------------------

 

Neither really “realist” nor “idealist,” this much-praised speech was both cynical and utopian—and in that very combination, Carney reveals himself as still a banker at heart. (Carney’s main professional role, prior to coming back to Canada to save its Liberal Party from Justin Trudeau’s unpopularity, was as the head of the Bank of England.) The speech was cynical in its insinuation that everything reduces ultimately to self-interest, narrowly understood—and that the middle powers, accordingly, played along with multilateralism so long as they got the better end of the bargain. But it was also utopian, not so much in its imagination that “another world is possible,” but that such a world would be built neither on new principles, nor on the present interests of the great powers, but as the construction of middling countries committed to securing a failing status quo—achieving something like hegemony without the hegemon.

To go from stirring rhetoric to concrete policies: what could these middle powers, if they did manage to band together, do for a new cross-border payment clearing system? Market access provisions? Credit facilities? International unit of account? As a former central banker, Carney may have original ideas on these matters. But then who’s going to keep the sea lanes clear now? A new naval alliance of this coalition of the middling? Or will China now agree to do so on for the same reasons the United States has historically done? 

Ukraine evidently counts as a middle power being devoured by its local hegemon. On Carney’s view, it is more or less Canada (better, Greenland) in the apocalyptic mirror. But does Taiwan not also count as a middle power? And will Canada join with it to resist the hegemon on its doorstep? If so, what does Carney hope to gain from his new partnership with Beijing?

Playing off hegemons against each other may seem a strategy to keep Canada safe, but it offers no real renewal of multilateralism. Nowhere in his speech did Carney express support for revitalizing the United Nations system (despite passing praise for the Charter) or consider other efforts to remake the world economic order—for example, forging closer trade ties with developing democracies (e.g., India, Brazil, Nigeria, Indonesia, South Africa) as a counter-weight to the dueling hegemons of China and the United States—perhaps even as the foundation of a new and more democratic world order. But perhaps that “fiction” would not prove useful to Canada.

> “Cynical utopianism is not a good basis for foreign policy.”

Cynical utopianism has, of course, always been a banker’s way of thought, so it not surprising to see Carney’s vision reduce to it ultimately. Adam Smith’s invisible hand combined just such a deflationary account of principle—as nothing but self-interest disguised—along with the fantasy of collective good vouchsafed by providence. But cynical utopianism is not a good basis for foreign policy. Ironically, it is at once too radical in supposing it can ignore great power politics in making another world and yet also too conservative in trying to uphold a failing status quo. Those seeking a different, better future than the chaos rising all around us need a better guide than Mark Carney.
