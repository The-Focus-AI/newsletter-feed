Shannon Stapleton/ReutersFuror erupted across the US after immigration agents on Saturday shot and killed a second person in Minnesota, escalating tensions over the Trump administration’s deportation crackdown. Video footage appeared to show authorities firing on the man, a 37-year-old ICU nurse and American citizen, [at least 10 times](https://semafor.com/s/K8qiiIpdjI?email=wschenk@gmail.com) after they removed a gun from his waistband, [contradicting the White House’s account](https://semafor.com/s/gKVQbcTiYC?email=wschenk@gmail.com) of the incident. More than 60 CEOs called for “[immediate de-escalation](https://semafor.com/s/MSqiw4EH0D?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” and Democrats could [partially shut down the federal government this week](https://semafor.com/s/fG0EliIGb1?email=wschenk@gmail.com) by blocking homeland security funding. For weeks, federal agents have been “visibly unprepared [to handle the policing situations their presence created](https://semafor.com/s/IBsHADBMmm?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” The New York Times wrote. The latest shooting, according to The Minnesota Star Tribune, “[upended any sense](https://semafor.com/s/XjmqVA7gM9?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” that tensions would ease.

↓↓22Shooting adds to pressure facing Trump

 
Saturday’s killing by US immigration agents in Minneapolis is set to compound the political pressure on President Donald Trump as his domestic and foreign agendas face sharper opposition, analysts said. The shooting “is a [crescendo rather than a singular event](https://semafor.com/s/ydLMNUb0UR?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” CNN wrote, and accompanies a broader “[change in atmosphere](https://semafor.com/s/Etbja2xN8Y?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” The Washington Post wrote, as those in Trump’s crosshairs — from Washington to [Brussels](https://semafor.com/s/PkUKFaKz4t?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — take a firmer approach to his tactics. “There is this new energy when our allies are rattling the saber back, and that is in turn emboldening folks at home,” a Republican strategist said. The global press cast the shooting as a [crisis for Trump and the country](https://semafor.com/s/WLxjbJ2bMK?email=wschenk@gmail.com). “American politics is likely to [descend into chaos this year](https://semafor.com/s/618bjhRXaH?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” a Chinese state outlet wrote.

↓↓33China’s top general removed

 
Tingshu Wang/Reuters 
Tingshu Wang/ReutersChina’s top general was ousted after being accused of leaking nuclear secrets to the US, a stunning purge that raises questions about Beijing’s military readiness. Zhang Youxia — who was [second in military command](https://semafor.com/s/7GMHGdIqvh?email=wschenk@gmail.com) only to Chinese leader Xi Jinping and considered one of his closest confidants — allegedly undermined Xi’s authority, official statements suggest, but The Wall Street Journal reported that he was also accused of [providing data on China’s nuclear weapons](https://semafor.com/s/zNBthYqhnf?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to Washington. Xi has overseen a [corruption crackdown](https://semafor.com/s/ejsOP4KCkH?email=wschenk@gmail.com), cementing his grip on power, though Zhang’s ouster deals a blow to Beijing’s chain of command that could take years to rebuild, analysts said. “The chances of an attack on Taiwan in the short term [have been lowered](https://semafor.com/s/SR3u3KuIYJ?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” a Taipei-based expert said.

↓↓44New Pentagon plan deprioritizes China

 
Jessica Koscielniak/Reuters 
Jessica Koscielniak/ReutersA new US national security strategy deprioritized China as the military’s top threat, shifting focus to the homeland and Western Hemisphere. The Pentagon plan calls for the abandonment of “[grandiose strategies](https://semafor.com/s/hsyj75XZZZ?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” and prioritizes diplomacy with Beijing in an effort to deter the superpower “through strength, not confrontation.” It signals a longer-term goal of [reducing Washington’s military role](https://semafor.com/s/Y1fMnnI79X?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East. But even as the Pentagon strikes a more conciliatory tone toward Beijing, many in President Donald Trump’s inner circle view the “Donroe Doctrine” — Trump’s [focus on the Western Hemisphere](https://semafor.com/s/k5LpcQPfPb?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — as a show of might that [weakens China’s geostrategic influence](https://semafor.com/s/rVq1JvsPEI?email=wschenk@gmail.com), Nikkei wrote.

↓↓55Trump warns Canada over China deal

 
US President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened Canada with 100% tariffs if Ottawa strikes a broad trade deal with China, deepening the spat between the North American neighbors. Canada last week agreed to [lower tariffs](https://semafor.com/s/WRdNEyXMNa?email=wschenk@gmail.com) on Chinese EVs in exchange for Beijing dropping duties on key Canadian agricultural imports — at the time, Trump said it was “[a good thing](https://semafor.com/s/ogscWIjB2Q?email=wschenk@gmail.com).” But he [soured on Mark Carney](https://semafor.com/s/7dk9fxD9vT?email=wschenk@gmail.com) after the Canadian prime minister gave a speech in Davos declaring that the US-led world order had ruptured. Ottawa should “deploy [strategic empathy and political theatre](https://semafor.com/s/VoZtJjRdBQ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to meet the administration where it’s at,” a geopolitical consultant wrote in The Globe and Mail, calling for a “splashy deal” that addresses Trump’s longstanding but minor grievances.

↓↓66US to make biggest rare earth investment

USA Rare Earth CEO Barbara Humpton. Paul Morigi/Getty Images for SemaforThe US government is reportedly pursuing a $1.6 billion investment in an American rare earth company, its largest such foray into the sector, as Washington looks to build up its domestic mineral supply chain. The planned 10% stake in USA Rare Earth, the Financial Times reported, marks the [latest intervention by the Trump administration](https://semafor.com/s/TCfKo4vWR4?email=wschenk@gmail.com) into private industries it deems central to national security: The government has stakes in at least six other minerals companies. USA Rare Earth’s CEO told Semafor last year that she welcomed the administration’s involvement. “We have a very fragile supply chain that [relies on the whole country of China](https://semafor.com/s/lsVxyRxR5a?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” she said. “Our job now… is to take this off of the geopolitical leverage game board.”

↓↓77Dangerous winter storm blasts US

 
Jeenah Moon/Reuters 
Jeenah Moon/ReutersA massive winter storm pounded much of the US with snow, ice, and dangerously cold temperatures. Airlines canceled more than 17,000 flights on Sunday — [a level last seen during the early days of the pandemic](https://semafor.com/s/KseBsZA2fD?email=wschenk@gmail.com), according to an aviation analytics firm — while [ice across the mid-Atlantic and South knocked out power](https://semafor.com/s/L8hNBQbbZo?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for more than 1 million customers; outages could last for days in hard-hit areas like Nashville. The storm shattered records and was unique in its spread, stretching from New Mexico to New England: Copenhagen, New York, saw a temperature reading of minus 49°F (minus 45°C). “An [Arctic siege has taken over our state](https://semafor.com/s/Qaefg0vHJs?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” the governor said.

↓↓88Ozempic could save airlines millions

 
Hamuda Hassan/Reuters 
Hamuda Hassan/ReutersWeight-loss drugs such as Ozempic could save airlines millions, research suggested. Lighter aircraft need less fuel — and planes with less fuel are lighter, saving more weight, making every kilogram of payload saved even more important. Airlines are thus “obsessive” [about reducing weight](https://semafor.com/s/R3CSCZOoi3?email=wschenk@gmail.com), The Washington Post reported: One carrier’s decision to use lighter paper in its in-flight magazine saved it $290,000 a year in fuel. But airlines have been unable to control passengers’ growing waistlines. The recent peak in US obesity, which coincided with the rise of GLP-1 drugs, could change that: If passenger weight dropped 10%, the four largest US carriers could save as much as $580 million per year.

↓↓99Early vertebrates may have had four eyes

Our oldest vertebrate ancestors may have had four eyes. The earliest known vertebrates — animals with spinal columns — are jawless fish that lived more than half a billion years ago. Fossils of two species found in southwest China between 2019 and 2024 had partially preserved the animals’ bones and soft tissue — even their eyes. Vertebrate eyes contain pigment structures called melanosomes that determine eye color; the researchers found melanosomes in the usual places, but also in [two smaller patches between the eyes](https://semafor.com/s/rIwEFWJqki?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Scientists posit that the extra pair of eyes eventually evolved in mammals into the pineal gland, which regulates our sleep cycle. Some rare reptiles still have a third, light-sensitive organ atop their heads.

↓↓1010Gen Z embraces Y2K fashion

 
Moritz Scholz/Getty Images 
Moritz Scholz/Getty ImagesGen Z has revived the trends of the 1990s and early 2000s, down to the baggy, low-rise jeans, Ugg slippers, and sweatpants with words written on the backside. The “Y2K aesthetic” reimagines the fashions of elder millennials from the turn of the century. The Washington Post’s retail correspondent argued that it “[speaks to a yearning for what [young people] perceive as simpler times](https://semafor.com/s/w1zRnfXrVn?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” before phones and brain rot. Alternatively, it could be the usual 20-year fashion cycle, where everything old becomes new again. Whatever the explanation, Gen Z — if they truly embrace the style of the fin-de-siècle years — will, as their forebears did, have to work out how to stop treading on the backs of their needlessly enormous trousers.

Oktaviana, A.A., Joannes-Boyau, R., Hakim, B. et al. in Nature/CC BY-ND 4.0Research found that drawings in an Indonesian cave are likely the world’s oldest known rock art, changing our understanding both of the development of human creativity and of our species’ spread through Asia. The art, made by spraying pigment while using the hand as a stencil, is at least 67,800 years old, 1,100 years older than the oldest previously known rock art, from Spain. The researchers believe, due to the art’s complexity, that the artists were Homo sapiens. It implies that the region’s first settlers already had “[a sophisticated artistic culture](https://semafor.com/s/muMEO3Xpc1?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” they wrote in Nature, but also that the ancient settlers of Papua New Guinea and Australia traveled by a northern route via Sulawesi rather than a southern one via Java.
