Maxim Shemetov/Reuters 
Maxim Shemetov/ReutersWashington and Beijing have signed off on a deal to sell TikTok’s American business to a consortium of mostly US investors, capping a yearslong battle between the two superpowers over the app, Semafor reported. The pact, set to close this week, [removes a sticking point](https://semafor.com/s/CTemlulhqT?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in US-China relations: Former President Joe Biden had threatened to ban TikTok if its Chinese parent company ByteDance did not divest its US business. It’s unclear, though, what negotiations occurred over who will oversee TikTok’s powerful algorithm, [the app’s crown jewel](https://semafor.com/s/W88Ulqt89O?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that has been the main point of contention between the two countries and has scuttled past deals.

↓↓22Enthusiasm for Chinese chipmakers

 
Chinese AI chipmaker Moore Threads tripled its revenue in 2025, estimates show, as Beijing accelerates its push for technological self-sufficiency. The company, which aims to rival Nvidia, is at the [front of a stream](https://semafor.com/s/3HvJB2aXOK?email=wschenk@gmail.com) of Chinese chip firms going public: Tech giants [Alibaba](https://semafor.com/s/QvLct57BGU?email=wschenk@gmail.com) and [Baidu](https://semafor.com/s/OskB1IA2qv?email=wschenk@gmail.com) plan to spin off their semiconductor units as independent listings in a bid to [capitalize on enthusiasm](https://semafor.com/s/r5vHeYCR52?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for locally made processors. That domestic push is central to the debate over Beijing’s move to [restrict imports of powerful Nvidia H200 chips](https://semafor.com/s/hsP5JNtWcg?email=wschenk@gmail.com) after Washington approved their sale. China wants to reduce reliance on US tech, but Chinese companies are hungry for the superior Nvidia products, with some considering sourcing [H200s from the black market](https://semafor.com/s/8bmoyy94jz?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓33US lays out ‘New Gaza’ vision

 
Denis Balibouse/Reuters 
Denis Balibouse/ReutersUS officials on Thursday laid out an ambitious vision for a “New Gaza,” replete with skyscrapers and luxury homes. The plan envisages [$25 billion in investment](https://semafor.com/s/dp6hfT6AT5?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to rebuild the devastated enclave within three years, Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner told business leaders at Davos. But the splashy reconstruction ideas “[exist mostly on paper](https://semafor.com/s/UfvQ5zOkLk?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” The New York Times wrote. Israel and Hamas first need to advance a [fragile US-brokered ceasefire](https://semafor.com/s/RD4r79S28Z?email=wschenk@gmail.com): Central to that task is the demilitarization of Hamas, whose members have been promised amnesty for disarming. Kushner said his “master plan” was aimed at “[catastrophic success](https://semafor.com/s/GQbo6iJdlv?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” but Hamas hasn’t agreed to give up its weapons, and Trump’s Board of Peace to oversee Gaza’s reconstruction [lacks Palestinian representation](https://semafor.com/s/IMfQyMgsj1?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓44Europe recalibrates future of US ties

Harun Ozalp/Anadolu via Getty ImagesEurope’s leaders huddled Thursday to recalibrate the future of their relationship with the US after a week of diplomatic tumult. The emergency summit was convened before US President Donald Trump dropped his tariff threat against eight European countries over Greenland, but “the [damage has been done](https://semafor.com/s/TCxqhFH616?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” to the transatlantic relationship, Bloomberg’s Brussels bureau chief wrote. Politico summed up the lasting feeling as “[dread and skepticism](https://semafor.com/s/8SicQMRy0y?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” despite Trump’s climbdown of his Greenland ambitions and reports that his deal with NATO [would respect Denmark’s sovereignty](https://semafor.com/s/ZnAGhAu3Gy?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Europe’s uncertain approach to Trump prompted a scathing rebuke from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Davos, who said Thursday that far from becoming a global power, “[Europe looks lost](https://semafor.com/s/93lNgANoUz?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

↓↓55Poland begins major overhaul of navy

 
Poland began the largest overhaul of its navy since the Cold War to bolster defenses in the face of Russian expansionism and transatlantic tensions. Warsaw is proportionally NATO’s biggest spender, with 4.7% of GDP going to defense, but its [maritime forces have largely been neglected](https://semafor.com/s/ps78drIBRI?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Moscow’s escalating hybrid warfare, however, has heightened security concerns in the Baltic Sea, and Europe is stepping up coordination and production: Warsaw will buy three new submarines from Sweden, and is expected to sign a defense agreement with the UK. Europe lacks initiative, not ideas, when it comes to innovative defense coordination, the Stimson Center argued, perhaps because it fears that “[bold action](https://semafor.com/s/DOp26eVNxs?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” could exacerbate US President Donald Trump’s hostility toward the continent.

↓↓66Making Davos relevant again

 
Denis Balibouse/Reuters 
Denis Balibouse/ReutersThe World Economic Forum is back from the brink, thanks to Donald Trump and the CEO of the world’s largest money manager, according to longtime Davos attendees. After the departure of chair Klaus Schwab, BlackRock’s Larry Fink took over the annual Swiss confab, which in recent years had started to feel more like a “[live-action alpine LinkedIn](https://semafor.com/s/tmZbUoUls7?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” instead of the world’s most important gathering, one frequent visitor observed in The Globe and Mail. But a [defining speech](https://semafor.com/s/lHxXprgoNx?email=wschenk@gmail.com) from Canada’s Mark Carney, the [launch of Trump’s Board of Peace](https://semafor.com/s/j0T4Y9DdZX?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and the US leader’s typical bombast injected relevancy into this year’s global gathering. “If Davos was less free-wheeling than in years past, [so is the world](https://semafor.com/s/Yh4IBxXWfd?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” two Semafor editors wrote from the event.

↓↓77Trump sues JPMorgan, Dimon

 
Mike Segar/Reuters 
Mike Segar/ReutersUS President Donald Trump on Thursday sued JPMorgan Chase and CEO Jamie Dimon, alleging they illegally “debanked” him. The bank closed accounts for Trump and his businesses several weeks after the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot; the president has zeroed in on JPMorgan in his effort to oppose what he and his allies see as a systemic effort among financial institutions to [refuse services](https://semafor.com/s/4QDU64G0EW?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to conservatives. The bank said it doesn’t close accounts for political reasons. Dimon has recently been critical about some of Trump’s economic policies, including tariffs and his proposed credit card [interest rate cap](https://semafor.com/s/KthggoGWI4?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Other Wall Street CEOs at Davos, Bloomberg noted, are taking a different approach to Trump: [avoiding talking about him](https://semafor.com/s/mGVNmPWAS9?email=wschenk@gmail.com) at all.

Wagner Moura. Mike Blake/ReutersInternational films were represented in all four Oscars acting categories for the first time, reflecting an Academy Awards that is increasingly looking beyond Hollywood. Titles financed and produced outside the US, which predominantly featured non-English languages, were “[not only present but dominant](https://semafor.com/s/pAgQNOuMBu?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” Deadline wrote: Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård grabbed a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Norwegian film Sentimental Value, Wagner Moura became the first Brazilian Best Actor nominee, and KPop Demon Hunters — the animated juggernaut that was American-made but centered on Korean culture — [scooped two nominations](https://semafor.com/s/I7dLVE0NWe?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Thanks to streaming platforms, foreign-language content is now “mainstream viewing,” Monocle wrote, while institutions, not viewers, “[continue to draw borders that the screen itself has already dissolved](https://semafor.com/s/fTRuGdlew4?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

↓↓99Growing appetite for spicy food

Jonathan Wong/South China Morning Post via Getty ImagesDiners are seeking ever spicier foods. Sichuan restaurants are replacing milder Cantonese ones in Singapore; participants at Berlin’s annual chile festival have increased 13-fold in five years. In the US, 95% of food joints, including burger and pizza places, serve at least one hot option, and surveys find consumers are choosing more fiery foods in dozens of major markets. Researchers told Bloomberg that the change was downstream of globalization and immigration, as cuisines spread worldwide, and because social media challenges are “transforming extreme heat from a niche interest [into a badge of honor](https://semafor.com/s/hy2cmmmMa0?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for young people.” The achievement spurs people to seek even more challenging flavors — like “parachuting,” one scientist said: “If you jump once, you want to do it again.”

↓↓1010London’s chimney sweeps are back

Murray Sanders - WPA Pool/Getty ImagesLondon’s chimney sweeps are making a comeback, using a combination of traditional tools and digital technology. The UK’s housing stock is among the world’s oldest — [38% of homes were built before 1946](https://semafor.com/s/746Wr5bohb?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — and chimneys are commonplace. Clean-air laws mean they are rarely used, but the country’s growing energy costs have led some to seek backup heating methods and [reopen their fireplaces](https://semafor.com/s/ukzU3QgAPY?email=wschenk@gmail.com), according to the sweeps’ industry body. There are around 750 registered London sweeps now, up from 590 in 2021. A worker for a family firm that has been sweeping London chimneys since 1860 insisted to The New York Times that a sweep was [as lucky as lucky can be](https://semafor.com/s/mXkYi0zDrT?email=wschenk@gmail.com): “It’s the best job I think I could ever get.”

Rojak is a colloquial Malay word for “eclectic mix,” and is the name for a Javanese dish that typically combines sliced fruit and vegetables with a spicy dressing. In this recurring Flagship feature, we highlight the best newsletter writing from and about Asia.Build, baby, buildWhat do Ezra Klein, Elon Musk, and time-traveling Chinese engineers have in common? The answer lies on the assembly line. An influential online movement in China known as the Industrial Party believes national power is rooted in factories and labs — effectively a “[cult of industrialization](https://semafor.com/s/dNGJBKhfuV?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” rather than a formal organization, according to Fred Gao, a Beijing-based journalist for a state broadcaster. The Industrial Party stemmed from online forums that later inspired a viral time-travel novel about a group of modern-day Chinese people who build an industrialized society from scratch in the Ming Dynasty.The ideas broke into the Chinese mainstream with works like The Three-Body Problem and The Wandering Earth, but the movement has been declining since 2018 as employees pushed back against relentless work culture in service of the state, Gao wrote in his newsletter Inside China. The Industrial Party’s ideas face similar challenges to Klein’s Abundance agenda and the right-wing “Dark Enlightenment” ideology that some American tech leaders subscribe to. All push for aggressive building — albeit for different reasons — but “in the soil of post-industrial society, that pure cultural worship of industrialization that once drove the wheels of history can no longer be revived.”Pardon Mi?Chinese phone and EV maker Xiaomi landed in a public relations quagmire for paying an influencer who previously trashed the company and its customers. Zong Ning, who has more than 2.5 million Weibo followers and is known as “All-Powerful Big Bear,” once called Xiaomi phone users “bottom-tier losers” — he has a history of friction with several major Chinese tech brands. But he recently began praising Xiaomi and its founder, and earlier this month boasted that the company had paid him for publicity.The backlash was swift, in part because of the emotional connection Xiaomi has with its devotees, The East is Read wrote. The firm grew its brand based on intimacy, with followers known as “Mi Fans” who have long interacted directly with Xiaomi executives in online forums. This “[transformed buyers into stakeholders](https://semafor.com/s/ELm32iGmyz?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” and intensified the revolt over the Big Bear stunt, the Substack noted. Xiaomi punished senior executives — a rare move — in an acknowledgement that conventional PR tactics can’t supersede customer loyalty.We are the worldAn ambitious bureaucrat and a Boston teacher deserve credit for shaping the contemporary Japanese music scene. In the late 1800s, Japanese education official Isawa Shūji was sent to the northeastern US to study American systems. Isawa wasn’t a musical genius, but was “looking for his chance to [leave a mark on Japanese history](https://semafor.com/s/f23ysswWFw?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” and stumbled upon music education as his platform, modern Japan historian Patrick Patterson wrote on his Substack. A local music teacher helped Isawa organize a curriculum for Japan’s children, who would end up learning Western music styles and instruments.His efforts eventually led to the founding of the Tokyo Academy of Music, and a host of Japanese songs built on Western frameworks: The Scottish Auld Lang Syne inspired Hotaru no hikari, now a classic Japanese New Year’s song. To justify importing Western styles, Isawa argued Japan’s musical traditions shared ancient roots with Western classical music, so “re-merging the two” made sense and elevated his country’s culture. “Doing this changed Japanese conceptions of music completely” and ushered in a new era of mass-produced pop songs.— J.D.

Secretaria de Turismo e Comércio de Varginha/YouTube 
Secretaria de Turismo e Comércio de Varginha/YouTubeThe mystery surrounding Brazil’s most famous extraterrestrial sighting continues to captivate, with a new documentary and ufology conference on its 30th anniversary. About 250 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro, the coffee-producing powerhouse of Varginha functions somewhat like a Brazilian version of the US’ Roswell, New Mexico. Numerous local landmarks pay homage to the putative outer-space visitor, whose appearance three decades ago is being honored in Varginha this weekend. The legend has endured in large part due to allegations of a military cover-up, though for its part, Brazil’s Superior Military Court notes that “the complete official investigation into the Varginha ET incident is [fully digitized and available to any internet user](https://semafor.com/s/7XMyDIrmXL?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” El País reported.
