↓↓11Trump locks in on Greenland

 
US President Donald Trump suggested that his failure to win the Nobel Peace Prize was driving his recent aggression toward Greenland. His text to the Norwegian prime minister intensified growing European concern over Washington’s designs on the Danish territory: Trump over the weekend threatened tariffs on European nations opposed to his efforts, while EU capitals are considering [a €93 billion ($108 billion) package of levies](https://semafor.com/s/t8zRJBzTuA?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in response. The stunning row has consequences which extend far beyond the largely uninhabited landmass, distracting from the war in Ukraine and widening a rift in the transatlantic alliance, potentially “[tearing NATO apart](https://semafor.com/s/DR6YBtqm3M?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” as The Economist put it. Meanwhile, Chinese officials are “[gleefully anticipating Europe’s humiliation](https://semafor.com/s/EAlchx1RLA?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” the Financial Times’ chief foreign affairs commentator warned.

↓↓22Davos opens with fresh direction

 
Denis Balibouse/Reuters 
Denis Balibouse/ReutersThe Davos summit of world leaders and business executives opened on Monday, with backers hailing its revival — thanks, in large part, to BlackRock’s chief executive. This year’s edition of the World Economic Forum is the first without its founder, Klaus Schwab. In his place, BlackRock boss Larry Fink has largely taken over, becoming “[a quiet force reshaping the forum](https://semafor.com/s/neAQWP32NK?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” The New York Times’ Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote. Fink’s leadership offers an opportunity to [reinvent a conference](https://semafor.com/s/p9YkBIHfCf?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that critics argue has fallen out of kilter with global trends, a former WEF head of communications added. “[Fink himself was once a proto-Davos Man](https://semafor.com/s/RbYwNHbteO?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” Semafor’s Liz Hoffman noted in our Davos Daily. “His repriced conversion, and Davos’, feels more or less complete.”

↓↓33Optimism over US economy

 
Experts painted a rosy picture for the US economy for the year ahead. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal [increased their estimates](https://semafor.com/s/zJljDsYZae?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for growth in both 2025 and 2026, while Apollo’s chief economist noted prediction markets have [slashed their bets on a recession](https://semafor.com/s/sKrgWNTwL6?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Goldman Sachs’ chief US economist went further, arguing that the bank’s “[strongest conviction views](https://semafor.com/s/ZoTfH5lxzJ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for 2026 are our above-consensus GDP growth forecast and our below-consensus inflation forecast.” That bullish outlook is in keeping with [improving forecasts for global growth](https://semafor.com/s/cfm1ZEOqn4?email=wschenk@gmail.com). But not everyone is convinced: One leading economist who forecast the dot-com bubble and the 2008 financial crash is [voicing worry of an AI bubble](https://semafor.com/s/SWh5YZRUwK?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and US voters are increasingly [rating the economy as weak](https://semafor.com/s/4DfRT8F1Ny?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓44China’s two-track economy

 
China’s economy grew 5% last year, meeting Beijing’s target but highlighting a widening gap in the country’s two-track economy. While China’s export industries weathered US tariffs — Beijing’s trade surplus [reached a record $1.2 trillion in 2025](https://semafor.com/s/63TASS9AbE?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — [anemic domestic consumption](https://semafor.com/s/LufBlXkeCg?email=wschenk@gmail.com) and [a faltering real estate sector](https://semafor.com/s/QkBwAPi39K?email=wschenk@gmail.com) weighed on growth. The world’s second-biggest economy faces plenty of other challenges, too, including the threat of persistent deflation, elevated youth unemployment, and a huge and opaque pile of local-government debt. The mixed figures “[may be simultaneously too good and too bad to be true,](https://semafor.com/s/T7A9dvM0YS?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” The Economist reported: Falling prices mean China’s nominal growth was lower than the reported figures, while “awful” investment numbers may have been skewed by past “statistical shenanigans.”

↓↓55China’s demographic dilemma

 
China’s birthrate fell to its lowest level on record in 2025, and its population shrank for a fourth consecutive year. The problem is widespread: France [recorded more deaths than births last year](https://semafor.com/s/AJiABrGeAq?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for the first time since World War II, and among wealthy nations, only Israel has a fertility rate above replacement. But China’s issue is especially acute, with a growing cohort of retirees and a shrinking number of workers, all grappling with a threadbare social-safety net. Beijing’s efforts to boost childbearing — ranging from increased support for childcare to doing away with the one-child policy — have been “[met with a collective shrug](https://semafor.com/s/hMIqfpnhxU?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” by young people, The New York Times reported.

↓↓66Growing opposition to ICE in US

 
Brian Snyder/Reuters 
Brian Snyder/ReutersUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement is facing legal pushback and growing protests after high-profile shootings. An ICE agent shot a Minneapolis woman dead this month, in what the White House called self-defense and local officials called murder. Another two people were wounded a day later. Demonstrations have led to clashes, and 1,500 troops are on standby. A federal judge [ordered the agency to pare back crowd control tactics](https://semafor.com/s/BnVUduogeI?email=wschenk@gmail.com), banning it from arresting or pepper-spraying peaceful protesters, but US President Donald Trump has pledged to continue mass deportations. A former ICE director told Politico that the agency’s politicization is damaging relationships with law enforcement and city authorities: “[It’s going to take ICE a long time to dig out of this](https://semafor.com/s/R4mjrC8RYm?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

↓↓77Syria’s precarious unification path

 
Karam al-Masri/Reuters 
Karam al-Masri/ReutersSyria said it had reached a ceasefire with a US-backed Kurdish militia, opening a path to unifying the fractured country after years of civil war. The Syrian Democratic Forces control large parts of northeast Syria, and were a longstanding ally of Washington against the Islamic State group. But Damascus, [seeking to unify the country](https://semafor.com/s/sQQGfC9cu1?email=wschenk@gmail.com), demanded the SDF integrate now that the Assad dictatorship has fallen and IS is significantly weakened. Tensions had given way to fighting, and over the weekend Damascus declared a series of battlefield victories over the SDF. The ceasefire calls for an “immediate administrative and military” handover of SDF-controlled areas, although Kurds remain distrustful, The Washington Post reported.

↓↓88Delcy moves to consolidate power

 
Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/File Photo/Reuters 
Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/File Photo/ReutersVenezuelan interim President Delcy Rodríguez moved to tighten her grip on power, installing loyalists in top positions to insulate herself from internal threats. Rodríguez has [replaced the head of the central bank](https://semafor.com/s/dnO0SdBXP3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) and the leader of a feared intelligence agency amid worries that a military faction or militia group could attempt to oust her. One key figure helping Rodríguez maintain her grip on power is [Venezuela’s powerful interior minister](https://semafor.com/s/LqFuOS5Zi9?email=wschenk@gmail.com), who has reportedly been in touch with US officials keen to keep him on side in order to maintain relative stability, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Rodríguez has vowed to continue working with the US, calling for a pragmatic approach as both Caracas and Washington look to boost Venezuela’s moribund oil industry.

↓↓99Africa’s commercial football boom

 
Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters 
Amr Abdallah Dalsh/ReutersSenegal defeated Morocco to win a second men’s African Cup of Nations, a tournament undergoing a commercial boom. The 1-0 extra time victory was marred by a brief walkout and questionable refereeing decisions, a controversial cap to a tournament that otherwise played out as expected. Its financial success, meanwhile, bodes well for future editions: Revenues [rose 90% compared to the previous tournament](https://semafor.com/s/CMAPkyE4tl?email=wschenk@gmail.com), while event sponsors numbered 23 compared to just nine in 2021. A decision by the continental governing body to host the tournament every four years from the current two is also positive: Analysts told Semafor the scarcity created by the new format will likely [boost the value of broadcast rights](https://semafor.com/s/nbR4o9eMEE?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓1010Wine sales drops as loneliness rises

 
Falling wine sales represent not just a problem for the industry, but perhaps also for society. Shrinking demand means producers worldwide have an overstock — [grape harvests come each year whether the vintners want them or not](https://semafor.com/s/VRvMCwpuqi?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — and prices are down: A bottle from Bordeaux retails below €2 in France. Declining sales are usually attributed to health-conscious youngsters, but alcohol, and especially wine, consumption is down across the demographics in rich countries, The Economist said. The underlying reason is that we “[increasingly live, and eat, alone](https://semafor.com/s/msLc4n5DCV?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” and wine-drinking is social. Perhaps that will change, The Wall Street Journal’s wine columnist argued: The “stigma” of [drinking a glass of wine alone](https://semafor.com/s/AzHmTTYoLg?email=wschenk@gmail.com) appears to be fading.

Moon shotsThe first vaccine was an act of serendipity: In 1796, Edward Jenner noticed that cowpox infection protected against smallpox, without understanding why. Louis Pasteur, in the 19th century, systematized production, finding methods such as attenuation and inactivation that could be applied to other diseases. He developed inoculations for chicken cholera, anthrax, and rabies through trial and error; [he lacked the technology to actually see the pathogens](https://semafor.com/s/nZQlHyyyax?email=wschenk@gmail.com), even if he knew they were there. Now, two centuries after Jenner, we are in a golden age of vaccine discovery, Saloni Dattani argues in Works in Progress.Advances in microscopy were crucial, first with light microscopes which allowed Robert Koch to identify the tuberculosis bacterium, and later with electron microscopes that revealed viruses. In the 1980s, cryo-electron microscopy permitted scientists to see pathogens at atomic resolution and develop vaccines targeting protein structures. Vaccines began to aim at subunits, such as the coronavirus’ spike protein, rather than the entire pathogen, and genomic sequencing and RNA technology mean vaccines can be redesigned in weeks rather than years.So long, and thanks for all the -bert suffixesScott Adams, the recently deceased creator of Dilbert comics and also of much internet controversy, played a big part in the blogger Scott Alexander’s life; the latter read every Dilbert book before leaving elementary school. Adams’ work, says Alexander, was about “the nerd experience… of being the only sane man in a crazy world,” and yet, somehow, always losing. Idiot pointy-haired bosses and charismatic manipulators do well; the brilliant, hardworking Dilberts and Alices lose out. “This is the basic engine of Dilbert: everyone is rewarded in exact inverse proportion to their virtue.”The tragedy of Adams, Alexander wrote, is that he tried to become the pointy-haired boss, or at least a charismatic manipulator, rather than accepting the nerd that he was. He got into hypnosis and persuasion techniques, but it never quite seemed to work. Then, in 2015, he predicted — against the consensus — that Donald Trump would win the US presidency. This made him a huge media star, which ultimately ended up driving him mad. After one particularly unacceptable comment, most of his work dried up, and when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, he treated it with the anti-parasite drug ivermectin. Alexander, a humorist of some skill himself, says that he owes that skill “to cramming Adams’ advice into a malleable immature brain… I can’t endorse either Adams’ politics or his persuasive methods, [but] [I consider Adams a teacher](https://semafor.com/s/6mDmOr6Wlf?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”*nb: usually I try to avoid using the same author twice in quick succession, and I used Scott Alexander last week, but this was timely and also rather moving.Mambo number twoBay Area parties are famously odd, but those hosted by Aella, the rationalist sex worker and pseudonymous blogger, do appear to be among the oddest. She threw one for Halloween, and, having written on the invitation that there would be “no surprises,” decided that that would make people expect a surprise. “Damnit,” she wrote. “I guess we need to make a surprise then?” After an increasingly desperate brainstorm session, the party organizers settled — listen, I told you it was odd — on a “poop whodunnit,” in which, during the middle of the party, the lights went out briefly, and when they came back on there would be a turd in the middle of the floor, and the rest of the evening would be spent working out whose it was.But the first person they asked to be the mystery pooper declined unexpectedly (to one cohost’s surprise: “I totally thought she would poop on the floor”). After that, “we sat down and churned out calls and texts to ~45 attendees” trying to find someone who would be willing to do the deed; not live, but pre-pooped and frozen. In the event, they did not go ahead with it, but instead ran a slideshow revealing the spread of those who agreed and, in some cases, actually went ahead and got a sample ready. “[It was the most fun I’ve ever had preparing for an event](https://semafor.com/s/Hq0lavXI2l?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” says Aella, despite no one, in the end, being a party pooper.— Tom Chivers

Welcome to Night Vale, by Jeffrey Cranor and Joseph Fink. This is, says The Verge, probably the longest continually running fiction podcast in the world; it’s been going for 12 seasons over 14 years, with 280 episodes. It draws heavily on HP Lovecraft — there are dark and strange things going on in a seemingly normal US town — but Cranor and Fink turn up the absurdity, going for laughs as much as scares: It “takes [Lovecraftian] horrors and [exposes them for what they are: entertainment](https://semafor.com/s/MeAiNWkFPW?email=wschenk@gmail.com).” Listen to Welcome to Night Vale on Apple Podcasts.
