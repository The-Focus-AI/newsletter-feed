↓↓11Carney warns of global order ‘rupture’

 
Denis Balibouse/Reuters 
Denis Balibouse/ReutersCanada’s prime minister argued US aggression and protectionism had triggered a “rupture” in the global order, requiring middle powers such as his to unite — remarks in Davos likely to contrast with an address from the American leader today. Mark Carney’s speech did not explicitly mention US President Donald Trump but clearly focused on him, warning against “using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as [vulnerabilities to be exploited](https://semafor.com/s/qcqxh78Jia?email=wschenk@gmail.com).” His comments were largely [echoed by France’s president](https://semafor.com/s/wwfYlNQU8k?email=wschenk@gmail.com) and [the head of the European Commission](https://semafor.com/s/S4geMOhSQx?email=wschenk@gmail.com), though Trump seems unfazed: Before heading to Davos, he refused, for example, to [rule out using military force to seize Greenland](https://semafor.com/s/dP20xx9ETv?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓22US NATO pullback sparks concern

 
The head of NATO and Donald Trump. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters 
The head of NATO and Donald Trump. Kevin Lamarque/ReutersThe US is reportedly planning to partly reduce its participation in NATO, exacerbating worry among alliance members already grappling with Washington’s threats towards Greenland. The shifts [will be gradual](https://semafor.com/s/RhJTYt33ib?email=wschenk@gmail.com) and have been [planned for months](https://semafor.com/s/w7dfpgjCS7?email=wschenk@gmail.com), The Washington Post and Financial Times reported. However, their symbolic impact — coming amid a transatlantic crisis over US President Donald Trump’s call to annex Greenland, and disagreement over supporting Ukraine — is significant. A senior Time journalist contrasted the Trump administration’s approach with that of George W. Bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks: “Unlike that stretch of norm testing, Washington is not leaning on the decades-old alliance of NATO but rather seems intent on [destroying it from within](https://semafor.com/s/imTyF50UPu?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

↓↓33Anthropic warns on chip sales to China

 
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei equated Washington’s decision to allow Nvidia to manufacture AI chips for China with “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea.” Speaking at the World Economic Forum, the head of the AI giant told Bloomberg that the US is “many years ahead of China” in chipmaking ability, but that the move by Nvidia — a major Anthropic investor — and the Trump administration was “crazy,” and had “[incredible national security implications](https://semafor.com/s/CoKqoxBd2P?email=wschenk@gmail.com).” There are two summits underway in Davos, Semafor’s Reed Albergotti reported: One geopolitics-focused, centered on “[Greenland, Venezuela, and the rewriting of the world order](https://semafor.com/s/hFy9DY5vaL?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” and the other a high-end tech conference of dealmaking and selling. Amodei’s comments are a reminder that the two sides remain strongly linked.

↓↓44China courts US allies

 
The UK and China want to revive a “[golden era](https://semafor.com/s/8Sf06E1LKf?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” of business dialogue when their leaders meet in Beijing next week, part of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s push to court longtime US allies frustrated by Washington. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit follows a trip by Canada’s leader to Beijing to sign [several new trade agreements](https://semafor.com/s/fadMD0DeHC?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Germany’s chancellor is also set to visit next month. All three nations have faced tariff threats from Washington, and worry about the Trump administration’s threats towards NATO. Yet, warming to Beijing is a tricky alternative: “Frustrations with one American president [need not give way to the agenda of dictators,](https://semafor.com/s/sjPZEFquUu?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” The Washington Post’s editorial board wrote.

↓↓55US eyes new mineral markets

 
The US is looking to Australia and Africa for minerals in an attempt to sidestep Chinese restrictions. The US uranium group Energy Fuels will [buy an Australian miner for $300 million](https://semafor.com/s/JR6OsIEyPP?email=wschenk@gmail.com), the latest deal involving the two countries since Beijing briefly placed export controls on refined rare earths last year; Washington and Canberra have also agreed to each invest $1 billion in mining projects to bolster supply chains. The Democratic Republic of Congo, meanwhile, [offered the US access to an array of state-owned mining projects](https://semafor.com/s/mLFs0oPmoi?email=wschenk@gmail.com), producing cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, and manganese in exchange for development investment and security guarantees, Reuters reported. The move would reduce US reliance on Chinese-controlled mineral processing.

↓↓66US shale production set to plateau

 
A plateauing shale boom in the US is pushing domestic firms to seek opportunities in new markets such as Australia and Venezuela in a bid to boost crude production. Beginning in the early 2000s, hydraulic fracking helped make the US the world’s biggest producer of oil and gas, reducing its dependence on imports. However, growth appears to be slowing: The US Energy Information Administration predicted output will flatten this year and fall in 2027. Though US President Donald Trump has vowed to [expand domestic capacity](https://semafor.com/s/QYvTDRtZqc?email=wschenk@gmail.com), falling oil prices and rising costs mean producers will struggle to break even, while the logistical challenges for shale drillers operating abroad remain [substantial](https://semafor.com/s/ZA2QrO8j7w?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓77US seizes another Venezuela tanker

 
The US seized a seventh Venezuela-linked oil tanker, further consolidating its control over the Latin American nation’s crude industry. Since ousting former President Nicolás Maduro, Washington has tightened its authority over Venezuela, selling its oil abroad — US President Donald Trump said Tuesday his country had taken [50 million barrels out of the country](https://semafor.com/s/1zXFPBfWih?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — and was instrumental in pushing Caracas to ease its foreign investment rules in order to lure international energy companies. Both the Venezuelan regime and the opposition have become reliant on Trump’s directives: Caracas confirmed the first proceeds of a US crude sale [helped prop up the bolívar](https://semafor.com/s/Gywukqz54R?email=wschenk@gmail.com), while Trump said yesterday he was considering giving opposition leader María Corina Machado [a role in determining Venezuela’s future](https://semafor.com/s/e70PrbZQxd?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓88Nuclear power gathers pace globally

 
The global dash to reboot the nuclear power industry accelerated. Britain moved to [extend the life of a major reactor by 20 years](https://semafor.com/s/Dx86eDiTIh?email=wschenk@gmail.com), seeking to bridge a multi-year gap between its older generation facilities retiring and new ones opening, and Japan’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, the world’s largest, [restarts operations today](https://semafor.com/s/vo1Sq28alw?email=wschenk@gmail.com) after 15 years. Building new nuclear sites faces political and regulatory hurdles: France’s EDF churned out dozens in the 1980s, taking just six years for each. Its most recent took 16 years, and the company is turning to China to relearn “[nimble construction](https://semafor.com/s/GgMcgzhEor?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” the Financial Times reported. The Chinese industry has no such problems: [It is constructing 35 units](https://semafor.com/s/rC3n6L2htG?email=wschenk@gmail.com), each expected to take about five years. [The US is building zero](https://semafor.com/s/ESAXDjkdEk?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓99Influential Sega cofounder dies

 
David Rosen, the cofounder of Sega, died aged 95. Born in New York City, Rosen started a photobooth company while serving with the US Air Force in Japan in 1954; it merged with a slot-machine company shortly after. Rosen recognized videogames’ potential early, starting in the 1960s with arcades and then home consoles. He wrote in 1982 that games were among “[the early manifestations of an electronic revolution](https://semafor.com/s/3SwVMDpdzo?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” that would “touch… all of our lives.” Sega created icons such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Mortal Kombat, although it lost out in the 1990s to giant rivals Sony and Microsoft. “[It is difficult to think of a more influential figure](https://semafor.com/s/es43BZLZTv?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” in the world’s largest entertainment industry, The Guardian said.

↓↓1010The rise of ‘romantasy’ fiction

 
Agustin Marcarian/Reuters 
Agustin Marcarian/Reuters“Romantasy” novels, sword-sex-and-sorcery stories for female readers, are propping up the publishing industry. Onyx Storm by Rebecca Yarros, about amorous cadets at a dragon-riding school, became the fastest-selling adult novel in 20 years last year, while the Court of Thorns and Roses series about a woman falling in love with fairy — or “faerie” — lords has sold more than 75 million copies; the genre brought in [an estimated $610 million in 2024](https://semafor.com/s/x84fMud542?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The protagonists are usually women, and the stories [combine fantasy and romance tropes](https://semafor.com/s/hlD0zhBqNW?email=wschenk@gmail.com), The Conversation reported. [US women read more than men](https://semafor.com/s/7zv2v4jtZJ?email=wschenk@gmail.com), recent polling found, with the romantasy genre likely a major driver.

Etel Adnan and Seundja Rhee: To Meet the Sun, White Cube Seoul. The Lebanese Adnan and the South Korean Rhee both ended up in Paris, and turned their artistic minds to abstract forms of celestial bodies: suns, moons, planets. This retrospective examines their work, shaped by their experience of migration and exile. A previous White Cube exhibition of Adnan’s work was highly successful, “[a tightly curated exhibition that transcends and mystifies in equal measure](https://semafor.com/s/MesBIGuzfn?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” according to Frieze; expect more of the same in Seoul. The exhibition runs from Jan. 21 to Mar. 7, 2026. [Buy tickets here](https://semafor.com/s/HB9wJCvxbC?email=wschenk@gmail.com).
