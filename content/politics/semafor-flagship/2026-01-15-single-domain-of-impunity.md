↓↓11Trump threatens Insurrection Act

 
US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to deploy the military in the state of Minnesota to quell widespread protests over an immigration crackdown. Trump’s threat to invoke the Insurrection Act — days after a federal agent [fatally shot](https://semafor.com/s/9tH36nRsgC?email=wschenk@gmail.com) a US citizen in Minneapolis, and hours after another immigration officer [wounded a man](https://semafor.com/s/Yn4IBUQvMG?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — reflects the president’s [emboldened push](https://semafor.com/s/zldFtXnH1A?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for military intervention both at home [and abroad](https://semafor.com/s/BxIPdDDu0C?email=wschenk@gmail.com). From Venezuela to Minnesota to Iran, Trump is remaking “the borders of American state power, [collapsing the foreign and the domestic](https://semafor.com/s/g8myZqYSgP?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in a single domain of impunity,” Equator magazine argued, by redirecting legal authority and institutional power to assert dominance.

↓↓22Machado meets Trump at White House

 
Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters 
Elizabeth Frantz/ReutersVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado’s meeting with Donald Trump at the White House Thursday didn’t appear to shift the US president’s approach to Caracas’ leadership. Machado said she gave Trump her Nobel Peace Prize as she pushes for a democratic transition in Venezuela, but the White House “[made clear it was a courtesy meeting](https://semafor.com/s/t1lEzbWiRl?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” The Wall Street Journal wrote. Trump has [pursued a two-track strategy](https://semafor.com/s/mlnJSXL2vm?email=wschenk@gmail.com) of outreach to the opposition, while also pressuring — and at times praising — Caracas’ interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez. Both she and Machado are fighting to convince Trump… that [they are the right people](https://semafor.com/s/0lBuSo4iyV?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to lead,” El País wrote. The power struggle comes as US forces on Thursday [seized another sanctioned oil tanker](https://semafor.com/s/jyjjANKZeQ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in the Caribbean.

↓↓33Canada, China pledge closer ties

 
Canada and China pledged to expand energy ties on the first day of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s trip to Beijing. The countries are “at [a new starting point](https://semafor.com/s/a58z3ssN4T?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” after [years of tension](https://semafor.com/s/w0Qs1w9PMv?email=wschenk@gmail.com), China’s premier said. Carney, who meets Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday, is [pursuing a balancing act](https://semafor.com/s/We8utAhMlE?email=wschenk@gmail.com), though, as he seeks to [diversify Ottawa’s export markets](https://semafor.com/s/6seQI9F2y3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in the face of US protectionism without antagonizing Washington. Beijing’s warm reception for Carney also reflects Xi’s attempts to [court US allies](https://semafor.com/s/lxrvIJztjq?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that have been spurned by US President Donald Trump, analysts noted: The [UK and Germany’s leaders](https://semafor.com/s/WMXcVJspVV?email=wschenk@gmail.com) are poised to visit China in the coming weeks. But China’s [massive trade surpluses with Western economies](https://semafor.com/s/s1iUdBO3vY?email=wschenk@gmail.com) could hinder its efforts to pull them away from Washington.

↓↓44India’s exports hold up despite tariffs

 
Priyanshu Singh/Reuters 
Priyanshu Singh/ReutersIndia’s exports narrowly ticked up in December while its shipments to the US fell just 1% despite steep US tariffs, new data showed. India’s trade deficit widened but remains “[under control](https://semafor.com/s/Y3O3GR8Mml?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” as the country pivoted to China and Africa to diversify trading partners, an ING researcher wrote, noting that electronics have especially bolstered India’s exports. While some local media hailed the figures as proof that “the [fear of Trump’s tariffs has dissipated](https://semafor.com/s/t3JUHGcLAB?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” an Indian economics professor argued the data masks deeper vulnerabilities: Regional [economic divisions are quickly emerging](https://semafor.com/s/4CkMXlAKOk?email=wschenk@gmail.com), as the country’s South and West manufacture high-tech exports, while the North produces low-value agricultural goods and remains disconnected from global supply chains.

↓↓55US jobless claims fall

 
Vincent Alban/Reuters 
Vincent Alban/ReutersUS jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week to the lowest level in more than a month, keeping the cooling labor market on solid footing. Consumers, however, remain downbeat and [expect unemployment to rise](https://semafor.com/s/kowKlGyunc?email=wschenk@gmail.com) this year. Beyond the headline numbers, the manufacturing sector has emerged as especially vulnerable, experts noted: Manufacturing jobs have [declined every month](https://semafor.com/s/rFVIero1zW?email=wschenk@gmail.com) since President Donald Trump launched his 2025 tariff salvo, which the White House said would herald an onshore factory renaissance. “Global [supply chains took years to develop](https://semafor.com/s/YPpIoWYtj3?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” a Cato Institute economist wrote. “They’ll take even longer to reorganize [if] they don’t break altogether.”

↓↓66China probes travel giant

 
China’s antitrust watchdog opened a probe into travel giant Trip.com, part of Beijing’s campaign to stamp out aggressive competition that drives down prices. The investigation is a “[warning shot](https://semafor.com/s/sO4AL425jp?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” to businesses accused of abusing their strong market positions, Trivium China analysts wrote. Trip.com, whose [shares plummeted](https://semafor.com/s/FA5VxeFVNA?email=wschenk@gmail.com) Thursday, has fielded allegations of lowering hotel prices to undercut rivals; China’s food delivery platforms that waged a [race-to-the-bottom price war](https://semafor.com/s/GL05YTAKIi?email=wschenk@gmail.com) are facing similar scrutiny. The probes don’t signal a return to the [era of tech crackdowns](https://semafor.com/s/WJaXelcgkt?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that shook investor confidence five years ago, a Reuters columnist noted, partly because they’re not driven by founders falling out of grace with Beijing. “That makes [China](https://semafor.com/s/NIjrfuc7nq?email=wschenk@gmail.com)[’](https://semafor.com/s/NIjrfuc7nq?email=wschenk@gmail.com)[s antitrust regime more predictable](https://semafor.com/s/NIjrfuc7nq?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

↓↓77CEOs to keep spending on AI

 
Global CEOs expect spending on AI to double in 2026, as they remain confident about their investments paying off, a survey found. A BCG poll of 2,360 business leaders found that 94% of CEOs plan to continue investing in AI [even if there are no immediate returns](https://semafor.com/s/mCDW5KHz0r?email=wschenk@gmail.com) on their outlay in 2026. Their optimism is largely driven by the rapid development of AI agents — tech that can take autonomous action on a user’s behalf — the report said. The findings were not uniform, however: CEOs in India and China were more bullish on their AI investments than their counterparts in the US, UK, and Europe, many of whom said they were partly investing in AI to “avoid falling behind.”

↓↓88Big Tech scoops up commodity interests

 
Caitlin O’Hara/Reuters 
Caitlin O’Hara/ReutersAmazon is buying the US’ first new copper output in more than a decade to support its data center buildout, part of a wider Big Tech trend of acquiring energy and commodity interests higher in the supply chain. The AI boom is spurring demand for [copper and other precious metals](https://semafor.com/s/5ycQo2qNjB?email=wschenk@gmail.com) globally, and suppliers are eager to cash in: Saudi Arabia’s state-controlled mining company will [invest $110 billion](https://semafor.com/s/4WqD9EouVe?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in production over the next 10 years, its CEO told Semafor. Tech companies are also looking for creative ways to power their data centers. Microsoft pledged to [cover energy and water costs](https://semafor.com/s/rTTU39kg9N?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for its facilities, [Alphabet bought an energy infrastructure company](https://semafor.com/s/IiP1e7xQnr?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and Meta agreed to [purchase power directly from nuclear power firms](https://semafor.com/s/3vAS5WVX25?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓99Wind and solar surge in Uzbekistan

 
Maxim Shemetov/Reuters 
Maxim Shemetov/ReutersAn acute water shortage in Uzbekistan has crippled hydropower production but pushed the country toward wind and solar. The country saw significant declines in river inflows and reservoir levels, leading to a 20% drop in hydropower production last year. But [total renewable energy rose 29%](https://semafor.com/s/HyKIxLyYkc?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in 2025, the energy ministry said, as solar and wind generation more than doubled compared to the previous year; hydropower’s share of the energy mix fell from 10% in 2024 to 7.3% last year. The country plans to shift away from large-scale hydroelectric dams toward smaller generators on canals and irrigation systems, expanding electricity supply in rural areas without affecting water supply for agriculture, Eurasianet reported.

↓↓1010Dreaming of space-based solar power

 
Overview Energy 
Overview EnergyA startup beamed solar energy from a moving plane to the ground, a demonstration of the feasibility of doing so, one day, from space. Space-based solar energy is a longstanding dream: satellites in geosynchronous orbit, where the sun always shines and is not diluted by the Earth’s atmosphere, constantly sending energy down to the Earth. But while there has been progress, including transferring energy between satellites, it has never been shown to work from a moving platform to the ground. The test by startup Overview Energy only beamed a small amount of energy, but previewed “[the same methodology and function that we will take to space](https://semafor.com/s/I0QazBC6Ms?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” the CEO told IEEE Spectrum.

Purushottam Diwakar/The India Today Group via Getty ImagesIndian Railways will sunset its iconic bandhgala uniforms amid a push to stamp out colonial-era symbols, sparking a debate over the centuries-old garment. Also known as a Jodhpuri suit, the bandhgala originated in the principality of Rajasthani Jodhpur in the 16th century. Known for its closed neckline, fitted torso, and high collar for weathering harsh winters in the country’s north, the garment changed along with the subcontinent itself; first emerging in the Mughal court, it was later tailored for horse-riding and polo in the late 19th century. Around the same time, it was adopted by the national railway — replacing, ironically, a more European-style tunic. But throughout, “[the jacket itself always remained Indian](https://semafor.com/s/xGNGu9XUN7?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” a menswear designer told The Guardian.
