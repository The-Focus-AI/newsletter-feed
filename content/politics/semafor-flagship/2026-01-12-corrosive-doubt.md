↓↓11US probes Fed chair Powell

Kent Nishimura/File Photo/ReutersUS authorities launched a criminal investigation into the head of the country’s central bank, sparking political furore and driving investors into haven assets like gold. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell characterized [the move](https://semafor.com/s/j0M3BSTbwH?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — over the renovation of the bank’s building — as part of efforts to [stifle the Fed’s independence](https://semafor.com/s/uF094DpEoS?email=wschenk@gmail.com): President Donald Trump has repeatedly complained that policymakers have not cut rates aggressively enough and has floated firing Powell. News of the probe drew backlash in Washington, including from Republican Senator Thom Tillis. “If there were any remaining doubt” that the Trump administration sought to politicize the Fed, “[there should now be none](https://semafor.com/s/kB9AFix21W?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” he posted, adding he would block confirmation of Powell’s successor, due in May, until the issue was resolved.

↓↓22US weighs Iran response

 
Social media via Reuters 
Social media via ReutersUS President Donald Trump said Washington was planning a possible intervention over Iran’s crackdown against anti-government protests. More than 500 people are reported to have died as the regime — weakened by sanctions, economic stagnation, and recent attacks by the US and Israel — moved against the demonstrations, [the most serious threat against the authorities in years](https://semafor.com/s/vbMOTGzOIN?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Tehran has blocked internet access, but footage of widespread protests, including chants of “death to the dictator,” has made it out. Trump said the attacks on protesters could lead to “[very strong options](https://semafor.com/s/ckrYlpfWK2?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” but that Iran wants to negotiate: Among the cards Tehran has to play would be to close the Strait of Hormuz, a key thoroughfare for much of the world’s oil.

↓↓33US to ease Venezuela oil sanctions

 
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the White House was preparing to lift more sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry as soon as this week. Bessent’s remarks — alongside the potential release of billions of dollars of World Bank and IMF funds [to revive Caracas’ economy](https://semafor.com/s/yeVW4izdM3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — come with the US also pressing major oil companies to ramp up investments in the country, which has the world’s largest stated crude reserves. However, some oil majors have expressed reservations about working in Venezuela: US President Donald Trump said [Exxon, for example, could be sidelined](https://semafor.com/s/DBJbPJYyDW?email=wschenk@gmail.com), after its CEO said the South American country was “uninvestable,” and Trump in effect told ConocoPhillips’ CEO to [drop its effort to recover $12 billion](https://semafor.com/s/NGwzTE8ToZ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) it says it is owed by Venezuela.

↓↓44BRICS+ countries run naval drills

 
China, Iran, and Russia conducted naval exercises in South African waters over the weekend, operations Pretoria said were a response to rising maritime tensions. The week-long exercises — which include other BRICS+ members that US President Donald Trump accuses of pursuing “anti-American” policies — were fiercely criticized by many politicians in South Africa: One of the parties in the governing coalition said they “[contradict [the country’s] stated neutrality.](https://semafor.com/s/FGjWdxk838?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” They also illustrate the balancing act South Africa is attempting to carry out on the global stage, aiming to defuse widening tensions with Washington over trade and Pretoria’s support for genocide charges against Israel over the Gaza war, while maintaining strong ties with, for example, Beijing, its biggest trading partner.

↓↓55UK, Germany seek to protect Arctic

Danish military drills in Greenland. Guglielmo Mangiapane/File Photo/ReutersBritain and Germany are discussing how to bolster NATO’s military presence in the Arctic, in a bid to deter Russian aggression and fend off US President Donald Trump’s threat to take over Greenland. Washington’s rhetoric over a potential assault on the Danish territory has been given greater credence by its capture of Venezuela’s president, and European leaders are scrambling to respond. They want to show that [they have the Arctic’s security under control](https://semafor.com/s/JVAX713sbS?email=wschenk@gmail.com), Bloomberg reported, and are seeking to undermine Trump’s arguments for annexing Greenland. The Arctic is of growing strategic importance, both as a source of minerals and, as the seas warm and ice melts, as a shipping route from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

↓↓66Japan looks to sea for rare earths

 
Japan launched the world’s first deep-sea trial for mining rare earths, as the global race to secure access to the key metals heats up. Japan and much of the West have moved to diversify the supply and refining of rare earths — crucial for the manufacture of cars, electronics, and military equipment — [away from China](https://semafor.com/s/JiEeCMgCwD?email=wschenk@gmail.com) after Beijing threatened to cut off US-bound supplies amid a trade dispute with Washington. In response, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to push other G7 nations to [accelerate efforts](https://semafor.com/s/1b7Hxx6XEU?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to reduce their reliance on China when he hosts finance officials today. The G7 accounts for roughly 60% of global demand, while China makes up [more than two-thirds](https://semafor.com/s/42VP3YF89J?email=wschenk@gmail.com) of global supplies.

↓↓77ICJ hears Myanmar genocide case

 
Piroschka van de Wouw/Reuters 
Piroschka van de Wouw/ReutersThe International Court of Justice today opens hearings into charges Myanmar committed a genocide against a mostly Muslim minority group. [The three-week case](https://semafor.com/s/LXj999Wps5?email=wschenk@gmail.com) centers on the Myanmar authorities’ 2019 offensive against the Rohingya population, in which hundreds of thousands were driven into neighbouring Bangladesh alongside reports of mass killings, rapes, and other acts of violence. The trial — the first that the ICJ has taken up in full in more than a decade — has ramifications that extend far beyond Myanmar: The allegations were brought by The Gambia, which took the lead [alongside a number of Muslim countries](https://semafor.com/s/NjRhRT5U8l?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in pushing for the case; and the verdict could have significant consequences for South Africa’s genocide case against Israel over the Gaza war.

↓↓88Moderna chair warns of ‘dystopia’

 
Noubar Afeyan. Guglielmo Mangiapane/Reuters 
Noubar Afeyan. Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersThe politicization of science is undermining the scientific method itself, the co-founder of the biotech firm Moderna warned. In his annual shareholder letter, Noubar Afeyan noted that science had created “man-made miracles,” from the lightbulb to anti-HIV drugs. But, he said, the US — traditionally the driving force for scientific research — had backed away, cutting funding and restricting researchers’ visas. “[Corrosive doubt](https://semafor.com/s/h77A5aM3qY?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” has, he said, led to the return of measles in the US and elsewhere, as leaders “reject not only science but common sense.” We live simultaneously in “the utopian age” in which a baby with a deadly genetic condition can be cured, and a “dystopia” where the same baby can die of a disease eradicated decades ago, he added.

↓↓99Amazon offers Novo’s GLP-1 pill

 
Amazon Pharmacy [began offering Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy](https://semafor.com/s/DUpmorZ8TR?email=wschenk@gmail.com) weight-loss pill, a move likely to intensify the drug’s impact on waistlines, grocery bills, and the food industry as a whole. The Danish drugmaker hopes the new oral version could revive its fortunes, with its share price and profits flagging in the last year. Novo might be struggling, but GLP-1 drugs have had a profound impact: New research suggested that when US patients go on the drugs, [household grocery spending drops an average 5.3%](https://semafor.com/s/Jb0RrsfmEh?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and spending on fast food falls further. The drugs appear to be [the key reason that US obesity peaked in 2022](https://semafor.com/s/hEnxIW6GUc?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and the boss of [the much-loved UK fast-food chain Greggs](https://semafor.com/s/1E9qnrXDK6?email=wschenk@gmail.com) said GLP-1s have hit the company’s bottom line.

↓↓1010Rubens’ two-in-one masterpiece

 
Klaas Muller/BRAFA Art Fair 
Klaas Muller/BRAFA Art FairA painting bought at auction in 2023 turned out to be by Peter Paul Rubens — and to contain a hidden image when turned upside down. The artwork sold at a discount, at less than $117,000. But the buyer, a Belgian art dealer, suspected — correctly — it was by the 16th-century Flemish master; he recognized the model from other works. Further investigation revealed that when the painting was turned over, another face appeared, that of a young woman in the old man’s beard. The double image was likely not a deliberate illusion, but evidence of recycling: [Rubens probably painted over an earlier work](https://semafor.com/s/vxnQTJFq16?email=wschenk@gmail.com), The Guardian reported, adding that Rubens’ works usually sell for over $500,000.

Labor savingEverything we value needs both capital and labor to produce: The struggle between the two has occupied economists since at least Marx. Traditionally, the power balance between them has been self-correcting. When there is more capital — lots of hammers, say — the demand for labor goes up, because you need more hands to wield the hammers. But [AI might be about to change that](https://semafor.com/s/FVUBDuh16e?email=wschenk@gmail.com), argue Philip Trammell and Dwarkesh Patel in an essay that has driven huge debate within Silicon Valley.If the economy is fully automated, with all work done by robots and AIs, the self-correction breaks. Capital becomes a substitute for labor rather than a complement, and workers become redundant. When the economy transitions to all-AI, Trammell and Patel say, those who own capital — and their heirs — will capture almost all the wealth, leaving the rest as bystanders in the new economy; poor countries, whose main economic strength is cheap labor, will be worst hit. They propose progressive taxes to prevent the creation of a permanent underclass.Capital fellowsTrammell and Patel are not the only people interested in AI’s effect on the capital-labor power balance. The pseudonymous blogger Philosophy Bear notes that capitalists — the owners of capital — usually have two roles: To own stuff, but also to make decisions about deploying it. But those decisions can be automated by AI. [That would leave capitalists in an awkward position](https://semafor.com/s/29svsP9qec?email=wschenk@gmail.com), says Bear: They can no longer argue that their brilliant decision-making justifies their wealth. If AI did then entrench all the wealth in a few hands, as Trammell and Patel fear, there would be immense pressure on governments to take the capital out of private hands altogether.The other usual arguments against doing that — for example, that nationalization would wreck the economy, and that curtailing private ownership means curtailing freedom — would be weakened. Governments can use the same AIs to make economic decisions as capitalists can, and most of the population would be economically powerless and thus hardly free anyway in the world Bear (and Trammell and Patel) envision. Capitalists would face a fight to maintain their position, and could seek military power to do so, or be forced to rush AI development (a decision with many risks) in an attempt to win that fight.Over the moonThe idea of AI collapsing the traditional capital-labor balance is widespread — as well as Trammell/Patel and Philosophy Bear, there’s [a piece in The New Yorker](https://semafor.com/s/pJhFj5RcWa?email=wschenk@gmail.com) and various other Substacks warning that it will create a “permanent underclass.” But the AI-obsessed blogger Scott Alexander thinks the problem is overstated — or rather, in the world which these pieces describe, the outcomes are much more likely to be either “total annihilation of humanity” or “infinite post-scarcity society for all.” Between those two outcomes, he says, “there is, I admit, a tiny shoreline of possibilities that end in oligarch capture.”But even then, he says, regular people will be fine. Several of the oligarchs in question have already pledged that they will give 10% of their total wealth to the less fortunate. In a universe in which a few trillionaires claim all the value generated by the AI transformation of the economy, “[your worst-case scenario is owning a terraformed moon in one of [Dario Amodei’s] galaxies](https://semafor.com/s/tVQBIHUoNf?email=wschenk@gmail.com).” The “permanent underclass” meme is preying on the insecurities of well-off people in Silicon Valley, “who fret about how they’re just bourgeois well-off rather than future oligarch well-off, and that only the true oligarchs will have a good time after the Singularity.”– Tom Chivers

Shabnam by Syed Mujtaba Ali. This Bengali novel, drawing on the author’s experiences in Kabul in the 1920s, was recently translated and published in English. Afghanistan at the time was turbulent, having gained independence from Britain, and Indian independence campaigners — such as Ali — were drawn there. Shabnam is a love story between one such campaigner and the eponymous Afghan woman, but also [a mystical exploration of Afghan legends and literature](https://semafor.com/s/KJ3O183pLd?email=wschenk@gmail.com), according to the academic Shirazuddin Siddiqi in the Afghanistan Analysts Network.
