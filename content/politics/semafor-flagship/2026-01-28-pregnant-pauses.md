↓↓11Fed holds interest rates steady

 
The US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, signaling a pause after three straight cuts last year. Despite intensifying pressure from US President Donald Trump to lower borrowing costs, the Fed suggested it [isn’t in a rush](https://semafor.com/s/toJzCYMFNf?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to trim rates given low layoffs and steady economic growth. The widely expected decision followed “a very [boring meeting during very interesting times](https://semafor.com/s/99fBfjmwCB?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” one analyst said. Tuesday marked Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s first press conference since he revealed that the central bank is the [subject of a federal probe](https://semafor.com/s/HM8wqHj6yw?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Trump is gearing up to announce his pick to succeed Powell, whose term ends in May: BlackRock executive Rick Rieder has [emerged as a frontrunner](https://semafor.com/s/A9hwh7lZIb?email=wschenk@gmail.com), with traders betting on more aggressive cuts.

↓↓22Rubio: Caracas to submit budgets to US

 
Jonathan Ernst/Reuters 
Jonathan Ernst/ReutersThe US’ top diplomat detailed how the US will control Venezuela’s finances, less than one month after Washington ousted Nicolás Maduro. Secretary of State Marco Rubio testified to a Senate committee that Caracas will have to [submit a monthly budget](https://semafor.com/s/Rnp5EHyY12?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and the Trump administration’s review will determine how the funds from oil proceeds [can be spent](https://semafor.com/s/XXeRklJeqo?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The unusual arrangement has drawn comparisons to Iraq’s reconstruction, in which the US took control of Baghdad’s oil fund and [lost track of $8.7 billion](https://semafor.com/s/Tmc3zb8pAi?email=wschenk@gmail.com), Politico noted. One leader of the Iraq rebuilding effort called on Trump to use the oil revenues to pay dividends to Venezuela’s citizens, “preventing old Maduro cronies [from looting the country’s wealth](https://semafor.com/s/mh5Ckv2auM?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

↓↓33China OKs Nvidia H200 chip sales

 
Florence Lo/Reuters 
Florence Lo/ReutersChina began allowing purchases of Nvidia’s powerful H200 chips for the first time, pointing to a nascent US-China rapprochement ahead of a planned visit by President Donald Trump in April. The first Nvidia approvals went to three of [China’s tech giants](https://semafor.com/s/Xa9rL7Fish?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent — Reuters reported, after the US greenlit their exports last month. It was previously unclear whether [China would allow the sales](https://semafor.com/s/OqvC9Nd67C?email=wschenk@gmail.com) given its push for high-tech self-sufficiency, but the approval suggests the “[extreme hunger for high-quality computing power](https://semafor.com/s/iwKydExYE4?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” from China’s tech scene is taking priority, a Taiwan-based expert said.

↓↓44Executives join Starmer in Beijing

 
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is bringing a cavalcade of business leaders with him on his trip to China this week, as he pursues a reset with the world’s second-largest economy. Executives from top [British banks and manufacturers](https://semafor.com/s/bodUkh7jqD?email=wschenk@gmail.com) are joining Starmer, who plans to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday with a goal of [unlocking more export business](https://semafor.com/s/o27pykiMaB?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for UK firms. But Starmer is walking a tightrope in enhancing trade ties with Beijing while trying not to rile US President Donald Trump, who has [threatened Canada with tariffs](https://semafor.com/s/9j4CIe2bHu?email=wschenk@gmail.com) if Ottawa strikes a broad deal with China. Trump’s shakeup of global commerce has driven more US allies toward Beijing: [German investments in China](https://semafor.com/s/0aLVedcT8Z?email=wschenk@gmail.com) hit a four-year high last year.

↓↓55More Chinese students at UK unis

 
Jaimi Joy/Reuters 
Jaimi Joy/ReutersTwo out of every five overseas students at top UK universities came from China, new data shows. Almost [105,000 Chinese students attend elite “Russell Group” schools](https://semafor.com/s/NgQno8t1VL?email=wschenk@gmail.com), a record 42.5% of their international population, the Financial Times reported. A major income source, the swell of students highlights the risks associated with relying on a single recruitment market. To wit, the US higher education system is having the opposite experience. Although America remains a top destination for students coming from China, [numbers have been falling for years](https://semafor.com/s/EdYEWwIDgB?email=wschenk@gmail.com): Chinese students in American schools fell by 4% to 265,000 in the 2024-25 school year, as the two countries’ relations worsened.

↓↓66Trump touts kids’ savings accounts

 
Kevin Lamarque/Reuters 
Kevin Lamarque/ReutersUS President Donald Trump on Wednesday touted his administration’s plan to invest in newborns’ bank accounts, with backing from a suite of financial giants. Parents who enroll will receive $1,000 from the government to [seed their baby’s account](https://semafor.com/s/1raUrFitCq?email=wschenk@gmail.com); that money will be invested in the stock market by private firms, and can be accessed [when the child turns 18](https://semafor.com/s/M6nD6xOgqQ?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Other countries, including the UK, Hungary, and Singapore, have enacted similar programs, though some studies have shown they have limited economic benefits: The UK’s program ran from 2002 to 2011, and while 6.3 million accounts were opened, nearly half went unclaimed. “There was [little evidence of the scheme](https://semafor.com/s/hTUxJrvaTz?email=wschenk@gmail.com) creating savings habits overall,” one study found.

↓↓77Nipah virus outbreak in India

 
Suvarnabhumi Airport Office/Handout via Reuters 
Suvarnabhumi Airport Office/Handout via ReutersA cluster of cases of the deadly Nipah virus in India caused nearby countries to step up screening measures, although New Delhi said it had the outbreak under control. Nipah, first detected in 1999, is usually found in bats and pigs, but occasionally breaks out into humans. There’s no vaccine for the virus, which can lead to fevers, brain swelling, and respiratory illness. It can spread person-to-person, but only via fluid contact, and so is less contagious than airborne diseases like COVID. It is, however, extremely deadly — up to 75% of cases are fatal — and so [Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Thailand](https://semafor.com/s/U2qOK8kmu9?email=wschenk@gmail.com) began temperature checks for incoming passengers.

↓↓88Europe ramps up weapon production

 
Europe is building weapons and ammunition at its fastest pace in decades as it aims to manage its defense independently of the US. German defense giant Rheinmetall has been building a slew of new factories since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and will soon make more 155mm artillery shells than the entire US defense industry. Italy’s Leonardo has increased its headcount by nearly half. Europe spent $560 billion on defense last year, twice what it spent a decade ago, and by 2035 its spending will be equivalent to 80% of the Pentagon’s. Although the continent still relies on the US for [satellite support, advanced fighters, and long-range drones](https://semafor.com/s/mtVLjWSMdj?email=wschenk@gmail.com), The Wall Street Journal reported, the pivot toward defense self-reliance is well under way.

↓↓99Ukraine leads in battle bots

 
Stringer/Reuters 
Stringer/ReutersUkraine has become the world leader in unmanned ground vehicles. Like their aerial counterparts, UGVs “[do not become tired, cold, [or] scared](https://semafor.com/s/2VQQEnePzC?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” and already provide critical frontline logistics and medevac support, The Jamestown Foundation noted. Though fully mechanized assault brigades remain theoretical, UGVs are also increasingly serving in combat roles: This week, Ukraine captured [the first footage of Russian troops surrendering](https://semafor.com/s/eNd9KGqIPS?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to a UGV. Kyiv approved 330 unique models in 2024 — a 350% increase from the year before — almost all of which are manufactured by Ukrainian defense firms, for now outpacing Moscow’s reverse-engineering of Kyiv’s tech. “We don’t have the men to counteract Russia’s [assaults],” one manufacturer told the Economist. “So we’ll [send our own zombies against theirs](https://semafor.com/s/eptfZ7CUR2?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

↓↓1010Zimbabwe inflation hits single digits

Shaun Jusa/Xinhua via Getty ImagesZimbabwe’s annual inflation rate fell to single digits this month for the first time since 1997. Authorities hailed the 4.1% reading as a “[historic milestone](https://semafor.com/s/8D2kI0Ki80?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” after decades marred by hyperinflation and currency collapse: [Inflation hit 89.7 sextillion percent](https://semafor.com/s/uZIqhdiY56?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in 2008. The deflationary shift follows the rollout of central bank policies aimed at stabilizing prices since the country’s gold-backed currency was launched in 2024 — Harare’s [sixth attempt since 2009](https://semafor.com/s/YAenY25f4J?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to replace the US dollar as the nation’s main form of tender. Across Africa, policymakers are trying to ease inflation to stabilize currencies, restore investor confidence, and rebuild household purchasing power.

Effingers, by Gabriele Tergit. This 900-page novel of Jewish life in the Weimar Republic, published in 1951, went largely overlooked until a German critic launched a revival of Tergit’s work in the 2010s. This is the first English translation of her opus, which follows a young German Jewish woman born to an upper class family, who — [similar to Tergit herself](https://semafor.com/s/LXbGhZryWs?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — leaves Berlin after Adolf Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, never to return. “Full of parties and drama and delicious gossip, and featuring a kaleidoscopic cast of characters, Effingers is a [keenly observed account of German Jewish life](https://semafor.com/s/O3xbcBkrqM?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in all its richness and complexity,” New York Review Books wrote.
