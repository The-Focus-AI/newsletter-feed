↓↓11US-Europe spat over Greenland escalates

 
Mads Claus Rasmussen/Ritzau Scanpix/via Reuters 
Mads Claus Rasmussen/Ritzau Scanpix/via ReutersUS President Donald Trump said he would impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries that oppose his efforts to take over Greenland, eliciting a forceful response from the continent. Trump’s threat reflects his penchant for [wielding his economic arsenal](https://semafor.com/s/YPqfpFgCir?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for foreign policy means — even against longstanding allies — after countries including Germany, France, and the UK sent troops to the autonomous Danish territory last week. The eight tariff targets warned of a “[dangerous downward spiral](https://semafor.com/s/HEa6YBEMAT?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” while the EU is considering retaliation: The French president urged the bloc to deploy its trade “bazooka,” a tool initially [conceived to fend off China](https://semafor.com/s/LPd1uzM4ro?email=wschenk@gmail.com). “We either fight a trade war, [or we’re in a real war](https://semafor.com/s/9QXFwyTcNK?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” a Bruegel fellow said.

↓↓22Nations hedge against US protectionism

 
Sean Kilpatrick/Pool via Reuters 
Sean Kilpatrick/Pool via ReutersMajor world economies stung by US President Donald Trump’s protectionist turn struck landmark trade deals in a bid to expand market access and forge new strategic alliances. Canada opened the door to Chinese EVs [in return for lower tariffs](https://semafor.com/s/B7Br2of8le?email=wschenk@gmail.com) on key Canadian agricultural products, marking a major policy shift for Ottawa and a reset between the two countries after years of poor relations. “[The world has changed](https://semafor.com/s/OmdRFcohgo?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said in Beijing, and a “new world order” is taking hold. The EU and the Mercosur bloc of South American nations on Saturday [signed a free trade agreement](https://semafor.com/s/vNApIG8VWq?email=wschenk@gmail.com) after 25 years of negotiations. The pact is “a symbolic rebuttal to [the narrative of inevitable deglobalization](https://semafor.com/s/bX4CWHyNUc?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” a Brazil expert argued.

↓↓33Global elite descend on Davos

 
Government leaders and top executives will descend on the Swiss Alps starting Monday for the annual World Economic Forum, the bastion of globalization under strain amid a tumultuous geopolitical landscape. Davos’ theme this year, “A Spirit of Dialogue,” feels like “[a heroic stretch](https://semafor.com/s/HEhTGzG1oH?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” The Guardian wrote, given US President Donald Trump’s reordering of global trade, expansionist agenda, and hostility toward allies. Trump will remain the center of gravity this week as he [leads a massive US delegation](https://semafor.com/s/j00uzTCYDq?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to Davos. But while the WEF no longer shapes the global agenda — the “[Davos consensus](https://semafor.com/s/3pSOGGZxqn?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” is often wrong, Semafor’s Liz Hoffman notes — the event remains influential by giving powerful people [a place to schmooze](https://semafor.com/s/OwjrGtXRdH?email=wschenk@gmail.com) and strike deals, a former devotee wrote.
A group of Semafor editors is in Davos and will be reporting and hosting events all week — [subscribe to Semafor’s pop-up Davos briefing](https://semafor.com/s/f4ctJduylm?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for updates and insights. →

↓↓44Permanent Board of Peace seat costs $1B

 
Dawoud Abu Alkas/Reuters 
Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersCountries will have to cough up $1 billion for a permanent seat on US President Donald Trump’s new “Board of Peace,” documents show. The international body, chaired by Trump, was conceived to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza — US officials recently announced the [beginning of phase two](https://semafor.com/s/Cu24t9koru?email=wschenk@gmail.com) of the territory’s peace plan — but the [group’s charter](https://semafor.com/s/ooyrRaa3P8?email=wschenk@gmail.com) suggests the Board of Peace will have a more [global remit](https://semafor.com/s/ZO93MBYGFN?email=wschenk@gmail.com). That could [set it up for a conflict with the UN](https://semafor.com/s/KODnfN0Vet?email=wschenk@gmail.com), which Trump has repeatedly criticized. Trump also risks igniting tensions with Israel, which voiced concern over the [makeup of a Gaza-focused committee](https://semafor.com/s/N0zgpkCJPf?email=wschenk@gmail.com) under the Board of Peace: It includes a Turkish minister but no Israeli officials.

↓↓55China ramps up discipline

 
Maxim Shemetov/Reuters 
Maxim Shemetov/ReutersChinese Communist Party enforcers last year punished nearly a million people as leader Xi Jinping stepped up his corruption crackdown and sought to tighten control. Xi has overseen [high-level purges](https://semafor.com/s/Va1DjbTi19?email=wschenk@gmail.com) stemming from graft allegations, but the widespread discipline, which includes suspension, demotion and expulsion, suggests he “[still wants more commitment](https://semafor.com/s/NC48HhzgIo?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to his agenda,” The Wall Street Journal wrote. A state media outlet noted Xi wants to see “[intensified](https://semafor.com/s/HeZtFjDjDO?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” anti-corruption efforts to enforce a forthcoming five-year economic blueprint. It’s a pivotal time for the world’s second-largest economy, as China grapples with a lopsided reliance on exports over domestic consumption: [Fourth-quarter GDP growth](https://semafor.com/s/gQhVAwRv9N?email=wschenk@gmail.com) was likely weak, and its trade surplus recently [hit a record $1.2 trillion](https://semafor.com/s/T3GzxdcqDP?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓66AI agent pushes down software stocks

Screenshot/Claude CoworkThe release and viral success of an AI-powered office agent pushed down software stocks and showed how much AI startups are challenging the incumbent tech sector. Anthropic’s new Claude Cowork tool — itself developed with the help of AI — allows users to quickly [build apps, edit and organize files](https://semafor.com/s/wDRD3OYnYK?email=wschenk@gmail.com) on their computer, and sort through data. It represents “just the type of capabilities that [software] [investors have been fearing](https://semafor.com/s/Ty6ElKuk67?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” Bloomberg wrote. Software-as-a-service stocks are down 15% this year — Intuit had its worst week since 2022 — exacerbating the gulf between software makers, which haven’t seen much traction from AI features, and tech giants that have ridden the AI wave to record valuations.

↓↓77Ads are coming to ChatGPT

 
Florence Lo/Reuters 
Florence Lo/ReutersOpenAI will introduce advertisements to ChatGPT as the $500 billion startup hunts for new revenue ahead of a potential IPO. OpenAI said its [ads will be labeled](https://semafor.com/s/OSTfIY4bWG?email=wschenk@gmail.com) and that bot responses would not be influenced by advertisers, which won’t be able to access user chats. The pivot comes one month after CEO Sam Altman declared a company-wide “code red” to focus on improving the core user experience amid competition from Alphabet’s Gemini and [Anthropic’s new Claude Code tool](https://semafor.com/s/dlgDjNaV6l?email=wschenk@gmail.com). OpenAI must “[raise funding at a near-constant pace](https://semafor.com/s/MpQ1q7nxRw?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” to stay afloat, [The Wall Street Journal](https://semafor.com/s/RWpm0QP7E2?email=wschenk@gmail.com) noted, a disadvantage compared to some deep-pocketed rivals. In 2024, Altman said that introducing ads on ChatGPT would be a “[last resort](https://semafor.com/s/u7V9BHdZgJ?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

↓↓Mixed SignalsMixed Signals 
Sarah Rogers, the State Department’s undersecretary for public diplomacy, joins Mixed Signals for a wide-ranging conversation about free speech, tech regulation, and why she’s been rattling the patience of some European governments. Max and Ben press her on confronting Europe over X, the Digital Services Act, and online speech — including accusations that she’s carrying water for Elon Musk and the far right. Rogers traces her worldview back to the early internet, Gawker comment sections, and First Amendment litigation, and explains why she sees today’s speech rules as potentially dangerous.

↓↓88China and Russia dominate nuclear push

 
China and Russia accounted for 90% of the world’s nuclear plants that began construction last year, as enthusiasm builds over the energy source. The countries are “[expanding their influence](https://semafor.com/s/69izheEdlw?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” through the plants, in part by building them in emerging countries, Nikkei reported. In the US — which has more reactors than any country but trails in building new ones — President Donald Trump has [prioritized building nuclear reactors](https://semafor.com/s/hwZ715VRzD?email=wschenk@gmail.com) as AI drives a staggering demand for electricity. American companies are [racing to build new types of facilities](https://semafor.com/s/81gWywQz6j?email=wschenk@gmail.com), including small modular reactors, and New York state announced last year that it is [planning to build a nuclear plant](https://semafor.com/s/wCxUUUeClU?email=wschenk@gmail.com), its first in decades.

↓↓99Chinese schools surge in rankings

Xie Shangguo/Xinhua via Getty ImagesChinese universities have surged in global research rankings as the US federal government slashed funding. Harvard, until recently the world’s most productive academic institution, fell to third in rankings that emphasize the volume and quality of research that universities produce; Zhejiang University is No. 1, with seven other Chinese colleges in the top 10. [US research output has gone up](https://semafor.com/s/DD6S1TPpJD?email=wschenk@gmail.com), but Chinese schools’ output has risen more, The New York Times reported. Funding cuts are relevant, but so is Beijing’s huge investment. Chinese research is [disproportionately likely to be retracted for fraud or errors](https://semafor.com/s/WO5I45atHu?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and Chinese researchers [cite one another’s work](https://semafor.com/s/Ilux5t5kPw?email=wschenk@gmail.com) at a higher rate than Western scientists, suggesting a gaming of the system.

↓↓1010Flu hits harder this season

 
Hannah McKay/Reuters 
Hannah McKay/ReutersThis year’s flu season is especially bad because the dominant strain is highly mutated and harder for our immune systems to detect. The US, UK, and other countries have seen a wave of hospitalizations, with case numbers and severity above average. This season’s flu vaccine is also not well-matched to the dominant strain, a subtype that has not been widespread in years, although [research suggests that the vaccine still protects against severe illness](https://semafor.com/s/wXnC69Xm2l?email=wschenk@gmail.com), Nature reported. The US recently [stopped recommending flu shots](https://semafor.com/s/QCXOfVzAQw?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for children, which pediatricians warned could make things worse: [289 children](https://semafor.com/s/7f9Prz9Ccv?email=wschenk@gmail.com) were reported to have died of the virus last season, Scientific American reported. Of those who died and had a known vaccination status, only one in 10 was vaccinated.

Yara Nardi/ReutersA wet and rainy UK winter has produced bumper sales for canine cold-weather clothiers. “Mini-me” dressing, formerly just for parents who wanted matching outfits for themselves and their children, is now for pets — a trend likely helped by couples in many wealthy countries choosing to have fewer children. Barbour, Carhartt and Ralph Lauren offer matching dog-and-owner outfits, and Burberry and Louis Vuitton have included dog models in campaigns. Thanks to social media, pups are now “[the ultimate fashion icons](https://semafor.com/s/adRqUKqAqC?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” the editor-in-chief of Dogue magazine told The Guardian. Owners are pampering their pets in other ways: “Dog-first” airline Bark Air is partnering with hotels to deliver a “holistic” experience that offers more than “[a dog bed and a water bowl](https://semafor.com/s/MVrILqdURm?email=wschenk@gmail.com) upon arrival,” an executive told Monocle.
