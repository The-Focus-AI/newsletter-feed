↓↓11Stocks tumble on Greenland uncertainty

 
US stocks suffered their worst day since October on Tuesday as transatlantic tensions flared over US President Donald Trump’s efforts to seize Greenland. The dramatic rout — which also saw the dollar fall, while [long-term Treasury bond yields](https://semafor.com/s/byrMOQnGoy?email=wschenk@gmail.com) ticked up — suggested traders’ willingness to shrug off geopolitical shocks “is [beginning to erode](https://semafor.com/s/wFvw8SdlpA?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” Bloomberg wrote. Trump’s use of tariff threats for territorial gains, rather than a domestic economic goal, is new, making the potential fallout more unpredictable. “A country will [tolerate a lot of economic misery](https://semafor.com/s/7dQV1QamKQ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) rather than giving up territory,” The Wall Street Journal’s economics commentator argued. Another round of tariffs, coupled with European retaliation, could reignite fears of a US slowdown, while [denting Europe’s GDP](https://semafor.com/s/azfCuI6eF9?email=wschenk@gmail.com), Goldman Sachs analysts said.

↓↓Semafor Exclusive22US foreign debt a vulnerability

 
Firebird Films/Semafor 
Firebird Films/SemaforThe $9 trillion of US debt owned by foreign countries is an “[enormous vulnerability](https://semafor.com/s/bxzj7hK048?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” for Washington, Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio told Semafor in Davos, as nations in Donald Trump’s crosshairs look for ways to oppose his expansionist agenda. The billionaire hedge-fund manager’s warning came as [global investors appeared spooked](https://semafor.com/s/GRXJF0iXeA?email=wschenk@gmail.com) by Trump’s threats to take Greenland. Denmark’s largest pension plan is [selling off its $100 million](https://semafor.com/s/jLzprQeEuC?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in US Treasury bonds — a move it insisted wasn’t political — while bond giant Pimco is [pivoting away from US assets](https://semafor.com/s/8urinYJHxT?email=wschenk@gmail.com). “The case for global diversification [has never been stronger](https://semafor.com/s/A7Ajjy6R6M?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” a top investment executive said Tuesday. A former US Treasury official, though, argued he was “less apocalyptic” about other countries using US debt load as a cudgel.

↓↓33Europe urged to stand up to Trump

 
Marko Djurica/Reuters 
Marko Djurica/ReutersEurope must swap flattery for firmness in responding to Donald Trump’s campaign over Greenland, several prominent European voices argued. Even as some EU leaders sought to appease the US president following his tariff threats, the US president [appeared to mock their diplomatic efforts](https://semafor.com/s/BVF7n11MHT?email=wschenk@gmail.com) by sharing their text messages. He declared Tuesday there’s “no going back” on his Greenland quest — but Europe “must call Trump’s bluff or risk being [bullied into irrelevance](https://semafor.com/s/S0oUBKI58R?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” a veteran British editor argued; a Financial Times columnist echoed it was “[more dangerous to roll over](https://semafor.com/s/wQUI1J0B2J?email=wschenk@gmail.com)… than to fight back.” Despite the risks that forceful economic retaliation carries, “history tells us [that] polite appeasement [can have far greater consequences](https://semafor.com/s/TlYNsJAs1B?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” Denmark’s former leader noted.

Carl Court/Getty ImagesThe UK on Tuesday approved plans for China’s new mega-embassy in London, smoothing the path for Prime Minister Keir Starmer to visit China later this month. The 700,000-square-foot building faced pushback from some [British and American politicians](https://semafor.com/s/OSlh1QmMhQ?email=wschenk@gmail.com), citing national security risks, particularly fears of espionage. But in greenlighting China’s biggest embassy in Europe, Starmer is betting on “winning [closer trade ties and investment](https://semafor.com/s/QYAYUymn6e?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” from Beijing, Reuters wrote. His expected visit to China would be the first by a British leader since 2018, and comes as Beijing looks to capitalize on US-fueled geopolitical disruption to [repair and deepen its overseas relationships](https://semafor.com/s/bCWsisD3hw?email=wschenk@gmail.com). China is hosting a stream of Western leaders, and France’s president said at Davos that Europe [needs more Chinese investment](https://semafor.com/s/8LHtppZ379?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓55New Delhi widens trade partnerships

 
India is pursuing new trade partnerships as a US deal remains elusive. New Delhi on Tuesday inked a major LNG deal with the UAE, with [plans to double bilateral trade](https://semafor.com/s/Jr7TnBXRTJ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to $200 billion by 2032. And the European Commission president, who is set to visit India next week, said the two economies are on the cusp of clinching “[the mother of all deals](https://semafor.com/s/dYXEy9FsKl?email=wschenk@gmail.com).” US-India negotiations, meanwhile, have hit [several snags](https://semafor.com/s/kqw7E0ZKAr?email=wschenk@gmail.com), as New Delhi looks to diversify trade following steep US duties. President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats against Europe over Greenland offer New Delhi a lesson, an expert told The Times of India: Deals with the US [offer no guaranteed protection](https://semafor.com/s/MAmgBSMwIm?email=wschenk@gmail.com) when economic penalties can be used as leverage.

↓↓66China solar giants warn of record loss

 
China’s top solar panel companies estimated they lost up to $5.5 billion last year despite the government’s efforts to rein in a punishing price war. The country’s solar installations have surged but were [outpaced by a massive supply glut](https://semafor.com/s/tRJzNFw5wm?email=wschenk@gmail.com); the companies’ quest for profitability will test the effectiveness of Beijing’s campaign to stamp out so-called “involution,” excessive competition that has plagued other domestic industries. The solar sector is also facing [headwinds from rising silver costs](https://semafor.com/s/1kumJKx1MK?email=wschenk@gmail.com). China’s aggressive renewable energy push has seen cheap green power spill beyond its borders, and the “[bizarre dynamics have spread](https://semafor.com/s/TPN8Sfp2Df?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” with it, WIRED wrote: Chinese solar panels, for instance, have led to [negative electricity prices](https://semafor.com/s/ddrYhCmYzQ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in Germany.

Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters 
Valentyn Ogirenko/ReutersUkrainian energy companies are concerned that crises over Venezuela and Greenland are siphoning political oxygen as Kyiv tries to hammer out energy deals with the US. Ukraine’s top energy leaders met in Davos on Tuesday, as Russia’s overnight strikes on the country’s energy infrastructure [cut off heating to half of Kyiv](https://semafor.com/s/u9AYM1dUOq?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Ukraine [still needs much more Western financial support](https://semafor.com/s/qIMrSV8BJw?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to rebuild and buy more imported gas, especially from the US. President Donald Trump is due to meet with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Davos and discuss Kyiv’s recovery, but the mood in the energy sector is bleak. “Now Ukraine is not No. 1, or even No. 5, on the agenda,” a gas CEO told Semafor.

↓↓88Inequality, mental health links dubious

A major analysis of existing literature casts doubt on the link between inequality and mental health. There is a longstanding claim that economic inequality, over and above absolute wealth, harms societies by leading to increased status anxiety: The 2009 book The Spirit Level argued that its knock-on effects included worsening crime and chronic disease. But the new research, examining 168 studies totaling 11 million participants around the world, found that people in more unequal societies did not report lower well-being. Previous studies concluded the opposite, owing to significant publication bias, the researchers suggested: Work finding a null result tended not to be published. The authors argued the research implied that [absolute rather than relative poverty should be the target of policy](https://semafor.com/s/qHytt8cnGA?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓99Finland’s icebreakers in demand

 
The warming of the Arctic is good news for the Finnish shipbuilding industry. Finland is the “undisputed world leader” in icebreaker manufacturing and design, the BBC reported: It is the only country in the world where all harbors freeze in winter, and icebreakers keep those ports open in the coldest months. Accordingly, [80% of all currently operating icebreakers were designed in Finland](https://semafor.com/s/1IA4L0bxvp?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and 60% were built there. Reduced Arctic ice levels are opening up trade routes and access to oil and gas fields, with countries, including the US, [scrambling for control](https://semafor.com/s/yvmitKSTaj?email=wschenk@gmail.com) of the region. President Donald Trump recently [waived a rule](https://semafor.com/s/eqpJZBG9Yc?email=wschenk@gmail.com) requiring the Coast Guard use US-built ships, and ordered four Finnish-made icebreakers alongside seven domestically built but Finnish-designed ones.

↓↓1010Drivers exploit ‘historic’ vehicles

 
Kevin Lamarque/Reuters 
Kevin Lamarque/ReutersFinancial benefits afforded to US drivers of “historic” vehicles have led to a surge in titles claiming that designation — and a corresponding crackdown. In the state of Maryland, historic plates are cheaper than ordinary ones, and offer exemptions for emissions tests and safety inspections. The $65 in annual savings motivated one owner of a 2005 Toyota Camry to register his vehicle. “I wouldn’t call it historic,” he told The Wall Street Journal. Lawmakers last year tightened the category to cars dating prior to 1999, outraging some, including the owner of a 2001 Panoz Esperante — a rare make that won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race — who hopes for a repeal: “[Why should the innocent be punished for the guilty?](https://semafor.com/s/Hdio57Vi3E?email=wschenk@gmail.com)”

David Mareuil/Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesJapan’s winter has ushered in the return of Mount Zao’s juhyo, or “snow monsters.” Near-constant blizzard conditions prevail on Zao’s slopes, applying layer upon layer of snow and ice that yield legions of “[eerily biomorphic](https://semafor.com/s/VkwogprakV?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” frost-covered fir trees, The Asahi Shimbun wrote. The monsters appear to be slimming down, however, as temperatures rise and the forest is thinned by predatory bark beetles, threatening a tourism-dependent economy. Locals are now springing into action with fir transplantations underway, but the trees take 50 to 70 years to mature, meaning restoration will be an intergenerational project requiring “[patience and continuity](https://semafor.com/s/wyzhAQCQEh?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” a conservation specialist told the BBC.
