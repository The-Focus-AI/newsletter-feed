Jonathan Ernst/File Photo/ReutersUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy headed to Davos for talks with US President Donald Trump over stalled negotiations with Russia, which has maintained a brutal offensive leaving hundreds of thousands without power and heating. Zelenskyy initially said he would stay home because of the fallout from Moscow’s assault on Ukrainian energy infrastructure — the country’s parliament and half the capital lack heating, with temperatures [plummeting to -10°C](https://semafor.com/s/4LSf26rQSM?email=wschenk@gmail.com)[ (14](https://semafor.com/s/4LSf26rQSM?email=wschenk@gmail.com)[°](https://semafor.com/s/4LSf26rQSM?email=wschenk@gmail.com)[F)](https://semafor.com/s/4LSf26rQSM?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — and as the conflict was overtaken by Washington’s Greenland threats. But Trump said he would meet his Ukrainian counterpart, while his own envoy, who is set to meet with Russia’s president today, hailed progress in the talks, saying they were “[down to one issue](https://semafor.com/s/A4ND0tOh0y?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” between Ukraine and Russia.

↓↓22US eyes Cuba regime change

 
The US is reportedly aiming to overthrow Cuba’s regime this year, apparently emboldened by its ouster of Venezuela’s leader. Washington believes Havana’s Communist government, which has ruled for seven decades, has never been weaker, with the economy — which relied heavily on Venezuelan oil donations — [on the verge of collapse](https://semafor.com/s/6RDjHYcdbn?email=wschenk@gmail.com), The Wall Street Journal reported. Compounding Cuba’s challenges is the fact that some of its allies, including China, Mexico, and Russia, are facing economic problems of their own. Though many have long predicted the regime’s fall, this “chapter of history… [may be coming to a close before our very eyes,](https://semafor.com/s/c9R5jsbos0?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” the editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly wrote.

↓↓33Europe mulls next steps over Greenland

 
US President Donald Trump touted “the framework of a deal” over Greenland, but details remained scarce, leaving European leaders voicing relief but unsure of next steps. Trump had previously threatened tariffs and potential military action; EU leaders are set to discuss the plan today. [The agreement’s outlines remain unclear](https://semafor.com/s/gIDXHczewu?email=wschenk@gmail.com), but potentially involve rights to Greenland’s minerals and increased NATO presence. Reaching a final deal will be “[hard work](https://semafor.com/s/ljmL4AWZ0D?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” one Atlantic Council analyst said, but Europe may have more leverage than widely assumed: While the continent needs US military might, [the US needs European territory for its bases](https://semafor.com/s/RziX2VE6n3?email=wschenk@gmail.com), World Politics Review noted.

↓↓44Trump’s peace board takes shape

 
Denis Balibouse/Reuters 
Denis Balibouse/ReutersThe US-created “Board of Peace” was signed into existence at Davos, although concerns have emerged over who is on it and, equally, who isn’t. President Donald Trump invited leaders of 60 nations onto what he called “the most prestigious board ever formed,” and dozens have said yes. Trump himself will be chair for life, and the initiative signals his desire to rewrite the international order with [himself at the center](https://semafor.com/s/6vmLb3mWHH?email=wschenk@gmail.com), The New York Times said. Inaugural members include “three ex-Soviet apparatchiks, two military-backed regimes, and [a leader [wanted for] war crimes](https://semafor.com/s/zoj0iuHiZH?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” the Financial Times noted. [A key group that is missing is the Palestinians](https://semafor.com/s/2sF3F2fH9q?email=wschenk@gmail.com), The National reported, notable given the Board’s original aim of brokering peace in Gaza.

Semafor Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith interviewing Gavin Newsom at WEF. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty ImagesUS global leadership is “in dormancy” but not dead, California Governor Gavin Newsom told Semafor’s Ben Smith at Davos on Thursday. Newsom — widely seen as the frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination — called US President Donald Trump an “invasive species” defined by “corruption and graft at a scale we’ve never seen in American history,” but rejected the prevailing Davos view, articulated by Canada’s prime minister, that Trump represents a historic “[rupture](https://semafor.com/s/z3sqYTP1J0?email=wschenk@gmail.com).” Newsom’s remarks on stage at the World Economic Forum come with Trump facing growing domestic pushback over his [economic, immigration](https://semafor.com/s/TjcfsWt2Bs?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and foreign policies from voters and [even among fellow Republicans](https://semafor.com/s/vlfa0G8OW6?email=wschenk@gmail.com), particularly over his aborted effort to annex Greenland.

↓↓66China seeks economic jump-start

 
China announced a [$72 billion state-backed loan guarantee](https://semafor.com/s/yfRt4NgjQq?email=wschenk@gmail.com) program aimed at boosting flagging private consumption. Experts have long urged Beijing to increase domestic demand in order to rebalance its investment- and export-dependent economy: China ran a record $1.2 trillion global trade surplus last year. Persistent signs of deflation, trade tensions with the US, and flatlining growth appear to have pushed Chinese authorities to accelerate what had previously been lackluster efforts to do so. Beijing has “[no choice](https://semafor.com/s/nYe0qNhgKx?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” but to shift to local consumption, a former deputy governor of China’s central bank said in Davos, while the country’s vice premier has vowed to turn it into “[the world’s market](https://semafor.com/s/5mXnbM026W?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” in order to reduce trade imbalances.

↓↓77China’s shifting Africa strategy

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Tingshu Wang/Pool/File Photo/ReutersChinese lending to Africa plummeted, new data showed, as Beijing shifted its focus to strategic investments on the continent. Total lending in 2024 amounted to $2.1 billion, [down by more than 90% from its 2016 peak](https://semafor.com/s/N0JJQ3oLpI?email=wschenk@gmail.com), a Boston University report showed. The pivot partly reflects the poor performance of previous loans, after several African nations defaulted. In response, Beijing recalibrated its engagement with the continent, pursuing investments in strategic projects — notably in energy, mining, and transportation — amid an intensifying rivalry with Washington. Chinese financing through the Belt and Road Initiative reached a record last year, with “[Africa emerging as [a] key beneficiary,](https://semafor.com/s/qaBnOhheAr?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” Beijing mouthpiece China Daily reported.

↓↓88Billions face ‘water bankruptcy’

 
Two-thirds of the US is facing unusually dry winter weather or drought. This season has seen record-low snowfall and warm conditions across the West, [bad news for the ski industry](https://semafor.com/s/mJIElGNIZe?email=wschenk@gmail.com), but also for the months ahead. Water supply relies on snowmelt, and wetter landscapes reduce fire risk. The US is not alone. The UN warned that three-quarters of people worldwide face water shortages, water contamination, or drought, as they use more than their annual allowance of rainwater and snowmelt, draining their groundwater supplies, [a condition the report calls “water bankruptcy.”](https://semafor.com/s/8b8M4YiuFC?email=wschenk@gmail.com) For better or worse, the immediate US problem may be short-lived: A winter storm is due this weekend, with meteorologists warning of “[crippling amounts](https://semafor.com/s/FYWxLRziYl?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” of snow and freezing rain.

↓↓99UK to fund AI in research

 
Toby Melville/Reuters 
Toby Melville/ReutersThe UK is funding startups and universities using AI to design and run experiments. Britain’s Advanced Research and Invention Agency wants AI to run the entire scientific procedure from hypothesis generation, via designing and running experiments, to analysis of the results, with human scientists setting the initial questions; [it has funded 12 such projects from the UK and elsewhere](https://semafor.com/s/oe9UFxIPdT?email=wschenk@gmail.com), MIT Technology Review reported. AI has undeniably sped up science — DeepMind’s AlphaFold revolutionized the study of proteins — but may change its direction, too: A recent study of 40 million papers found that AI use made individual scientists more productive, but tended to channel researchers into similar areas of study, [reducing the breadth of science’s output](https://semafor.com/s/nW94jo4auw?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓1010Blue Origin’s broadband ambitions

 
Jeff Bezos’ rocket company Blue Origin announced a satellite broadband network to rival SpaceX’s Starlink. TeraWave’s constellation will still be far smaller than Starlink’s — the Elon Musk-backed company already has 9,400 in orbit, and plans thousands more. But it is a sign that SpaceX’s near-total dominance of the private space sector is [facing genuine challenges](https://semafor.com/s/ji0bEftwRz?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Blue Origin also successfully landed a rocket booster, making it the only non-SpaceX actor capable of reusable space flight. Another rival is Bezos’ very own Amazon: Its Leo broadband venture has 180 satellites already and 3,000 more planned. [China is also looking to develop its own service](https://semafor.com/s/tfYxX4tp65?email=wschenk@gmail.com), with two state-backed companies leading Beijing’s efforts, although they remain years behind.

Sentimental Value, directed by Joachim Trier. This Norwegian movie, about a filmmaker turning family tragedy into art, was the big winner at the European Film Awards this week. It is “[quietly devastating](https://semafor.com/s/mVj7hEf86O?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” according to Deutsche Welle, and its central performance has “[Stellan Skarsgard is at his absolute best](https://semafor.com/s/bAD8VaI4Wb?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” per The Irish Times. It was already the subject of significant Oscar buzz, and given the Academy’s longstanding love for movies about movies (see: Birdman, La La Land, The Artist), it can surely expect at least a few nominations. Watch Sentimental Value at a theater near you.
