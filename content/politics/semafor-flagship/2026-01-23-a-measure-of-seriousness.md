NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and Donald Trump. Jonathan Ernst/ReutersSpeeches and shifts by Western leaders this week cemented a growing fracture in the transatlantic alliance. NATO fended off a crisis over US President Donald Trump’s threats to annex Greenland, but several European leaders have [raised](https://semafor.com/s/qQXbNYXkF5?email=wschenk@gmail.com) [questions](https://semafor.com/s/eex2fAQc52?email=wschenk@gmail.com) over the details of a “framework” deal between Washington and NATO. A top EU official, meanwhile, said bloc members had “[serious doubts](https://semafor.com/s/GBjVAWWSMb?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” about Trump’s Board of Peace — ostensibly meant to oversee a ceasefire in Gaza but which European leaders worry is aimed at challenging the UN; [Washington withdrew Ottawa’s invite](https://semafor.com/s/9EEsf7Kgwx?email=wschenk@gmail.com) following a speech by Canada’s leader articulating a “rupture” in global politics. Germany’s chancellor echoed that sentiment, warning at Davos that the “old world order is [unraveling at a breathtaking pace](https://semafor.com/s/sb4hb7srBN?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

↓↓22China pursues new trade allies

 
China scored big trade wins as the US pushed ahead with its protectionist moves. Beijing [reached agreements with the EU and Canada](https://semafor.com/s/skKRrLKJ13?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to allow more Chinese-made electric vehicles into both markets, while Britain’s prime minister [will travel to China soon](https://semafor.com/s/rcR2aOSos2?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to revive business cooperation. Germany’s chancellor is also [expected to visit next month](https://semafor.com/s/dPBYRSzTtx?email=wschenk@gmail.com). US President Donald Trump’s speech at Davos this week reiterated he would keep tariffs in place, affirming Washington’s retreat from the helm of a free-trade liberal order, The New York Times argued: Beijing is keen to assume that mantle, and despite its repressive surveillance state and military expansionism, it is “at least rhetorically” invested in [the rules-based, multilateral model](https://semafor.com/s/rwu7ePqzHx?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that Trump has denounced.

↓↓33LatAm exports to China soar

 
Latin American exports boomed last year despite US tariffs, with many nations increasing their reliance on China as their biggest goods market. Since the start of his second term, US President Donald Trump has vowed to outmuscle China in the Western Hemisphere, part of [his “Donroe Doctrine” of regional dominance](https://semafor.com/s/hzBfl9uljm?email=wschenk@gmail.com). But Washington’s levies, paired with Beijing’s insatiable appetite for commodities such as metals, beef, and soy, have only strengthened Latin America’s ties with the Chinese economy while helping reduce its exposure to US policy changes. The shift is [reshaping geopolitics](https://semafor.com/s/kc8kJPxbc2?email=wschenk@gmail.com), Bloomberg reported: Trump’s moves have deepened China’s footprint, and even some of the White House’s closest regional allies recently [boosted trade ties to Beijing](https://semafor.com/s/it7HH04BPF?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓44Europe investors not likely to flee US

 
Analysts and economists downplayed the possibility of foreign investors exiting US assets en masse, in large part because they have few other options. [A Danish pension fund](https://semafor.com/s/JDVlEJ0KAg?email=wschenk@gmail.com) and [a major global bond investor](https://semafor.com/s/lfm8rgNLEl?email=wschenk@gmail.com) said this month they were diversifying away from US bonds, spurring President Donald Trump to threaten “[big retaliation](https://semafor.com/s/ETXXbm2QRZ?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” were Europeans — cumulatively the largest holders of US Treasurys — to dump them. But if European nations did try, the sheer size of the American market means they would [struggle to reallocate those resources elsewhere](https://semafor.com/s/M0HEj4iHU0?email=wschenk@gmail.com), a former Federal Reserve vice-chair noted on the Foreign Affairs podcast. And a fire sale could end up [harming European investors even more than Washington itself](https://semafor.com/s/Q4KCqXrre2?email=wschenk@gmail.com), the Financial Times warned.

↓↓55Russia, Ukraine, US to meet for talks

 
Thomas Peter/Reuters 
Thomas Peter/ReutersRussia, Ukraine, and the US will hold talks in Abu Dhabi today. The meeting, which officials said would be the first trilateral talks since Moscow’s 2022 invasion, comes after a US envoy met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, and Washington and Kyiv agreed to postwar security guarantees. All sides will send senior negotiators, in what the BBC called “[a measure of the seriousness of the talks](https://semafor.com/s/jEhfY1uDGM?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” but there are sticking points, notably the Kremlin’s demand that Ukraine give up 25% of the Donetsk region, still partly controlled by Kyiv. The EU is also looking to the postwar period: The European Commission said a multi-billion-dollar plan to rebuild Ukraine and integrate it into the EU single market was “[close to an agreement](https://semafor.com/s/AtN2RzUsRP?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

↓↓66Delcy consolidates power

 
Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters 
Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/ReutersVenezuela’s interim President Delcy Rodríguez moved to strengthen her grip on power as she faces domestic and foreign threats. She has shaken up the country’s military, long the basis of power for the ruling Socialist party, replacing [at least half a dozen top officials](https://semafor.com/s/wMu1SxKCfK?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Rodríguez has also responded to US pressure by fast-tracking a law to open the state-controlled oil sector to private and foreign investment. The move appears to have worked on at least one person: US President Donald Trump, who has pressed global oil companies to invest tens of billions of dollars in Venezuela in order to tap the nation’s huge crude reserves, said Rodríguez was showing “[very strong leadership.](https://semafor.com/s/Bgha4O44HT?email=wschenk@gmail.com)”

↓↓77Anthropic vows to protect humanity

 
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei. Denis Balibouse/Reuters 
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei. Denis Balibouse/ReutersAnthropic updated Claude’s “Constitution,” spelling out the chatbot’s “ethical character” and, crucially, requiring it not to “kill or disempower” humanity. [The Constitution](https://semafor.com/s/B2ksPM8YPU?email=wschenk@gmail.com) is baked into Claude’s thinking; previous versions were softer guidelines, but as Claude becomes more powerful, [its maker has added constraints on dangerous behavior](https://semafor.com/s/LKomYpUulm?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Sci-fi fans might be reminded of Isaac Asimov’s Laws of Robotics, banning robots from harming humans, a near-impossible task with traditional programming because “harm” is ill-defined; natural-language AIs, though, can understand the instruction despite its fuzziness, making something like the Laws possible. Of course, as in Asimov’s stories, there will still be tensions. Claude itself noted to Flagship that its instruction to be “honest” will sometimes conflict with its instruction to do no harm.

Stephen Dubner has spent 20 years proving that things aren’t what they seem — and now he’s not so sure that’s always true. The coauthor of Freakonomics and host of one of podcasting’s most enduring shows by the same name joins Ben and Max to talk about why he never sold to Spotify, how The New York Times shifted from telling readers things to telling them what to think, and his new self-funded TV experiment that’s “like laundering podcast money.” Along the way, Dubner explains how he accidentally got sucked into the Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni gossip vortex (Candace Owens was involved), makes the case for prediction markets over pundits, and reveals why he’s now considering buying a pizza place with a Michelin-starred chef.Listen to the latest Mixed Signals now.

↓↓88African solar gets huge boost

 
The World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation vowed to spend [tens of millions of dollars](https://semafor.com/s/CXoDcJmBci?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to accelerate Africa’s solar energy sector, which has taken off in recent months. Despite enormous solar power potential, the continent generates just 2% of its electricity from solar, around a third of the global average. Falling hardware prices and rising efficiency have led to a boom in microsolar projects across the continent, though: Nigeria imported more than 1,700 megawatts of solar panels last year alone, enough to meet [around 5% of the country’s electricity demand](https://semafor.com/s/Iaxokj1uiS?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The continent’s panel imports almost tripled in the two years to June 2025, energy think tank Ember said, proving that “[a take-off in solar in Africa is now here.](https://semafor.com/s/vJ5Afb1kK9?email=wschenk@gmail.com)”

↓↓99Gas prices spike ahead of US storm

 
US natural gas prices [rose 75% in three days](https://semafor.com/s/hpUwUgZ0w3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) as the country braced for a huge Arctic storm. Much of the East Coast and Midwest expect snow and sleet, with travel likely to be disrupted. Heavy snow and subzero temperatures in big cities will drive heating demand, and the cold will also hit Texas’ oil-and-gas fields, which could “[wreak havoc on the power grid](https://semafor.com/s/PnZ7zWndKn?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” The Wall Street Journal reported. Washington ordered grid operators to use backup electricity generation from alternative sources, such as data centers and factories — an unusual move, the WSJ noted, since they do not usually distribute energy to the grid, and it is [unclear whether the plan could work at short notice](https://semafor.com/s/D6oZvYLVGl?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓1010Hollywood’s horror embrace

 
Sinners director Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan. Kylie Cooper/Reuters 
Sinners director Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan. Kylie Cooper/ReutersRyan Coogler’s Sinners broke the record for the most Oscar nominations ever. Its 16 beat the 14 previously held by All About Eve, Titanic, and La La Land. The blues-tinged vampire story’s domination continues an ongoing horror revival — Frankenstein received nine nominations, although Guillermo del Toro missed out on a Best Director nod, and Weapons’ Amy Madigan is up for Best Supporting Actress, after last year saw five awards for the body-horror The Substance. Sinners’ main rival this year is One Battle After Another, Paul Thomas Anderson’s darkly comic blockbuster; the success of the two films is a return for “Hollywood’s most endangered species — [highly original, studio-made films with hefty budgets](https://semafor.com/s/gVH4rlTDwA?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” The New York Times noted.

H is for Hawk by Helen Macdonald. A movie adaptation of this 2014 memoir is out today, so perhaps it is a good time to read the original. Macdonald, a historian, lost her beloved father, and retreated into isolation, before deciding to raise and train a goshawk. It is written with “words that mimic feathers, so impossibly pretty we don’t notice their astonishing engineering,” and yet remains “[messy, muddy, and raw,](https://semafor.com/s/hHEDcvCXeF?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” The New York Times wrote at the time.
