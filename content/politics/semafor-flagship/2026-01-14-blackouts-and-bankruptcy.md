The prime ministers of Greenland and Denmark. Liselotte Sabroe/Ritzau Scanpix/via/ReutersGreenland’s prime minister said the self-ruled territory would not join the US, and would instead remain part of Denmark despite Washington’s threats of annexation. In response to Jens-Frederik Nielsen’s comments, US President Donald Trump said “[that’s going to be a big problem for him.](https://semafor.com/s/PAKds5Uife?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” Despite polls showing the vast majority of Greenlanders are against becoming part of the US, Trump has repeatedly vowed to take over the territory, which, if he got his way, would make it Washington’s [biggest-ever land acquisition](https://semafor.com/s/idcEEu7C2o?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The diplomatic spat came ahead of today’s [high-stakes meeting](https://semafor.com/s/4I59lqhDVe?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in Washington between the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark, the US secretary of state, and the US vice president, Bloomberg reported.

↓↓22Trump hits back at Dimon over Fed

 
Jamie Dimon. Marco Bello/Reuters 
Jamie Dimon. Marco Bello/ReutersUS President Donald Trump rebuked Jamie Dimon for criticizing the administration’s criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The JPMorgan CEO had warned that [the probe could “chip away” at the Fed’s independence](https://semafor.com/s/UXMrzqn0eW?email=wschenk@gmail.com), echoing warnings from Republican lawmakers, among others. Trump has hitherto been friendly with Wall Street, but his pressure on the central bank has drawn concern. He has sought to dismiss another Fed governor, and repeatedly called for rates to be cut, eroding the bank’s independence. In part, Trump’s demands are driven by voters’ affordability concerns that threaten to undermine his popularity: He has also called for banks to cap credit-card interest rates at 10%, potentially costing banks [$100 billion a year](https://semafor.com/s/w5VcwuqmHA?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓33China reports $1.2T trade surplus

 
China reported a record $1.2 trillion trade surplus last year, an indication the world’s second-biggest economy is weathering US tariffs. While shipments to the US have plummeted, exports to Africa, Europe, and Southeast Asia surged in 2025, feeding anxiety that local industries [may be decimated by cheap Chinese imports](https://semafor.com/s/sf1Kx1ChI6?email=wschenk@gmail.com). President Donald Trump has vowed to boost Chinese purchases of US products, and when asked if Chinese markets could open to US goods, said he thinks “[it’s going to happen](https://semafor.com/s/nIcOQiUrly?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Canada’s prime minister will also look to boost Chinese purchases of Canadian goods — [which tumbled by more than 10% last year](https://semafor.com/s/0QflHCQbXH?email=wschenk@gmail.com) — during his visit to Beijing this week.

↓↓44Brazil risks US tariffs with Iran trade

 
Amanda Perobelli/File Photo/Reuters 
Amanda Perobelli/File Photo/ReutersBrazil’s $3 billion trade surplus with Iran risks making it a target of US tariffs, potentially reversing a recent rapprochement between Brasília and Washington. US President Donald Trump this week threatened 25% levies on any country doing business with Iran, pledging support for widespread anti-government protests that have gripped the country for days. Last year, the US leader [threatened 50% tariffs on Brazil](https://semafor.com/s/QawfbZxGrM?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in response to what he said was the unfair prosecution of former Brazilian president and Trump ally Jair Bolsonaro. But after meeting his Brazilian counterpart, Trump changed course, easing levies on Latin America’s biggest economy. Now, however, Brazil’s multi-billion dollar agricultural trade with Tehran [could land it back in Washington’s crosshairs](https://semafor.com/s/iK1OVjAtMH?email=wschenk@gmail.com), Reuters reported.

↓↓55Iranians sidestep internet blackout

 
IRIB via WANA(West Asia News Agency) via Reuters 
IRIB via WANA(West Asia News Agency) via ReutersIranians are seeking, with some success, to bypass the regime’s internet blackout amid the country’s deadliest protests in years. The country’s walled-off web is supposed to prevent citizens from seeing non-approved content, [but is leaky](https://semafor.com/s/JvhZ3bUq3f?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and during the recent unrest, Tehran tried to cut off access altogether. Iranians, though, have found ways around it, notably SpaceX’s Starlink, whose direct-to-satellite broadband is hard to block; there are [thousands of Starlink receivers](https://semafor.com/s/amEZ8QMDLE?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in Iran. [The government is trying to jam it](https://semafor.com/s/rUfidV8qOI?email=wschenk@gmail.com), with some success, Ars Technica reported, while the Elon Musk-owned company is trying to bypass those measures. SpaceX has reportedly [made Starlink access free in Iran](https://semafor.com/s/K5tlfMQLv0?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and [US President Donald Trump has asked Musk](https://semafor.com/s/Z5WIPAvTSc?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to work on boosting Iranians’ internet access.

↓↓66Uganda blocks internet ahead of vote

 
Uganda blocked internet access ahead of this week’s presidential election, as octogenarian Yoweri Museveni seeks to extend his four-decade rule. Authorities in Kampala said the blackout would prevent the “weaponization of the internet” ahead of Thursday’s vote, but critics say the move is intended to weaken potential protests if the election results are contested. Though opposition candidate and pop singer Bobi Wine has built a large following among Uganda’s young population, experts say Museveni — who has ruled with an iron fist since 1986 — [looks set to win a seventh presidential term](https://semafor.com/s/rWs4m2uJ2R?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Regardless, Wine has vowed to fight on: “[They’ll see me broken but they’ll never see me give up,](https://semafor.com/s/GqUUcTT81m?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” he told The New York Times.

↓↓77Boeing orders outpace Airbus’

 
New Boeing orders outnumbered Airbus ones for the first time this decade, as airlines worldwide seek to placate Washington by buying American. Boeing has had a nightmare few years, with two deadly crashes and one near-catastrophe on its flagship 737 Max airliner since 2018. But US regulators eased restrictions in a sign of growing confidence, and airlines upped their order numbers — albeit partly “[to ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration](https://semafor.com/s/gzloqN4PlA?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” the Financial Times argued. The company booked 1,075 orders last year compared to 1,000 for its chief rival. The air industry in general is booming: Delta Air Lines [forecast a 20% profit jump this year](https://semafor.com/s/Jh47FWl3ws?email=wschenk@gmail.com), driven by high-end customers.

↓↓88Saks files for bankruptcy

 
Kylie Cooper/File Photo/Reuters 
Kylie Cooper/File Photo/ReutersSaks Global filed for bankruptcy, the latest sign of the ongoing struggles high-end department stores are facing. The company owns the iconic US luxury outlet Saks Fifth Avenue, and in 2024 pushed through a $2.7 billion merger with fellow retailers Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. But the deal left it with $2 billion debt, and profits are down as it struggles to compete with e-commerce rivals. The department store landscape has “[changed irrevocably](https://semafor.com/s/x548CNvoZc?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” The New York Times reported; brands sell directly to consumers, via the web or through their own stores, meaning Saks’ “biggest suppliers are also their biggest competitors.” Demand for luxury goods has also been uneven, with [a strong period of growth ending last year](https://semafor.com/s/wijYCDi78X?email=wschenk@gmail.com), McKinsey said.

↓↓99The ripple effect of Dutch pensions

 
Piroschka van de Wouw/Reuters 
Piroschka van de Wouw/ReutersThe reform of Europe’s biggest pension system may soon begin making it more expensive for the continent’s nations to borrow. The Netherlands this month started [shifting its retirees](https://semafor.com/s/3klnZhgbEy?email=wschenk@gmail.com) from plans in which retirement income is guaranteed to ones where payouts are dependent on how much an individual put in, alongside market performance. The pivot is key to making the country’s pensions program sustainable, but its impact will be felt farther afield: Dutch pension funds hold around €2 trillion, or $2.3 trillion, in assets, and were incentivized to buy long-term bonds in order to [ensure certainty of payouts](https://semafor.com/s/QTvjQy0DEt?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The new system is likely to drive them into stocks, with the change expected to [push bond yields higher](https://semafor.com/s/AIZ6eMzkcU?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓1010Cancer patients are living longer

 
Five-year cancer survival rates in the US topped 70% for the first time, the American Cancer Society’s annual report found. That means that a person diagnosed with cancer is 70% as likely to be alive five years later as the average person. It represents steady progress: In the 1970s, the figure was 50%. Improved screening can confuse the issue — if someone’s cancer is diagnosed early, they will survive longer after that diagnosis even without treatment — but evidence suggests that there has been real progress in treatment. [Overall cancer incidence has remained broadly steady](https://semafor.com/s/UY5E7luYVd?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The ACS said many cancers had turned “[from a death sentence into a chronic disease](https://semafor.com/s/gzT2KSyFuE?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” but warned that progress is threatened by cuts in science funding.
