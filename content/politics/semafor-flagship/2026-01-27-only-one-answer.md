↓↓11Silicon Valley divide on response to ICE

 
Yves Herman/Denis Balibouse/Reuters 
Yves Herman/Denis Balibouse/ReutersHundreds of US tech workers are speaking out about the US’ deadly immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, but most of Silicon Valley’s top CEOs remain silent. OpenAI’s Sam Altman told employees that ICE operations are “[going too far](https://semafor.com/s/LwJgp0fmty?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” while Anthropic’s CEO characterized the situation in Minnesota as “horror” in a post. They couched their [condemnation with praise](https://semafor.com/s/BNtqYHFeTy?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for President Donald Trump, however, reflecting the [tightrope](https://semafor.com/s/NOAPNGq2fI?email=wschenk@gmail.com) tech chiefs are walking in responding to the unrest without drawing the White House’s ire. [More than 800](https://semafor.com/s/SxVLSgf4Al?email=wschenk@gmail.com) employees, including those from Google, Microsoft, and Meta, [called on their bosses to condemn ICE](https://semafor.com/s/fiICfVPpdq?email=wschenk@gmail.com), but many in AI would prefer staying quiet to “getting dragged into the [mind-killing field that is politics](https://semafor.com/s/KUXDX6zdg8?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” Transformer wrote.

↓↓22US consumer confidence falls

 
Sarah Silbiger/Reuters 
Sarah Silbiger/ReutersUS consumer confidence plummeted this month to its lowest level since 2014, a leading index showed, as Americans grew more anxious about high prices and a cooling job market. Even as the US economy [keeps growing](https://semafor.com/s/IVITTff3y2?email=wschenk@gmail.com) and inflation eases, the country has been stuck in a “low hire, low fire” labor environment, and the latest reading is a “[warning sign to policymakers](https://semafor.com/s/8ETxIQo0L2?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” to focus on affordability and reviving hiring, one economist said. Geopolitical shocks fueled by President Donald Trump’s volatile foreign policy also weighed on consumers, the survey showed. Trump on Tuesday hopes to refocus voters’ attention on his efforts to bring costs down in a speech in Iowa, a state whose [farming industry was hurt](https://semafor.com/s/hs1MhwagbW?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in the president’s trade war.

↓↓33Yen strengthens on intervention chatter

 
Japan’s currency strengthened Tuesday as speculation simmered that Japanese and US authorities could intervene after a sharp slide in the yen. Such a coordinated step — which could involve the US buying Japanese assets — is [rare and remains unlikely](https://semafor.com/s/6BWutgB7Vj?email=wschenk@gmail.com), analysts said. Unilateral moves by Tokyo are more likely: Last week’s sharp yen selloff was fueled by concerns over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s spending and tax cut proposals, and she is eager to get through a Feb. 8 snap election “[without markets blowing up](https://semafor.com/s/9FqErtdHsy?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” Bloomberg wrote. A Brookings economist, though, argued that the yen’s best hope is for the Japanese government to sell assets to pay down its debt, which is the highest among the world’s major economies: “The only way to get there… is for [things to get worse before they can get better](https://semafor.com/s/qApYM8vnQm?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

↓↓44Spending boosts growth but poses risks

 
Aggressive government spending in wealthy countries is propping up global economic growth, but poses a threat to long-term financial stability. From the US to Europe to Asia, countries are rolling out large stimulus packages financed by budget deficits, a trend that is expected to [boost growth and jobs](https://semafor.com/s/sSqZk1qroU?email=wschenk@gmail.com), The Wall Street Journal reported. But the record debt raises questions about the ability to weather future crises, and risks causing market turbulence: Japan’s bond market was roiled last week by concerns over government spending measures. “[The menace of unsupportable borrowing](https://semafor.com/s/oQAKDfPNvB?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” now looms over the global economy, The New York Times wrote. “The more you consume now, the less you can consume later,” an economist said.

↓↓55Positive signals on US-China biz ties

 
Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters 
Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersWashington’s top envoy in Beijing signaled business ties between the world’s two biggest economies are on more solid ground after their trade war truce last October. Ambassador David Perdue reportedly [told a closed-door meeting](https://semafor.com/s/BNHjzBKQFm?email=wschenk@gmail.com) of business leaders in Hong Kong that the US and China had made progress on several agreements, including a [massive Boeing sale](https://semafor.com/s/2I9x7ry9Th?email=wschenk@gmail.com), ahead of President Donald Trump’s expected trip to China in April. Perdue earlier told Bloomberg that the broader US-China relationship was “[improving multi-dimensionally](https://semafor.com/s/CG6uUFOsb4?email=wschenk@gmail.com).” Other Western nations are also pursuing closer ties with Beijing as Trump’s trade policies and unpredictable diplomacy [reshape global partnerships](https://semafor.com/s/ElWRQNLH19?email=wschenk@gmail.com): Finland’s premier visited China and pledged to [boost economic cooperation](https://semafor.com/s/HuQqGKnTVI?email=wschenk@gmail.com) on Tuesday, and the UK’s Keir Starmer lands in Beijing on Wednesday.

↓↓66Europe EV sales overtake gas cars

 
Fabian Bimmer/Reuters 
Fabian Bimmer/ReutersSales of all-electric vehicles overtook gasoline-only ones in Europe for the first time in December, boosted by an influx of low-cost Chinese models. The shift comes despite a 38% drop in Tesla sales in 2025 as the Elon Musk-owned carmaker lost ground in the continent to China’s BYD. The EU is also planning to allow [more China-made EVs](https://semafor.com/s/ydr8SD415D?email=wschenk@gmail.com) into Europe. EV sales also [boomed in the US](https://semafor.com/s/i1bq1kDwQH?email=wschenk@gmail.com) last year, but American automakers are [reining in electrification plans](https://semafor.com/s/6pVovrmfNh?email=wschenk@gmail.com) amid the Trump administration’s rollback of EV incentives. For Washington, the growth of EV trade elsewhere “should be taken as a [serious signal of future global trends](https://semafor.com/s/tOkoM5z4gB?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” a CSIS analyst argued.

↓↓77Firms factor Trump into takeover defense

 
US companies are stepping up efforts to contain the country’s “ultimate activist investor” — President Donald Trump, Semafor reported. The Trump administration’s $1.6 billion [investment in a rare earths miner](https://semafor.com/s/u5PvC4w7Oh?email=wschenk@gmail.com) this week was the latest example of such intervention to put CEO whisperers and takeover defense experts on notice. “There’s [really only one answer](https://semafor.com/s/FwpoGZdhlq?email=wschenk@gmail.com) when the president comes knocking,” so boardrooms must be prepared, one adviser said. Whether trying to fend off federal involvement or court it, the strategy is to have an aggressive DC ground game, corporate experts said. Firms have learned that avoiding the White House is no longer an option.

↓↓88Saudi shelves its massive cube project

 
Hamad l Mohammed/Reuters 
Hamad l Mohammed/ReutersSaudi Arabia halted construction of a massive cube-shaped skyscraper planned for downtown Riyadh, the latest blow to the kingdom’s glitzy development ambitions, Reuters reported. The Mukaab, a 400-meter by 400-meter metal cube, was billed the world’s largest structure, big enough to fit 20 Empire State Buildings. The reassessment of the [project’s financing and feasibility](https://semafor.com/s/V4QzIvv95b?email=wschenk@gmail.com) comes as Saudi also plans to scale back its flagship $1 trillion NEOM development and create a [new tier of management](https://semafor.com/s/pnVpRDbCFf?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to improve oversight of the megaproject, Semafor reported. Falling oil revenues have forced Riyadh to slash spending on flashy builds and shift focus to sectors with better near-term returns, like logistics, mining, and AI.

↓↓99Girls are hitting puberty earlier

Girls around the world are reaching puberty earlier. Girls got their first period, on average, around 16 in 1840. Today, it’s about 12. The average age of onset of breast development in the US fell from 11 in the 1960s to below 10 in the 1990s. The cause is unknown, although rising obesity is “[almost certainly playing a part](https://semafor.com/s/ctpSQEk3jd?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” Nature reported. Some scientists suspect hormone-disrupting chemicals in the environment, although evidence is mixed. The health impacts are unclear; some studies link precocious puberty to increased risk of conditions like breast cancer and heart disease, but causality is hard to establish. The change has driven the Endocrine Society to release new guidelines for girls on the border between typical and early puberty.

↓↓1010More doubt cast on microplastic studies

 
Marton Monus/Reuters 
Marton Monus/ReutersThe amount of microplastics in the air might be several orders of magnitude lower than studies have suggested. A new paper examined global microplastic emissions and recorded concentrations, and found that [previous models’ estimates were between 100 and 10,000 times higher than is plausible](https://semafor.com/s/MMFzOI04kC?email=wschenk@gmail.com). They suggested the problem may have been caused by over-extrapolation from limited data. The news follows other recent research and news reports that found that concentrations of microplastics in the human body may also be overestimated — not least because the methods used to detect them, including in the [popular paper](https://semafor.com/s/wB3JhL5qSD?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that claimed the average human brain contained enough plastic to make a teaspoon, [cannot reliably distinguish between plastic and body fat](https://semafor.com/s/12iglOwcrC?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

You and Me and the Others by Alfredo Jaar, at the Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery. This exhibition by the New York-based Chilean artist offers a critique of US hegemony, and Japan’s relationship with the US, in particular: Tomorrow is another day, a newly commissioned work, features two light boxes, one displaying a US flag that holds the dominant position over a similar box with a Japanese flag. Also on display are historical Jaar works addressing the Bosnian War and famine in 1990s Sudan. Underpinned by the notion that “[images and language are not neutral or innocent](https://semafor.com/s/7nIJdcfoVL?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” Jaar’s latest exhibition provides a “welcome tenor” in an art scene that often feels “strangled by insularity,” The Japan Times wrote.
