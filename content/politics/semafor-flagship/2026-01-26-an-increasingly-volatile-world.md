↓↓11White House reviews ICE killing

 
Tim Evans/Reuters 
Tim Evans/ReutersUS President Donald Trump said the White House was “reviewing everything” after a second protester was killed by federal agents in Minneapolis, but blamed “Democrat ensued chaos” for the violence. Alex Pretti was shot repeatedly on Saturday, apparently after having been disarmed. Federal officials defended officers’ actions but Trump [refused to say whether the agents acted appropriately](https://semafor.com/s/LXCjtz1Dyn?email=wschenk@gmail.com), The Wall Street Journal reported. He did, however, say immigration enforcement “at some point… will leave” the city. The operation to deport illegal migrants has [lasted almost two months and involves 3,000 agents](https://semafor.com/s/7weSY1WC1z?email=wschenk@gmail.com), CBS reported. Hundreds of local businesses closed Friday and thousands of people protested the ongoing crackdown in the wake of the fatal shooting of another demonstrator this month.

↓↓22US government shutdown looms

 
Kent Nishimura/Reuters 
Kent Nishimura/ReutersOutrage over the Minneapolis shooting and a winter storm in the US have raised the [likelihood of a partial government shutdown](https://semafor.com/s/07zIHdE3GY?email=wschenk@gmail.com). A recent funding agreement expires on Friday, and Democratic lawmakers — whose votes are necessary to pass any such legislation — [said they would not support](https://semafor.com/s/p6OAhraZKZ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) the package to replace it if it involved any appropriations for immigration enforcement, after federal agents killed a second citizen in Minneapolis. A recent shutdown ended when some Democrats revolted against the party whip, but one of the leaders of those rebels said he “can’t vote” for the funding package. The opening of the new legislative session was, meanwhile, [postponed by bad weather](https://semafor.com/s/IDGhhgX5j1?email=wschenk@gmail.com), narrowing lawmakers’ window for reaching an agreement.

↓↓33China’s war readiness questioned

 
Maxim Shemetov/Pool/Reuters 
Maxim Shemetov/Pool/ReutersTaiwanese authorities said they were monitoring “abnormal” changes at the top of China’s military after the stunning dismissal of the country’s leading general. Chinese leader Xi Jinping placed Zhang Youxia and another senior officer under investigation for corruption, an astonishing shakeup of military leadership: Zhang [reportedly leaked nuclear secrets](https://semafor.com/s/z3PNM8TNWI?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to the US. Taipei said it [was on alert](https://semafor.com/s/8XsxDICy87?email=wschenk@gmail.com) because the threat from the mainland, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, remained high. The move further consolidates power in Xi’s hands but raises “[doubts about the country’s war readiness](https://semafor.com/s/Y5bCX21F8Q?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” The Economist noted. “[The PLA is in a major crisis](https://semafor.com/s/Fs8ekW1WWS?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” one expert warned, “with a level of leadership instability unseen since the heyday of the Cultural Revolution.”

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via ReutersSaudi Arabia will downscale its massive NEOM infrastructure project, as plummeting oil prices force Riyadh to slash spending. Critics have long questioned the viability of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s flagship project — at the heart of which is [a 110-mile (170-kilometer) linear city](https://semafor.com/s/ipPOiYk6wV?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to house almost 9 million people — with critics saying the kingdom has [more important development priorities](https://semafor.com/s/725KilYp77?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Semafor reported today that NEOM’s leadership has [brought in a new tier of management](https://semafor.com/s/eFj8Oi7RNJ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to improve oversight of the mammoth project. Lower oil prices have limited Riyadh’s options elsewhere: On Saturday, officials said the Gulf nation will [no longer host the 2029 Asian Winter Games](https://semafor.com/s/oOswJ0W1Rb?email=wschenk@gmail.com), signalling “a new willingness to face reality,” Semafor’s Saudi Arabia bureau chief wrote.

↓↓55India, EU boost ties with new deals

 
India looks set to sign deals strengthening relations with the EU, the latest indication of the rapid realignment of global ties in the year since US President Donald Trump took office. Top EU officials will be the guests of honor at India’s Republic Day celebrations, and are expected to [sign a trade agreement](https://semafor.com/s/0SUqS7JeOC?email=wschenk@gmail.com) as well as [a security and maritime pact](https://semafor.com/s/g4yRB0hSij?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Both Brussels and Delhi have faced Trump’s wrath over the past 12 months, and the deals, which were agreed unusually quickly, point to the priority they have placed on shifting away from a reliance on Washington. “In an increasingly volatile world,” the European Commission chief told the Times of India, “[this cooperation is not only valuable, it is vital](https://semafor.com/s/wgoQjRGvqS?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

↓↓66VW considers US retreat

 
Volkswagen may pull its plans for a major Audi factory in the US, citing President Donald Trump’s automotive tariffs. The car giant’s CEO told Handelsblatt that US levies cost VW $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2025, and that [reductions were necessary](https://semafor.com/s/Rw7a8vtcow?email=wschenk@gmail.com). German investments in the US as a whole [fell 45% year-on-year in 2025 as Trump’s duties took hold](https://semafor.com/s/keFXAmhTTb?email=wschenk@gmail.com), Reuters reported, while German exports to the US also fell, although the dollar’s depreciation was likely a factor. After Trump warned at the World Economic Forum last week of possible further duties on Europe, growing global uncertainty over the stability of trade relationships [pushed gold above $5,000 per ounce for the first time](https://semafor.com/s/ii5NnD1WlZ?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓77Mexico may cut oil to Cuba

 
Mexico is reportedly considering halting oil shipments to Cuba in a bid to avoid retaliation from Washington, which is looking to overthrow the regime in Havana. Cuba had long relied on Venezuelan oil to run its economy, but crude shipments have plummeted since the US ouster of Nicolás Maduro and its blockade on oil tankers leaving Venezuela; Mexico is now the [top oil exporter to Cuba](https://semafor.com/s/qoUENLOosL?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Mexico is seeking to placate US President Donald Trump — who has repeatedly threatened steep tariffs as well as military strikes against cartels in the country — ahead of [an upcoming review](https://semafor.com/s/AXyg58tLlQ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) of a North American free trade agreement that is a lifeline for Mexico’s economy.

↓↓88S&P boosts DRC outlook

 
Global credit ratings agency S&P raised the Democratic Republic of Congo’s outlook to positive from stable, citing its fiscal performance and rising exports. The revision represents [a reprieve for the war-wracked nation](https://semafor.com/s/gQ1zmUNFif?email=wschenk@gmail.com), which has been the subject of renewed interest from Chinese and US mining firms seeking control of the country’s vast resources. The DRC holds some of the world’s biggest metal deposits, including of cobalt, a key component in the lithium-ion batteries that power EVs. S&P’s decision comes shortly after the International Monetary Fund approved a new[ $440 million financing facility](https://semafor.com/s/bYPd4UuHPf?email=wschenk@gmail.com) for the country, though IMF officials warned of commodity price fluctuations, as well as of the risk of a renewed conflict with Rwanda-backed rebels.

↓↓99Heathrow relaxes rules over fluids

 
Maja Smiejkowska/Reuters 
Maja Smiejkowska/ReutersLondon Heathrow, the world’s sixth-busiest airport, will allow passengers to carry fluids in containers larger than 100 ml (3.4 fl oz). The rules have been in place since 2006, following a foiled plot involving [bombs disguised as soft drinks](https://semafor.com/s/DSiWU14cYR?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Several other UK and international airports have done likewise, notably London Gatwick and Dubai International. Airline security measures tend to ratchet up, so possible declines are noteworthy, though the end of what The Guardian called “[the tyranny of tiny toiletries](https://semafor.com/s/wfdQdGx8Fv?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” is driven not by reduced concern but by the rollout of new scanning technologies which can reliably tell explosive liquids from harmless ones. US concern over air terrorism has [declined since its post-9/11 peak](https://semafor.com/s/zt7q1UmT3t?email=wschenk@gmail.com), although [UK citizens remain worried](https://semafor.com/s/MKWthADaVI?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓1010Japan parts with Chinese pandas

 
Japan’s only pandas will return to China tomorrow, with relations between Tokyo and Beijing frosty. Crowds gathered at Tokyo’s Ueno Zoo for emotional goodbyes to Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei during their last public appearance Sunday; their departure [leaves the country without pandas for the first time since 1972](https://semafor.com/s/P13wqvUpQT?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s recent comments that Japan could support Taiwan if China attacked the island sparked tensions, and prospects of replacement pandas are uncertain. Beijing has used loans of the bamboo-eating, sex-shy bears to gesture goodwill to other nations since World War II, and the growing hostility between the East Asian powers suggests that goodwill is in short supply.

Oh, CanadaThe big moment at this year’s World Economic Forum was Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech. It was “by far the most weighty reaction we have seen so far from any head of government to the crisis unleashed in the international relations of the West” by US President Donald Trump, the economic historian Adam Tooze argues. Previous speakers had avoided the issue, offered mild rebuke, or shrugged exasperatedly, but Carney “[struck a note of appropriate seriousness and high moral temper](https://semafor.com/s/dgZSlcvoEi?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” in saying that middle-sized powers could no longer rely on the superpowers, and must draw together to build a new rules-based order.But while it came as a surprise to hear Canada reject the hegemony of its southern neighbor — albeit without ever naming it or its president — Carney has expressed the sentiments before, Tooze notes. In 2019, while serving as governor of the Bank of England, Carney highlighted the risk of the world’s economy relying so heavily on the US. “Under the shadow of Trump 1.0,” Tooze says, “Carney had concluded that a wind of change was blowing. It was time to prepare for a world beyond American hegemony.” Then as now, he argued that the answer was not to swap one hegemon for another, but to create a balanced, truly multipolar, world.Balls in your courtThe prevailing wisdom seems to be that Davos had become a bit stale in recent years. “Having been the ‘it’ place to be for global executives and power players,” the economist Timothy Ash writes, “it had become a bit naff, smeared with an aura of being an elitist party for intellectually bankrupt globalistas.” But this year, he says, it has been interesting: US President Donald Trump “breathed new life” into it, by starting a fight with Europe over Greenland, and one in which — although he claimed victory — he took something of a beating. Trump had assumed Brussels would roll over, but it pushed back, and Trump blinked.That does not make it a win for Europe, though. Trump’s subsequent comments denigrating NATO allies — not even acknowledging that the US is the only country ever to invoke Article 5, and that Europeans died fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan — have undermined the alliance. Europe may have “[found its balls](https://semafor.com/s/ZitYMGBTRj?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” and probably has enough military power to hold off Russia without US help, although it is still being polite to Washington while it fast-tracks its own defense capability. The real winner is Beijing, because Trump has forced Europe to look elsewhere for strategic relationships.Stop the world, I want to get offThe other big story of Davos was AI. Two of the giants of the industry, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and his Google DeepMind counterpart Demis Hassabis, spoke on stage together Tuesday, and both agreed: AI is progressing too fast. “It would be good to have a slightly slower pace than we’re currently predicting,” Hassabis said; Amodei agreed that tapping the brakes would be “better for the world.” You would think that they would be the best-placed people to actually do the slowing down, but they insisted otherwise. Without international, government-backed enforcement, “it’s very hard to have an enforceable agreement where they slow down and we slow down,” Amodei said.“[The message was one of helplessness](https://semafor.com/s/3eWcJBiVjs?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” Shakeel Hashim and Celia Ford write in Transformer. “The executives freely admit to being trapped in a prisoner’s dilemma: Each would prefer to slow down, but none will do so unilaterally. They are crying out for someone — anyone — to step in and help them.” Unfortunately, the collapse of the international world order is making that more difficult. As mentioned above, the rules-based order no longer functions. “If the AI CEOs are to be believed, they are on the cusp of building immensely powerful — and destabilizing — technology,” Hashim and Ford say. “Only governments working together can rein them in. Yet the prospect of international coordination feels increasingly like a pipe dream.”— Tom Chivers
