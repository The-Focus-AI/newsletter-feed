Amir Cohen/ReutersIsrael said it recovered the body of the final hostage held in Gaza, a milestone in efforts to advance a US-brokered ceasefire in the enclave. Police officer Ran Gvili was killed [fighting Hamas attackers](https://semafor.com/s/2BHo6PRG01?email=wschenk@gmail.com) on Oct. 7, 2023 — Israel had resisted moving ahead with the truce until his remains were retrieved. For the first time since 2014, there are no Israeli hostages, dead or alive, in Gaza — “a reminder of [the deep roots of this conflict](https://semafor.com/s/JhWi16SkyC?email=wschenk@gmail.com) and how difficult it could still be to shape a lasting peace,” the BBC wrote. Israel also said Monday it will [reopen a key border crossing](https://semafor.com/s/mHy5wYeRCi?email=wschenk@gmail.com) between Gaza and Egypt, but the next steps of the peace plan center on more challenging tasks, including Hamas’ disarmament.

Tim Evans/Reuters 
Tim Evans/ReutersUS President Donald Trump on Monday sent his border czar to oversee immigration enforcement in Minneapolis and [softened his tone](https://semafor.com/s/0oFK1PAmfG?email=wschenk@gmail.com) on the ongoing crackdown, after federal agents killed a second US citizen there. In a sign of Trump’s efforts to quell [bipartisan backlash](https://semafor.com/s/1piRYtjuI5?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to Saturday’s shooting of Alex Pretti, the president spoke with Minnesota’s Democratic governor and said they are “[on a similar wavelength](https://semafor.com/s/jHPAXMCdeI?email=wschenk@gmail.com).” State officials, meanwhile, urged a US judge to [block the deployment](https://semafor.com/s/2jfl8AwC0y?email=wschenk@gmail.com) of thousands of federal agents. The reckoning has spurred some Republicans to [worry the Trump administration is losing control](https://semafor.com/s/WB4nKbNpbE?email=wschenk@gmail.com) of the narrative around immigration, squandering one of its strongest issues. Some Border Patrol agents are reportedly [set to leave Minnesota this week](https://semafor.com/s/SdIv4O6Cn9?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓33Europe pushes for energy, tech control

 
Stephane Mahe/Reuters 
Stephane Mahe/ReutersHeightened transatlantic tensions are spurring Europe’s push for energy and tech independence. Ten European countries on Monday agreed to collaborate on a [massive offshore wind farm project](https://semafor.com/s/K50n4cBzYK?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in the North Sea, linking to all participants via submarine cables. “Energy is now central to this volatile age,” the UK and EU’s energy czars wrote in Politico, emphasizing the need for “[homegrown clean power](https://semafor.com/s/oq6fyV6bpo?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” to achieve security. The EU is also accelerating efforts to [promote tech sovereignty](https://semafor.com/s/OXT56vNE5M?email=wschenk@gmail.com), The Wall Street Journal reported, after the US’ Greenland quest sparked concerns of a once unthinkable scenario in which Washington could cut off the region’s access to American tech. Still, a decoupling is unlikely; Europe is [hugely reliant](https://semafor.com/s/hFCZaF5Zhr?email=wschenk@gmail.com) on US cloud computing services.

↓↓44EU ramps up tech enforcement

 
Yves Herman/Reuters 
Yves Herman/ReutersThe EU signaled it is stepping up oversight of large US tech platforms, risking further ire from Washington. The European Commission on Monday [opened an investigation](https://semafor.com/s/Tzd3XkF92r?email=wschenk@gmail.com) into Elon Musk’s social media network, X, over a proliferation of nonconsensual sexualized deepfakes created by its AI tool. The EU also plans to [heighten scrutiny of WhatsApp](https://semafor.com/s/q2pPjLjUaf?email=wschenk@gmail.com) after subjecting Meta’s messaging platform to the bloc’s toughest standards over its high numbers of users. Brussels began [rethinking its Big Tech crackdown](https://semafor.com/s/UUaXCUbpXO?email=wschenk@gmail.com) last year, but has since faced calls to [hold firm and increase enforcement](https://semafor.com/s/oNIxlJgw5X?email=wschenk@gmail.com), despite threats of US retaliation over the continent’s regulatory impulses. Efforts to create an independent bloc-wide tech regulator — “[Washington’s worst nightmare](https://semafor.com/s/6ArgisysUs?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” — are now picking up steam, Politico EU reported.

↓↓55US lobbying over data centers intensifies

 
Nvidia is investing $2 billion in cloud computing provider CoreWeave [to boost the buildout of data centers](https://semafor.com/s/ME27suvW9X?email=wschenk@gmail.com), which are set to become a central political focus in the US this year. Some of the country’s largest data center operators [plan to boost spending](https://semafor.com/s/DO4kk9IXCh?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in an attempt to lobby lawmakers and affected communities to back the projects, which have faced heavy resistance over accusations that they drive up energy prices and use too much water. At least [25 projects were canceled](https://semafor.com/s/aqbQy3PhaL?email=wschenk@gmail.com) last year following local opposition, Heatmap News reported. Another two dozen were blocked or delayed just this month, according to research firm MacroEdge. A [populist backlash to data centers](https://semafor.com/s/gnj7sR7Esn?email=wschenk@gmail.com) could play out in this year’s midterm elections across partisan lines, analysts say.

↓↓66World order driven by ‘personalist’ leaders

 
Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters 
Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersUS President Donald Trump’s foreign policy moves are rooted in his “personalist” leadership — a trait shared by the leaders of China and Russia, two political scientists wrote in Foreign Affairs. Personalist leaders, they argued, are “driven [purely by their own private fixations](https://semafor.com/s/UOSenYAVlh?email=wschenk@gmail.com) and incentives rather than coherent national interests.” The US’ ouster of Nicolás Maduro, for instance, was partly motivated by the Venezuelan leader’s mockery of Trump. Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who recently purged [his top general](https://semafor.com/s/ZGDhpWAXhJ?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and Vladimir Putin, whose obsession with [revisionist Russian history](https://semafor.com/s/OfiAPw3i63?email=wschenk@gmail.com) underpinned his Ukraine invasion, have similarly hoarded authority. While a disregard for norms might sometimes offer surprise diplomatic wins, “a world led by personalist great powers will not aid global stability,” the experts wrote.

↓↓77Chinese AI apps turn to cash handouts

A Baidu booth at a tech expo. Go Nakamura/ReutersChinese AI apps are turning to cash handouts to attract new users, the latest sign of the country’s hyper-competitive tech landscape. Tech giants Baidu and Tencent are both offering [virtual “red envelopes”](https://semafor.com/s/p6iLg1LAtF?email=wschenk@gmail.com) as signup incentives — a nod to the cash gifts given to loved ones during Lunar New Year. AI apps have [emerged as the next frontier](https://semafor.com/s/QphKtrsbIE?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in the country’s tech arms race, as firms rush to inject their chatbots with shopping and payment tools. It reflects China’s focus on widespread AI adoption: Companies are [prioritizing proliferation over](https://semafor.com/s/uJEDqHc3Il?email=wschenk@gmail.com) profitability. AI business models in China “still haven’t been figured out,” a Trivium China analyst argued on a recent podcast. Consumer-facing apps “do have subscriptions, but [nobody’s paying for them](https://semafor.com/s/MdD1Ju2y12?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

↓↓88High prices drive hunt for copper

 
The rising price of copper is making miners turn to previously uneconomic means of extraction. Using bacteria to turn low-grade ore into copper has been possible for decades, but when the metal was plentiful and in low demand, it made little economic sense. Now, with futures prices above $13,000 a tonne, Rio Tinto and other mining groups are turning to that and other methods to extract copper from low-purity sources. Efforts to salvage copper from waste material ejected from mines could also allow old sites to become “an important additional source of copper [as demand soars and supply dwindles](https://semafor.com/s/Nx6hVjageu?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” one mining executive told the Financial Times. Copper is vital in energy infrastructure, and new sources of supply are not keeping up.

↓↓99Shingles shot could cut dementia risk

 
Kevin Lamarque/Reuters 
Kevin Lamarque/ReutersNew research reinforced the evidence that the shingles vaccine protects against dementia. Previous research had suggested that it could reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s by around 20%; two new studies found similar results. The finding has now been seen in four countries in studies spanning 20 years and millions of people. The research used “[natural experiments](https://semafor.com/s/gXk9QRzPHz?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” — the vaccine was rolled out at different times in regions within the countries studied, allowing comparisons between those who had it earlier and later. The new findings support the idea that the vaccine is protective, the physician Eric Topol wrote, a significant development: If a drug was found that reduced Alzheimer’s risk by 20%, “[it would be considered a major breakthrough](https://semafor.com/s/MWriwcSVWt?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”

Loic Venance/AFP via Getty ImagesA yachting team won the Jules Verne Trophy — so called as it was first awarded to a sailing vessel that circumnavigated the world in less than 80 days — in 40 days and 10 hours. The Sodebo Ultim 3, captained by Thomas Coville, sailed 28,315 miles nonstop from the English Channel, beneath the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn and back, at an average 27 knots (31 mph). It beat the previous record by 13 hours, and the original record, set by Bruno Peyron in the ship Explorer in 1993, by almost 39 days. The Sodebo was [on course to break the symbolic 40-day barrier,](https://semafor.com/s/6zcPDBjf2H?email=wschenk@gmail.com) Yachting World noted, but lost time avoiding an Atlantic storm near the Bay of Biscay.

Then-Prime Minister Theresa May and President Donald Trump with a statue of Winston Churchill in 2017. Kevin Lamarque/ReutersBesides negotiating trade deals and peace plans, diplomats have another tricky task: choosing artwork. It’s a decision that can cause micro cultural wars within the halls of power, arts writer Christian House wrote for the Financial Times. Case in point: the controversial Winston Churchill bust that is frequently removed and reinstated by different White House occupants. “[Not all embassies are equal](https://semafor.com/s/8NBCJNi3zg?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” when it comes to art, the former British ambassador to France said, suggesting — perhaps unsurprisingly — that Paris is “the apex of British embassies” despite some “risqué” choices. Japan’s embassy in London prefers “apolitical” art themes, a sentiment echoed by Denmark’s UK ambassador, who argued that diplomats discussing defense don’t need distractions: Art should be seen, not heard, she said.
