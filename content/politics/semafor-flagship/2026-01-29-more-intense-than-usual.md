↓↓11Turkey mediates amid US-Iran tensions

 
Majid Asgaripour/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via Reuters 
Majid Asgaripour/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via ReutersIran’s top diplomat is visiting Turkey on Thursday for talks aimed at averting a US strike, as President Donald Trump ramps up threats of military action against Tehran. Ankara is trying to convince Iran to [offer nuclear concessions](https://semafor.com/s/TkNZuzwFAb?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to avoid a conflict, and has proposed a video call between Trump and his Iranian counterpart, The Guardian reported. Trump warned earlier this week that time is [running out for nuclear negotiations](https://semafor.com/s/OFRyC7bVl2?email=wschenk@gmail.com) following Iran’s crackdown on anti-government protests. Security forces have since rounded up thousands to [deter future demonstrations](https://semafor.com/s/kwribrAOza?email=wschenk@gmail.com), Reuters reported. But any US attempt to topple the regime “would confront the reality that Iran’s power extends beyond its top leadership, rooted in a [deeply entrenched institutional network](https://semafor.com/s/HUYiEdS2Y8?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that could maintain control,” Al-Monitor wrote.

↓↓22AstraZeneca deepens China investment

 
AstraZeneca will invest $15 billion in China through 2030, the British pharmaceutical giant announced Thursday during the UK prime minister’s visit to Beijing. Astra is the biggest foreign drugmaker in China, and has been ramping up its investments there despite [scrutiny from authorities](https://semafor.com/s/P9GcuCGjfz?email=wschenk@gmail.com): Beijing detained Astra’s top local executive in 2024. The move reflects the recent boom in China’s biotech ecosystem, [marked by thousands of new startups](https://semafor.com/s/TasBFxpf5d?email=wschenk@gmail.com), innovative research and development, and a speedy clinical trial process, a pharma-focused outlet wrote. More than a third of biopharma licensing deals last year involved a Chinese firm. The leaders of the UK and China, pledging closer ties, also reached other agreements, including [30-day visa-free travel](https://semafor.com/s/FjYoPhj6hh?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to the mainland for Britons.

↓↓33Tech stocks fall on AI spending jitters

 
US tech stocks slumped on Thursday after earnings reports from industry giants raised questions about how long it will take for aggressive AI spending to pay off. Microsoft shares fell 10%, the company’s [biggest single-day plunge since March 2020](https://semafor.com/s/pBmcJy7eRY?email=wschenk@gmail.com), after it reported record AI spending, but slowing cloud growth. Fear is creeping back into investors’ minds that “the AI theme may [not be as immediately lucrative](https://semafor.com/s/w1mn8XfRej?email=wschenk@gmail.com) as hoped,” one analyst said, though he cautioned that it’s far too early to declare the AI trade has peaked. At the same time, there are rising concerns on Wall Street that “AI investments will [eat the software companies’ lunches](https://semafor.com/s/lp21agq3mZ?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” another strategist said. Software stocks [entered bear-market territory](https://semafor.com/s/pZ0dRkIwtc?email=wschenk@gmail.com) Thursday.

↓↓44Tesla leans into robots

 
Tesla wants to make fewer cars and more robots. CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday that the EV giant, which has seen falling vehicle sales, will stop making its Model S and X, and instead use a California [factory to build humanoids](https://semafor.com/s/YLVTXeT1G5?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The shift reflects Musk’s “[futuristic vision](https://semafor.com/s/dcXXupNlmI?email=wschenk@gmail.com)” of tech, CNN wrote: His rocket-maker SpaceX and AI startup xAI are in talks to merge ahead of a massive IPO later this year, Reuters reported, with a goal of launching data centers into orbit. Tesla’s pivot to robots, accompanied by a [$20 billion capital spending pledge](https://semafor.com/s/ynwwB2ZbW5?email=wschenk@gmail.com) this year, is risky. China is considered the leader in humanoids, but its leading firm [only shipped about 5,500 bots](https://semafor.com/s/0WCStuUSGg?email=wschenk@gmail.com) last year. Tesla [shipped 150](https://semafor.com/s/oLL8FNafcM?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

↓↓55French government to stop Zoom calls

 
Charles Platiau/Reuters 
Charles Platiau/ReutersThe French government will stop using US-made videoconferencing software in favor of homegrown technology, part of a wider European move toward self-reliance. From 2027, the domestic Visio platform will [replace Zoom and Microsoft Teams, among others](https://semafor.com/s/puN4PASfp7?email=wschenk@gmail.com). The EU is increasingly keen on digital sovereignty: It is backing [a network of European data service providers](https://semafor.com/s/44jHEUCPtr?email=wschenk@gmail.com) to reduce dependence on US cloud computing, a card payment system to rival Visa and Mastercard, and semiconductor manufacturers to avoid relying on Intel and TSMC. The bloc has accelerated efforts amid tensions with Washington, but the push is not new: The “Galileo” satellite navigation system was [set in place in 2016](https://semafor.com/s/gmItngU6l8?email=wschenk@gmail.com) as a response to concerns that Europe was dependent on the US military’s GPS tech.

↓↓66Russian energy, defense sectors slow

Alexander Manzyuk/Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesA slowdown in Russia’s defense and energy sectors is weighing on the country’s war economy. Oil and gas revenues have fallen because of low prices, a global glut of crude, and sanctions, while military-related industries, including weapon and ammunition production, are [seeing languishing growth](https://semafor.com/s/8olDpU5Fe4?email=wschenk@gmail.com), government projections show. “This year’s problems seem [more intense than usual](https://semafor.com/s/OCEsc7shaI?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” The Bell wrote. Moscow is looking to hike taxes to shore up its budget, the only way it can find the resources to continue its war against Ukraine, Meduza argued. “Even so, the Kremlin shows no sign of moving toward peace — a choice that [bodes poorly for the Russian economy](https://semafor.com/s/xQyPu3J4Ge?email=wschenk@gmail.com) in 2026.”

↓↓77US eyes drawdown of ICE agents in Minn.

 
Tim Evans/Reuters 
Tim Evans/ReutersUS President Donald Trump’s border czar said Thursday that immigration operations in Minneapolis would become “safer,” with plans for an eventual “drawdown” of federal agents on the streets. [Tom Homan’s comments](https://semafor.com/s/57vT8FBrmh?email=wschenk@gmail.com) followed Trump’s remarks suggesting a “de-escalation” after weeks of tumult over agents killing two US citizens in the city. The furor has become a [political headache for Republicans](https://semafor.com/s/t9TbXTMK3y?email=wschenk@gmail.com): Democratic senators on Thursday blocked a spending bill that would keep the government open past Friday and put billions toward homeland security funding. The unrest has also spotlighted private-sector actors that have benefited from Trump’s deportation push. Companies including Palantir and Deloitte have collectively [made more than $22 billion](https://semafor.com/s/5DKixe7BAw?email=wschenk@gmail.com) from contracts with government agencies leading the immigration crackdown, the Financial Times reported.

↓↓88US life expectancy rises

 
US life expectancy at birth reached an all-time high in 2024. Americans tend to die younger than inhabitants of other rich nations — in 2022, the average US citizen died at 78, compared to 82 in similarly wealthy Luxembourg or Ireland, and [equivalent to much poorer Estonia](https://semafor.com/s/tkBtHCFntt?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Life expectancy was particularly hard hit during the pandemic, with US lifespans dropping about 1.8 years. But things have improved. [Opioid overdoses fell 35% between 2023 and 2024](https://semafor.com/s/DZ99kcSMR3?email=wschenk@gmail.com), which epidemiologists told The Wall Street Journal was likely down to increased distribution of anti-overdose drugs and other policy changes. That, and the decline of COVID-19, meant the country saw life expectancy jump 0.6 years to 79 between 2023 and 2024.

↓↓99Waging a moral war against death

 
Vitalism Foundation 
Vitalism FoundationA burgeoning movement is aiming to upend the “longevity” field by waging a war against death. Wide interest in anti-aging efforts has taken off in recent years, thanks in part to controversial proponents like millionaire [Bryan Johnson](https://semafor.com/s/T4tsoxB6Ab?email=wschenk@gmail.com). But “longevity” has a branding problem, a group called the Vitalists believes. Their core philosophy is that “[death is bad and life is good](https://semafor.com/s/bBgB9N6ASj?email=wschenk@gmail.com),” MIT Technology Review wrote. Humanity has a moral duty to defeat death, they argue, which would require a political and culture-wide upheaval. Some researchers and policymakers are taking them seriously, even as many of the anti-aging treatments they are exploring — ranging from drugs to cryonics — don’t yet exist.

↓↓1010Baby boom for Northern right whales

 
Stan Grossfeld/The Boston Globe via Getty Images 
Stan Grossfeld/The Boston Globe via Getty ImagesNorth Atlantic right whales are undergoing a mini baby boom, with 21 births so far this calving season. The species was hunted almost to extinction — it was the “right whale” to hunt, as it was slow, coastal, blubber-filled, and buoyant — and there are still only 384 known individuals. [But numbers are slowly going up](https://semafor.com/s/7eM3jPFCg5?email=wschenk@gmail.com). Whale conservation more broadly has been a success — South Atlantic humpback numbers have risen from around 450 in the 1950s to [more than 25,000 now](https://semafor.com/s/MD0rrnc0el?email=wschenk@gmail.com), close to pre-whaling levels, while gray whales have been taken off the endangered list. Southern right whales are recovering faster than northern ones, too. Whales still face dangers from vessel strikes and fishing gear, as well as declining food stocks.

No Full Stops in India, by Mark Tully. The Kolkata-born, Cambridge-educated journalist and longtime Delhi bureau chief for the BBC died this week at 90. Interviewing Indians in a “delightful polyglot” of Hindi and Punjabi, and reaching 50 million on his evening broadcasts, Tully sought a balance that was reflective of his identities [as an Englishman and as an Indian](https://semafor.com/s/GXcIHJuQR5?email=wschenk@gmail.com), The Wire wrote. For many, he was a credible voice amid chaos, and often drew the ire of the political elite. Tully Saheb, as he was affectionately known in Punjab, was dogged by an aura of celebrity across India, The Economist wrote. “It was he, in his plummy English tones, who told them… [what was going on in their country](https://semafor.com/s/fwf5UNHB3o?email=wschenk@gmail.com).”
