“Donald Trump now genuinely lives in a different reality,” Anne Applebaum writes in her article for The Atlantic on the president’s public letter to Norway’s prime minister—a grammatically and historically incorrect document in which he complained about not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, demanded control of Greenland (a Danish territory), and claimed to have “done more for NATO than any person since its founding.”

One year into Trump’s second presidency, American allies have tried to find a theory that explains his behavior. “Isolationism, neo-imperialism, and patrimonialism are all words that have been thrown around,” Applebaum writes, “But in the end, the president himself defeats all attempts to describe a ‘Trump Doctrine.’” She calls for Republicans in Congress to step in to prevent the president from causing further harm to American interests and alliances.

But what if Congress doesn’t? In his article for The Atlantic, Tom Nichols explains how the burden will fall on the U.S. military to choose whether or not to attack Denmark, a nation that has been America’s ally for all the wars of the 20th century, and even joined our fight against the Taliban after 9/11. “These will be orders that force U.S. military minds to step into a horrifying mirror universe,” Nichols writes, “where the United States is the aggressor against NATO, a coalition that includes countries that have been our friends for centuries.”

Attacking an ally would be a perversion of everything the armed forces have been trained to do.
