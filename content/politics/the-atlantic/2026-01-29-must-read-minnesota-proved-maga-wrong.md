“The federal surge into Minneapolis reflects a series of mistaken MAGA assumptions,” Adam Serwer writes in his latest reporting for The Atlantic. First: diverse communities aren’t possible. Second: the left will abandon its professed values—of inclusion, unity, and open arms—at the first sensation of sustained pressure. Third: liberals are weak, while real men—Trump’s men—are conversely strong. In the Minnesotan resistance, however, “all of the ideological cornerstones of MAGA have been proved false at once.”

Serwer’s reporting took him across the Twin Cities, from the suburbs where local volunteers patrolled for federal agents or delivered food for families too afraid to leave their homes, to downtown Minneapolis, where protesters faced tear gas and pepper spray in below-zero temperatures. Everywhere he went, he found Minnesotans protecting the people around them with nonviolent, neighborly resistance.

With the departure of Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official who had led the ICE operation in Minneapolis, Serwer writes, “The people of Minnesota have forced the Trump administration into a strategic retreat—one inflicted not as rioters or insurgents, but as neighbors.”

By Adam Serwer
