On the morning of January 24, Ingrid Rasmussen, the pastor at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Minneapolis, rushed to the scene after getting word that a man had been shot by ICE agents. “By the time she got there, Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse, was dead,” Robert F. Worth writes in his reporting for The Atlantic. “The federal agents who had wrestled him to the ground and then shot and killed him were throwing tear gas and flash-bangs at a crowd of furious protesters chanting ‘Shame!’”

Worth was in Minneapolis last week studying how the community had responded to ICE’s presence. At protests, at civilian training sessions, at a bus stop where parent observers made sure everyone’s kids made it into school, he found local networks across the city—without central organization or leadership, but with buy-in across generations, races, and creeds. “At times, Minneapolis reminded me of what I saw during the Arab Spring in 2011,” he writes, “a series of street clashes between protesters and police that quickly swelled into a much larger struggle against autocracy.”

Atlantic writers are covering the situation in Minneapolis and analyzing what Pretti’s killing, Renee Good’s killing, and the Trump administration’s response means for America.
