Do you know someone who’s changing the climate story for the better? Nominations are open for the Gulbenkian Prize for Humanity 2026  - a €1 million award that shines a spotlight on individuals, groups and organisations that are turning bold climate vision into measurable change. They’re looking for more nominations (they didn’t get a lot through this year) and we figured there would be plenty of readers who might be interested. Past winners include Greta Thunberg, the Antarctic Southern Ocean Coalition, and the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. Entries close Friday 30th January 2026.
This week’s top stories
For the first time in history, more people in Mexico are categorized as middle class than as living in poverty. Income poverty has declined from 35.5% of the population in 2018 to 21.7% in 2024, according to World Bank data. Over the same period, the middle class expanded from 27.2% to 39.6%. The shift reflects what President Sheinbaum calls “a moral economy, welfare programs, rights, not assistance programs but rights.” Mexico News Daily 
And, for the first time since October 2023, aid partners in Gaza now hold enough food to meet 100% of minimum caloric needs. That compares with late 2025, when families received just 50–75% of required calories. The United Nations is supporting the production of around 170,000 two-kilogram bread bundles daily, but access, security and the risk of Israel suspending NGO operations mean the gains remain fragile. UN News 
According to Albert Cheung, the Head of Global Transition Analysis at BloombergNEF , the global energy transition is still accelerating, even as the politics worsen. Global wind and solar installations passed 800 GW last year, triple the pace of 2021, falling battery costs have enabled grid-scale storage just as renewable penetration deepens, and electric vehicles now account for over 25% of global car sales. The drivers of the transition have shifted from moral appeals to energy security and competitiveness. Hard-to-abate sectors still lag, policy uncertainty remains real and 1.5°C is not going to happen. But economics, rising demand and technological capacity are now carrying the transition forward — unevenly, but irreversibly. 
Global electric vehicle sales reached 20.7 million in 2025, up 20% year on year, driven by strong growth in Europe and emerging markets, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence . Europe overtook China as the fastest-growing major market, while sales outside China, Europe, and North America jumped 48%. 
Gregor Macdonald  notes that the global consumption of gasoline is starting to flatline…
… and electrified models outsold combustion Porsches in Europe for the first time in 2025 . 
After 20 years of negotiation, the High Seas Treaty entered into force last week, creating the first legal framework to protect biodiversity across the 64% of the ocean beyond national jurisdiction. Attention now turns to what comes next: setting up a secretariat, agreeing on funding and benefit-sharing rules, launching a scientific body to propose marine protected areas, and negotiating with fisheries bodies and deep-sea mining regulators. Many question marks remain, but, for the first time ever, high seas conservation sits on a legally enforceable framework. Dialogue Earth 
🐾  Some nice animal stories for your feed
New Zealand’s critically endangered kākāpō have begun breeding  for the first time since 2022, triggered by a ‘mega-mast’ fruiting of native rimu trees that provides the energy needed to raise chicks. 
New York  has passed the Horseshoe Crab Protection Act, setting a timetable to end commercial harvesting of this ancient species by 2029.
Belgium  has banned imports of hunting trophies from endangered species, while Germany  has banned fur farming (Poland , Europe’s largest producer, banned it last month).
An explosion of water voles! (Petition to make that the new collective noun). Endangered water vole populations across the east of England have surged  following sustained eradication of invasive American mink, their main predator.
Some recoveries are quieter. European wildcats , once thought lost from central Europe, are being rediscovered through camera traps, with scientists estimating around 140,000 persist across more than two dozen countries.
Przewalski’s horse, extinct in the wild by the 1960s, now roams again  in Mongolia and Kazakhstan following decades of captive breeding led by the Prague Zoo.
Global tiger numbers have risen from 3,200 in 2010 to 5,574 by 2023, with Thailand  now supporting up to 223 tigers after two decades of protection.
In India’s Assam state, no rhinos were poached in 2025 , only the second such year since records began. 
And in China, the Yangtze sturgeon, absent from the wild since 2000, is back, following two decades of captive breeding and releases led by Zhou Liang. 
Psychiatry is finally finding an objective way to spot mental illness. Depressed people speak differently: compared to their pre-depressed selves, they pause more and speak less, and their voices lack variation in pitch. This is devilishly difficult for a psychiatrist to detect, but for an AI on your phone, it’s easy… and for mental health professionals, it might be the holy grail. Psychiatry has, since its inception, tried to mimic the diagnostic precision of more physical forms of medicine, but it hasn’t. And how could it? Psychiatrists have little to work with besides patients’ descriptions of their own internality, which can be fuzzy, never mind fraught. 
Now we’re within reach of something better. A rush of startups in the United States are using AI and wearables to try and identify biomarkers associated with various mental illnesses. The hope is to eventually allow for diagnostic data to supplement patient self-reports, improve psychiatric precision, or enable those who can’t go to a psychiatrist get a diagnosis. New Scientist 
No-till farming helps Canada post record grain exports. Canadian farmers are harvesting record spring wheat and canola crops, driven largely by widespread no-till and zero-till farming that locks in soil moisture and cuts erosion. Longer term, yields are up 77% for wheat and nearly double for canola since the mid-1990s. As the world’s largest canola exporter and a top five wheat producer, Canada’s gains are easing global food supply pressures even as climate volatility intensifies. Reuters 
“We were sitting with our calculator saying ‘we can afford that!’” A manufacturer in Bangladesh will launch a generic version of the cystic fibrosis drug Trikafta in spring 2026, cutting annual costs from about $370,000 to as little as $12,750 for adults and $6,375 for children. The breakthrough follows years of campaigning by parents, challenging monopoly pricing that left three-quarters of the world’s 190,000 CF patients without access. The Guardian 
Since 2015 India, the world’s most populous country, has cut malaria incidence by 80%, tuberculosis by 21%, and maternal mortality from 130 to 88 per 100,000 live births. Infant and under-five deaths have also fallen sharply, with the government emphasising that sustained primary-care and treatment scale-up remain a priority going forward. Times of India 
Poland moves to recognise same-sex couples. Poland’s government has approved a bill introducing “cohabitation contracts” for couples living together regardless of gender - its first nationwide legal recognition of queer relationships. The bill, which covers health, housing and tax rights, stops short of marriage, but activists say it’s the only one with a real shot of passing in the current parliament. Reuters 
Really good news: American lawmakers have agreed to a $50 billion compromise foreign assistance budget for 2026, restoring funding for Gavi and the International Development Association while preserving over $9.4 billion for global health, $5.4 billion for humanitarian aid and $691.5 million for global education. As one education advocate put it, the funding is “relatively good, considering everything.” Devex 
And finally, Dylan Matthews  revisits the core argument of a book project he was working on that collapsed because editors struggled to believe it: that since the 1970s, the US social safety net has expanded and absolute poverty has fallen a lot. 
The overall point that the safety net has grown, and that living standards at the bottom have improved, struck me as so obvious and clear in the data that I hadn’t braced myself for the depth of disbelief. I suspect a large part of the issue is that the people I was pitching are mostly liberals and leftists, and an unstated premise of a lot of left-of-center advocacy is that you must paint the world in a maximally negative way so as to inspire people to push for change.
Progress
UNICEF : “Around the world, quiet but powerful progress is being made to protect children’s rights to good health. New vaccines are reaching more communities, life-saving treatments are becoming more affordable, and countries are finding smarter, more sustainable ways to deliver care. The collective work of many – from research to advocacy, from supply to community delivery – is helping to prevent disease, save lives, and give every child a healthier start.”
The rollout of the malaria vaccine has begun to shift outcomes in some of the world’s hardest-hit places. Since 2022, Malawi has embedded the malaria vaccine into routine immunisation across 11 districts, pairing delivery with community training. At one Lilongwe clinic, 3,061 children were vaccinated in 2025 alone. “The fight against malaria here is not loud or dramatic. It unfolds in early-morning walks, in classrooms and village meetings, in patient explanations and quiet decisions. And with every vaccinated child, a centuries-old disease loses a little more ground.” UNICEF  
United States overdose deaths dropped about 21% in the 12 months to August 2025, extending the longest sustained decline in decades. Deaths fell in 45 states, down to roughly 73,000 from 92,000 a year earlier, though levels remain above pre-pandemic norms. Researchers link the reversal to wider naloxone access, expanded treatment, shifts in drug supply and changing use patterns, marking a rare nationwide improvement in a long-worsening crisis. Los Angeles Times 
Robberies and burglaries are down 80–90% in the United States. Our World in Data  has some fascinating charts of American crime trends from 1979 to 2024, showing that the country is the safest its been in half a century. If we include the double-digit falls in 2025 , robberies are down 80% since their peak in 1991 , and burglaries have fallen almost 90% since 1980 . Murders have not fallen quite as much, but are still down by more than half since 1980. Stefan Schubert 
Uzbekistan has reduced maternal mortality nearly five-fold, from 65.3 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1991 to 14.8 today, alongside steep falls in infant mortality (35.5 → nine per 1,000 births) and under-five mortality (48.2 → 12.5 per 100,000 births). Officials attribute the gains to preventive care, stronger primary health services and sustained maternal-health policy. Kun.uz 
Alcohol consumption in the United States has declined to its lowest level in 90 years. Young people are leading the way, with alcohol-free lifestyles being perceived as a way to safeguard health and one’s wallet. In response, alcohol-free bars, like New York’s Hecate, are spreading from a handful of cities to dozens nationwide, reframing nightlife around social connection rather than intoxication. DW 
Iraq has cut poverty from 23% of the population to 17.5% over the last three years, credited by officials to expanded social protection programs, the food ration system, and targeted support in education and health sectors. The current poverty threshold sets minimum monthly needs at US$105 per person, or US$535 for a family of five. Iraqi News 
Malawi’s newly-elected president, 85-year-old Peter Mutharika, has scrapped almost all school fees nationwide , delivering on his campaign promise to make public education free at primary and secondary level from 2026. The government expects enrolment to rise sharply, but officials warn that classrooms, teachers and materials must now scale just as fast for access gains to hold (FWIW Vietnam abolished state school fees in September 2025, and Japan got rid of secondary school fees last year too).
Environment & Conservation
Brazil commits to conserving 80% of the Amazon by 2030. Brazil has published its long-delayed UN biodiversity plan, pledging to conserve 80% of the Amazon, eliminate deforestation across all biomes by 2030, and align nature protection with climate policy. “Long-delayed” makes it sound bad, but for the world’s most biodiverse nation, the scale of ambition shifts the global baseline, and that’s gorgeous. Implementation depends on funding and enforcement. Carbon Brief 
China restored about 84,700 km² of land in 2025, including 36,000 km² of new forests and large-scale grassland recovery. Forest cover has reached 25%, although a lot of that is plantations. During its last five year plan, from 2021 to 2025, China rehabilitated 366,000 km² and treated more than 101,000 km² of desertified land, achieving an unprecedented decline in land degradation. China Daily 
Engineered American chestnuts pass their biggest real-world test yet. In the largest field trial so far, genetically modified American chestnut saplings showed sustained resistance to the fungus that wiped out roughly four billion trees last century. 261 transgenic chestnuts in Maine, carrying a wheat gene that neutralises fungal toxins, developed smaller cankers and shed fewer spores than wild types, while maintaining normal growth under drought stress. bioRxiv 
Norway will not issue licenses for deep-sea mining during the current parliamentary term, freezing plans to open Arctic waters to seabed extraction until at least 2029. The pause followed budget negotiations with left-wing and Green parties and halts a process Norway launched in 2024 to mine polymetallic nodules for battery minerals. Ministers frame the move as a delay, but it blocks all commercial activity this decade and strengthens calls for a wider moratorium. Euronews 
Viet Nam and Laos move toward binding river data-sharing pact. The two countries announced they will sign a transboundary water cooperation agreement by mid-2026, creating shared data systems for rivers spanning both countries. The deal would establish an inter-ministerial committee to coordinate monitoring of flows, water quality and hydropower impacts. Backed by Global Environment Facility funding and implemented by the FAO and IUCN, the agreement signals an important shift from parallel national plans to joint river governance. IUCN 
Chilean Patagonia secures permanent protection for Cochamó. A local coalition has raised over $78 million to permanently protect 1,330 km² of wilderness in Chile’s Cochamó Valley, ending years of development risk. The land anchors a four million-acre transboundary conservation network, safeguards carbon-rich forests and river systems, and will place at least 80% under strict protection. The Nature Conservancy 
Ghana has repealed a 2022 regulation that allowed presidential approval of mining in forest reserves, reinstating long-standing protections for biodiverse and carbon-rich forests. Parliament revoked the law in December after sustained civil-society pressure, re-closing reserves and making them off-limits to mining. Campaigners call it a governance reset, while warning that illegal mining and weak enforcement still threaten forest recovery. Mongabay 
India’s top court redraws renewable grid to protect a vanishing bird. India’s Supreme Court has finalised new safeguards for the critically endangered Great Indian Bustard, reshaping Green Energy Corridor routes across Rajasthan and Gujarat. The ruling protects 14,800km² of priority habitat, restricts new wind and large solar projects, and funnels transmission into narrow corridors, forcing reroutes but avoiding a blanket undergrounding mandate. Down To Earth 
Energy & Climate
Not news to our regular readers, but now it’s official: China burned fewer fossil fuels in 2025 than in 2024, despite massive power demand growth. We’ve already linked a lot on how countries are decoupling growth from emissions, China more than many, but it’s nice to have concrete end-of-year numbers from the world’s largest emitter. Bloomberg  & Reuters .
California grid hits eight-day clean power streak. Wind, water and sunshine met more than 100% of California’s electricity demand for eight straight days in January, an unprecedented run (so much for the winter doldrums). Compared with 2023, gas generation is down 66%, battery output is up 387%, solar up 127%, and total WWS generation increased 29%. Mark Jacobson 
Cheap solar and batteries are displacing diesel across rural Nigeria, lifting incomes and extending business hours after dark. Imports of solar panels jumped to 1,721 MW in the year to June 2025, up from under 500 MW in 2021, supplying about 5% of national demand. Backed by a $750 million programme from the World Bank Group, distributed solar is restoring power where the grid has failed, and local economies are booming as a result. Bloomberg 
Ireland has dismantled its first commercial wind farm to make way for a step-change in scale. At Bellacorick Wind Farm, 21 early-generation turbines have been removed so Oweninny Wind Farm can expand. Each new turbine now generates more power than the entire 1992 Bellacorick site, illustrating how three decades of innovation have radically compressed land use while multiplying output. RTE 
Oh… and China just installed the first ever 20MW wind turbine .
Trump just suffered a major loss in his war on offshore wind. Three federal judges, including a Trump appointee, rejected the administration’s attempt to halt construction of major projects off New England, New York and Virginia, ruling that vague national security claims did not justify stop-work orders. The decisions allow multibillion-dollar wind farms to proceed, reinforcing that political hostility alone is insufficient grounds to block permitted clean-energy infrastructure. Politico 
India posts record solar build as rooftop and utility surge. India added 37.9 GW of solar PV in 2025, a 54.7% jump year on year and its largest annual increase on record. Rooftop solar rose 72% after subsidies kicked in. Combined with an 85% rise in wind additions, renewables now total about 258 GW, over half from solar. PV Tech 
Solar overtakes both coal and fossil gas in Germany; renewables now generate 55% of electricity in the world’s fourth-largest economy. Germany generated 18% of its electricity from solar in 2025, up from 14% in 2024, pushing solar past both coal and gas despite the country’s relative lack of sunshine and high latitude. Long-running rooftop incentives and low costs have largely replaced lost nuclear capacity with solar and wind. Electrek 
Once upon a time the United Kingdom approved power projects on a first-come, first-served basis, which led to a backlog of power projects not ready for primetime. But now a UK grid queue reform has cleared out the 700GW backlog and fast-tracked 283GW of ready power, almost all wind, battery and solar, with a bit of fossil gas for balancing the load (but no more unabated fossil!) Renewables Now 
Solar shouldered most of US power demand growth last year, despite enormous new demand from (mostly) data centres. Generation rose by enough to cover all new daytime demand and, with battery capacity up 133%, part of the evening surge as well. Growth was highest in demand hotspots like Texas and the Midwest, showing that solar is scaling quickest where grids are under pressure. Ember 
Science & Technology
We’ve finally mapped Antarctica underneath all that ice. “Despite being identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a crucial boundary condition for projections of global sea level rise, less is known about the topography beneath the ice of Antarctica than any other planetary surface in the inner solar system…” 
… so starts Helen Ockden’s paper introducing her team’s new map of the land beneath the Antarctic ice. Scientists have been trying to map Antarctica’s sub-surface for decades using ground radar, which can only see what’s directly below it, and is heavy, which means it’s hard to lug around. This means our maps of Antarctica’s under-ice surface have really enormous gaps, but that’s now changing, thanks to the heroic work of Ockenden and her team at France’s Grenoble Alpes University. 
Using optical imagery from satellites and shallow-penetrating satellite radar, Ockenden and her team created a map by estimating elevations across the surface before using long-established equations that govern how ice interacts with landforms below it to model the exact bumps and dips in the bedrock. Comparing their output to existing regions of radar observations from the ground, they confirmed this method yields a realistic map of the subglacial landscape.
You can see the map and read the original paper here , or read the BBC’s nice report (in plainer language) over here .
We used to think that dolphins sometimes mobbed killer whales and ‘stole their scraps’ — but according to new research killer whales and dolphins actually coordinate hunting. Alternating bursts of echolocation, dolphins sometimes act as scouts for killer whales: the orcas take down prey that would be too big for dolphins, and let the dolphins have the scraps. Nature 
Super-shipwreck found in Denmark. In Medieval Europe ships called cogs revolutionised shipping simply by their size: they were the biggest things to ever hit the water. We’ve never found an intact cog before though, so everything we know about them comes from drawings, and mostly-decayed wrecks. Until now! A cog named Svælget 2 was recently found off the coast of Copenhagen: it’s 28 metres from bow to stern and, preserved under sand, its rigging is still intact. Archaeologists were particularly excited to find a brick-and-tile fireplace on the ship’s deck, a remarkable bit of comfort that allowed sailors to have hot meals. Ars Technica 
Puppies are a gateway drug to parenthood. Birth rates are down and pet ownership is up, especially ‘amongst the youth’ which has led to a few hysterical headlines about dogs replacing babies. But now Taiwanese scientists have found that people who adopt dogs are actually more likely than their pet-less peers to subsequently have kids. SSRN 
Finding the intact genome of a prehistoric animal: exciting. Finding the intact genome of a prehistoric animal dating back to when that animal was going extinct: a potential gold mine. In the stomach of a beautifully preserved Siberian wolf pup, we’ve found a hairy chunk of meat from a woolly rhino killed almost 14,400 years ago, just before that species’ extinction. Researchers from Sweden, Wales, Denmark and Russia describe how they decoded the woolly rhino’s genome from the matted piece of meat. What’d they find? Well, if the woolly rhino died out slowly, you’d expect to see genetic erosion: harmful mutations in the genome from inbreeding due to smaller population size. The researchers found no such effects, which means the population probably died out quickly. Next big question: was it us? NBC 
Fun fact: The pup that ate the woolly rhino is called Tumat-1, and was found, along with his sister in the Siberian permafrost. Both pups died suddenly at nine weeks old, probably due to den collapse.
Very little in life is truly random. A coin flip is influenced by the flipper, the surrounding airflow, and gravity. Similar variables dictate rolling a pair of dice or shuffling a deck of cards, and even cryptographic algorithms in computing are theoretically susceptible to outside influence or bias. True randomness is something that nothing in the universe can predict in advance, and now we have a source of it, thanks to scientists who used quantum mechanics to construct an actually random number generator . The generator is now online and can be used by anyone, entirely for free: check out the University of Colorado Randomness Beacon . 
Robots are finding treasure in the trash. There’s riches in America’s garbage; plastic bottles ready for reclamation, scrap metal Trump’s tariffs have made valuable, cardboard boxes that could save pulp mills a pretty penny (or maybe now a nickel). All of it ‘should’ be recycled; most of it still ends up in a landfill. But no more! Enter the robots with pneumatic pickers, separating garbage with quick puffs of air, more than 1,000 pieces per minute, with item recognition provided by AI. WSJ 
Enceladus may be the most likely place to harbour life in our solar system. Under its icy crust, we know Saturn’s sixth-largest moon, Enceladus, has a subsurface ocean, kept warm and chemically complex by tidal stresses. Now scientists have re-created the conditions experienced by Enceladus’ subsurface ocean in the lab, repeatedly freezing and thawing a mixture of simple compounds previously found in plumes of water on Enceladus, including ammonia and hydrogen cyanide. These artificial hydrothermal reactions produced an array of more complex molecules, including amino acids, aldehydes, and nitriles, the building blocks of life. Phys.org
