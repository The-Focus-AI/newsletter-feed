Welcome to 2026. Thanks for your patience while we were on our summer break, Sammy and I had two lovely weeks on the Sapphire Coast of Australia. Lola is nut brown and brave enough to swim under the waves now, Cleo got stung by a bluebottle and flew a kite for the first time, and Juno managed to eat her bodyweight in beach sand. 
While we started the year slowly, the same is not true of the news. Things feel insane. A reminder - while we’ve been following all that stuff too, you won’t find any coverage of it here, because you’re already drowning in it. Both legacy and social media are explicitly designed to show you what’s breaking, what’s terrifying, what’s going wrong. We’re trying to offer a correction to the distortion. 
The stories you’re about to read are just as important, if not more so, than the chaos currently dominating your feed, but they’re invisible because they don’t generate the emotional charge required to break through. Progress doesn’t spike cortisol. Disease elimination doesn’t trigger shares. That doesn’t stop them from happening though. 
This week: Iraq offers a counterpoint in the Middle East, trachoma exposure falls below 100 million worldwide (down from 1.5 billion in 2002), coal power drops simultaneously in India and China for the first time since 1973, astonishing progress in the fight against cancer, and how conservationists saved one of the world’s most beautiful species of antelope.
Our version of the news isn’t more true than the one you’re seeing everywhere else, but it is a lot harder to find. If it helps, please share it! 
This week’s top stories
The WHO  just released new data showing the number of people exposed to trachoma worldwide has fallen below 100 million, down from over 1.5 billion in 2002, signalling an extraordinary reduction in the world’s leading infectious cause of blindness. The WHO’s SAFE strategy - surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement - is working, with elimination now validated in 27 countries.
Iraq is ‘unrecognisable and remarkable’ after years of conflict (that’s a nice thing to write). According to the United Nations the country has emerged from two decades of conflict into a more stable phase, with poverty falling to 17.5% and security improvements enabling about five million internally displaced people to return home. Recent parliamentary elections saw a 56% turnout, up 12 points on the previous vote, and a third of the candidates were women. UN News 
Global vaccine development has moved from serendipity to precision engineering. Saloni Dattani  on how advances in microscopy, cell culture, genomics and mRNA platforms are now letting scientists design vaccines atom by atom, with a turnaround of just weeks. After more than a century of slow iteration, the pace has sharply accelerated, with multiple diseases getting their first ever vaccines in the past five years. 
In the next few years we can expect:
- A universal flu vaccine.
- Next-generation COVID-19 vaccines with broader, longer-lasting protection.
- Personalised cancer vaccines, starting with melanoma.
- Malaria vaccines with higher efficacy and longer durability.
- Tuberculosis vaccines providing adult protection.
- Second-generation RSV vaccines for more age groups.
- Safe dengue vaccines without the need for prior infection screening.
- Gonorrhoea vaccines reducing antimicrobial resistance pressure.
- Chlamydia vaccines targeting the most common bacterial STI.
Ocean protection rose to 9.6% of global waters in 2025, a 1.2-point increase driven by some very large designations. The biggest moves came from French Polynesia’s planned 4.8 million km² reserve, Samoa’s nine new MPAs covering 30% of its ocean, and new protections in the Philippines, Pakistan and the Marshall Islands.

Happy Public Domain Day! On January 1, 2026, Nancy Drew entered the public domain, as did the papers of Hannah Arendt and Albert Einstein, Langston Hughes’ Not Without Laughter and Dashiell Hammett’s The Maltese Falcon. For more works entering the public domain this year, check out the Public Domain Review .
Global cancer deaths have doubled since 1980, but this reflects population growth and ageing, not treatment failure. Once age is accounted for, cancer deaths have fallen by more than 20%. What that means is that for people of the same age, the likelihood of dying from cancer is now significantly lower than four decades ago, reflecting real progress in prevention, detection and care. Our World in Data 
Also, in the United States: “Seven in 10 people now survive their cancer for five years or more, up from only half in the mid-70s. This stunning victory is largely the result of decades of cancer research that provided clinicians with the tools to treat the disease more effectively, turning many cancers from a death sentence into a chronic disease.” US Cancer Statistics 2025 
Oh, and in Britain, the first leukaemia patient just received CAR-T cell therapy on the NHS .  “Usually, this type of leukaemia is aggressive and patients don’t live beyond 6–8 months. With this, we are able to offer them years and potentially a cure.”
Coal power falls in both India and China. In 2025, coal-fired electricity generation fell simultaneously in India and China for the first time since 1973. India cut coal power 3% and China 1.6% as record solar, wind and storage additions outpaced rising demand. Together, these two countries account for roughly 40% of global annual CO₂ emissions from fossil fuels and industry. Guardian 
Given this, it’s perhaps unsurprising that global seaborne coal exports fell 5% in 2025, the first annual decline since 2020, driven mainly by lower imports across Asia. China cut thermal coal imports 12% as clean power surged, while India’s imports fell by 3%, raising the prospect that global coal trade has peaked. Reuters 
The United States Congress has moved to overturn President Trump’s proposed 22% cut to federal science spending, rejecting  what would have been the steepest reduction since World War II. NASA in particular is breathing a sigh of relief: spared a 75% cut in science funding, projects including the Dragonfly to Titan  mission and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope  are now safe. 
The US Senate has also rejected Trump’s proposed $1 billion cut to National Park Service funding, instead advancing  a bipartisan bill that includes provisions to retain and rehire staff, require congressional notice of any mass firings, and protect conservation and maintenance funding. Plus, a US appeals court has upheld an injunction preventing the National Institutes of Health from imposing a flat 15% cap on indirect cost payments to universities .
Chinese scientists have created a hybrid rice that reproduces clonally through its seeds, locking in high-yield traits across generations without annual repurchasing. The advance tackles the main constraint limiting hybrid rice uptake, particularly in low-income regions. With hybrids already delivering up to fourfold yield gains in parts of Africa, clonal varieties could dramatically lift global food output. South China Morning Post 
Pakistan and Rwanda have both registered measurable progress against child stunting. Over the last five years Pakistan’s  Nashonuma Programme cut stunting among under-twos by 6.4% and among six-month-old babies by an “enormous” 20%. Rwanda  lowered national stunting from 33% to 27% between 2020 and 2025, halving the number of high-burden districts and reducing acute malnutrition, showing sustained nutrition policies are delivering gains across very different contexts.
South Korea has ended bear bile farming, formally banning the breeding, possession and bile extraction of bears under strengthened animal welfare laws. The decision follows a 2022 agreement between the government, farmers and animal rights groups, as demand for bear bile collapsed amid cruelty concerns and medical alternatives. Associated Press 
London recorded 97 homicides in 2025, pushing the city’s homicide rate to 1.1 per 100,000 - the lowest level since current records began. Metropolitan Police . 
The results speak for themselves: fewer lives lost, fewer families shattered. Every murder is a tragedy, but we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to drive down serious violence.
Sir Mark Rowley, Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis
New York City just recorded the lowest number of shootings in its history. There were 688 shooting incidents in 2025, the lowest total ever, while murders dropped 20.2% year-on-year and major crime declined 3% overall. CBS News

Meet five new species discovered in 2025: live-birthing toads in Tanzania, a smiley snailfish from the deep sea, a mini-marsupial in the Andes, an undercover spider in California, and, from the fossil record, a long-extinct sea cow that lived in the Persian Gulf and was an ‘ecosystem engineer’ much like today’s manatees and dugongs. NPR 
Neither jellyfish nor sea anemones have brains. But these animals sleep in ways strikingly similar to humans .
And finally, the scimitar-horned oryx has been brought back from extinction through captive breeding. After wild populations vanished in the 1980s, the antelope has now been re-established in Chad through one of the most complex rewilding efforts ever attempted. Following decades of coordinated breeding in European and U.S. institutions, the turning point came in March 2016, when 25 oryx from a genetically curated “World Herd” were released into the Ouadi Rimé–Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve, an area larger than Ireland. Since then, 347 animals have been reintroduced and around 600 now roam free, prompting the IUCN in 2023 to downgrade the species from “extinct in the wild” to “endangered.” BBC Future

Global labour market recovery gathers pace despite lingering risks
The International Labor Organisation  says global employment has largely stabilised, with labour force participation rising and job growth returning across most regions. Real wages are recovering after recent inflation shocks, especially in advanced economies, while female employment and youth participation continue to improve. 
Brazil has been certified as having eliminated mother‑to‑child transmission of HIV as a public health problem, the first country of more than 100 million people to do so. Vertical transmission of HIV has dropped to below 2% and coverage for prenatal care has reached over 95%. Brazilian Minister of Health, Alexandre Padilha, attributed the milestone to “a collective, national, and global effort that has consolidated free access to antiretroviral therapy and modern prevention strategies in the country.” POZ 
From Sam Matey-Coste : Médecins Sans Frontières has completed a full round of R21 malaria vaccine deployment for children in the Kule refugee camp in Ethiopia. Kule is home to over 55,000 refugees from South Sudan, and has been ravaged by malaria in recent years. 2,100 children under the age of five received their fourth and final dose of R21 in November 2025. It’s the first full vaccination round against malaria carried out in a refugee camp anywhere in the world.
Now my children have all the doses of the vaccine, and I feel hope. I can see them growing up healthy, even with all the problems we face here. My child is four years old and vaccinated. He has not been sick the whole of this year! But before he used to get sick of malaria twice a year.

The Philippines saw a series of legal and civic breakthroughs in 2025 that rolled back systemic repression. Courts struck down website bans, dismissed terrorism and defamation charges against journalists, activists and Indigenous leaders, and ordered the return of misused health funds. Alongside these rulings, award-winning independent films and mass student protests sustained pressure for free expression, accountability and democratic space, showing coordinated resistance can still constrain the abuse of power. Bulatlat 
Grenada has set 18 as the minimum legal age for marriage, eliminating parental or judicial consent provisions that previously enabled child marriage at age 16 or 17. The reform brings national law into line with international human rights standards and applies equally to girls and boys. Girls Not Brides 
Albania has passed a sweeping gender equality law requiring balanced representation across political institutions, and shifting the burden of proof in gender-based violence cases from victims to perpetrators. Not all provisions made it through (lawmakers rejected explicit references to “gender identity” for instance) but it’s still a substantive advance, especially after mass disinformation campaigns tried to stall reforms.

Authorities in the Faroe Islands have brought the first-ever animal-abuse charges against dolphin hunters, resulting in the suspension of whale and dolphin drives. The case centres on a hunt (known locally as grindadráp) in June 2024 in which 90 pilot whales were left trapped in shallow water for 27 hours after more than 100 were killed, breaching welfare rules. The case could force a reckoning for one of humanity’s most horrific animal cruelty traditions. Oceanographic Magazine 
France’s ban on forever chemicals enters into force. The new law, approved by lawmakers in February 2025, bans the production, import or sale of any product for which an alternative to PFAS already exists, including in cosmetics, clothing and ski wax. Some industrial exemptions remain, but the move sets a regulatory benchmark likely to shape future EU-wide standards. France 24 
A Love Island for Lizards. A cross-Caribbean matchmaking project has helped rescue the critically endangered Lesser Antillean iguana on the uninhabited islet of Prickly Pear East, near Anguilla. After invasive green iguanas drove the species to extinction across much of its range, conservationists relocated 23 survivors to the island in 2016. To prevent inbreeding, the project later recruited ten healthy young iguanas from Dominica, who, chaperoned by conservationists, boarded a small plane in 2021 and flew to Anguilla to find a (soul)mate. Less than five years on, surveys count more than 300 adults and juveniles, making the islet one of only five places worldwide where the species is now increasing. Euronews 
Protecting large predatory fish on the Great Barrier Reef almost certainly prevented a major ecological tipping point, avoiding near-continuous outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish (large, spiny coral-eating invertebrates that can devastate reefs when populations explode). Measures introduced in 2004, including expanding no-take zones to about 33% and tightening fishing rules, helped preserve food-web controls on the starfish. Without them, outbreaks could have been four times more widespread, leaving far less coral. ConnectSci 
Chile moves to lock in a 2,800km Patagonia wildlife corridor. Chile is preparing to designate Cape Froward as a national park, protecting about 2,000km² of remote Patagonian coastline, forests and carbon-rich peatlands. The move would complete a decade long public–private conservation effort to create a continuous 2,800km wildlife corridor at the southern tip of the Americas, safeguarding habitat for endangered huemul deer, river otters and pumas. The Guardian 
I have been to many exceptional places, and I can tell you that Cape Froward is the wildest place I have walked through.

Ecuador’s highest court has blocked construction of a highway threatening the critically endangered jambato toad, a species found nowhere else on Earth but in the parish of Angamarca, in Cotopaxi province.  The judge ordered all use of heavy machinery halted until comprehensive environmental studies on the road’s projected impact on the jambato toad are completed and a species protection plan is approved. Ecuador is the only country in the world whose constitution recognizes nature’s rights to exist, regenerate and be restored. Inside Climate News 
Vulnerable species on Australia’s Kangaroo Island are reappearing, five years after bushfires destroyed over 90% of key habitat. A predator-proof enclosure around the Western River Refuge has driven 90–100% population increases in species such as the dunnart and western whipbird, surprising even ecologists with the rate of bounce back. ABC News 
After two decades of work by BirdLife South Africa’s “Albatross Task Force”, deaths of seabirds from fishing have fallen by about 90%. Albatrosses are killed when they dive for bait on longlines or become entangled in cables and dragged under. The fix is low-tech: bird-scaring lines, cheap streamers that deter birds during line setting, much like a scarecrow. The stakes are high: albatrosses mate for life, lay one egg every two years, and the loss of a single parent usually dooms the chick, making bycatch disproportionately destructive. BBC 
Energy & Climate
Most of the global economy is now growing without rising emissions: an analysis from late last year found that economies representing 92% of global GDP have decoupled their economic growth from their CO₂ emissions since the Paris Agreement, either absolutely or relatively. Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit 
Science  named renewable energy its Breakthrough of the Year for 2025. The graph below says it all.
In 2004, it took the world a full year to install 1 gigawatt of solar power capacity. Today, twice that amount goes online each day. Back then renewables had an aura of virtue: Buyers paid a premium over fossil energy because of climate concerns. Now, the real driver is self-interest: lower cost and greater energy security. That change in motivation may be the most important breakthrough of all, ensuring that this year’s inflection points are just the beginning.
California to turn water-starved farmland into 21GW solar hub. The state is planning to repurpose drought-stricken farmland in the San Joaquin Valley into up to 21GW of solar power, one of the world’s largest proposed solar build-outs. Enabled by new state law, the plan converts land lost to chronic water shortages into clean energy, jobs and revenue, while supporting California’s renewable targets and easing pressure on scarce water supplies. IE 
2025 was the United Kingdom’s first full year without coal power since 1881 , as wind, solar and biomass all reached record highs, and renewables supplied 47% of electricity. 
Related: Did you know the North Sea is the largest offshore wind basin in the world ? It’s home to 101 operational wind farms making up 30GW, giving it a greater capacity than the South or East China seas. It also has a significant pipeline of projects in construction or in early development, including 8.4GW of new wind just secured by the British government, the largest single procurement  in European history. 
No transition without transmission: Australia completes all towers on its biggest ever power line. All 1,500 steel towers on the 700 kilometre EnergyConnect project (the country’s largest transmission build) are up, linking New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The multi-billion dollar line is designed to move large volumes of renewable electricity as coal retires. The line gets switched on in late 2026. Renew Economy 
Africa’s solar market hits take-off speed with record panel imports. Africa imported more than 2GW of solar panels in a single month for the first time in November 2025, marking a clear acceleration in solar adoption across the continent. Data tracking Chinese exports show sharp year-on-year surges in countries from Algeria and Egypt to Zambia and the DRC, with growth driven by a mix of utility-scale projects, mining demand and distributed rooftops.

‘Bubble batteries’ move from prototype to global rollout. Italy-based Energy Dome has begun operating a 20MW CO₂ “battery” that stores surplus solar and wind power by compressing and expanding carbon dioxide inside a giant dome. More of these are now planned across Europe, the United States and Asia. Unlike lithium-ion batteries, the technology avoids critical minerals, lasts decades, and becomes cheaper at larger scales, tackling one of the harder limits of renewable grids. IEEE

AI model turns a single night’s sleep into long-term disease forecasts. Researchers at Stanford  have trained an AI model to predict the risk of 130 diseases using data from one night of sleep. Drawing on polysomnography (an overnight study of sleep which takes place in a specialised laboratory) and up to 25 years of health records from 35,000 patients, the model achieved strong predictive accuracy for conditions including Parkinson’s, dementia, heart disease and several cancers. 
Will this artificial star power tomorrow? China’s fusion reactor smashes a key plasma density limit. China’s EAST ‘artificial sun’ has overcome a long‑standing density limit in tokamak plasmas, an important step toward more efficient fusion reactors. Science Daily 
Seven-million-year-old femur pushes back the human family tree. A newly identified feature in a Sahelanthropus femur from Chad confirms the ape walked upright, making it the oldest known hominin by roughly one million years. Using 3D morphometrics, researchers found a femoral tubercle linked to bipedal balance, absent in other apes. The finding resolves a two-decade dispute and sharpens estimates of when human and chimpanzee lineages diverged. Science Advances 
An excavation of a Roman Fort  just south of Hadrian’s wall shows how parasites (and not just angry Celts) may have helped thwart invading Romans in Britain. Archaeologists analysing sewer drains at Vindolanda found that the soldiers manning the fort were plagued by at least three different intestinal parasites – roundworm, whipworm and Giardia duodenalis. The parasites spread due to contact between food, drink or hands and human faeces; waste travelled down the communal latrine to a stream north of the site. Roman sewer systems, even on the frontier, were aesthetically quite sophisticated, but with an incomplete understanding of vectors, nice-looking sewers didn’t fully protect the Romans from disease.(For more on the secular cathedrals that are modern sewer systems, check out Charles C. Mann’s “A Spring In Every Kitchen .”)
Cyberpunk alert: Scientists have successfully turned giant panda skin cells into giant panda stem cells , and are planning to use those giant panda stem cells to make giant panda embryos. 
One of PopSci’s favorite inventions of last year: an eyedrop that corrects age-related farsightedness for up to ten hours at a time . And if that’s not letting you see far enough, how about these infrared contacts that let you see in the dark, even with your eyes closed ? 
Playing whimsical video games may reduce burnout risk  in young adults. The study has a pretty small sample size, but wouldn’t that be nice? Also well-designed gardens can relax us immediately , according to a study from (where else?) Kyoto. 
Scientists have discovered the root cause of lupus and a possible way to reverse it. A study published in Nature  points to abnormalities in the immune system of lupus patients: specifically, “people with lupus have too much of a particular T cell associated with damage in healthy cells and too little of another T cell associated with repair.” A protein called interferon is mainly to blame for the T-cell imbalance, and the study found that giving people with lupus anifrolumab, a drug that blocks interferon, prevented the T-cell imbalance that likely leads to the disease. 
Plus, a new hepatitis B drug  could help ‘functionally cure’ some patients.
And finally, here’s an incomplete list of space events to look forward to this year: the United States is sending astronauts back towards the moon, courtesy of Artemis II, and maybe landing on the moon, courtesy of Artemis III (though that’s seen delays). China is also planning a moon landing, though the timeline for that one has been kept secret, but last year saw their manned lunar lander test successfully on Earth. Meanwhile, Japan is launching an unmanned mission to Phobos, Mars’s largest moon, to collect samples, and possibly shed light on its strange origins. NASA’s next generation Roman Space Telescope is also scheduled for launch this year, putting infrared eyes in space, while on the 12th August, the moon will slide between Earth and the sun, causing a total solar eclipse that starts in Northern Russia and ends over the Mediterranean Sea.
