Hi everyone, we’re thrilled to introduce you to our first charity partner for 2026, Dogs4Wildlife . Run by professional police and military K9 trainers Darren Priddle and Jacqui Law, they’re teaching dogs to become elite wildlife protectors across the African continent. Their latest project transforms rescue dogs in Zimbabwe into conservation assets working alongside African Parks in Matusadona National Park.
We’re sending them AUD$20,000 to build a specialised training and agility area at a new sanctuary just outside Harare. The sanctuary will serve two purposes: it’ll provide critical training infrastructure for seven conservation dogs currently in training, building their confidence, coordination and problem-solving abilities, while also giving more than 450 rescue dogs a space to play, explore and thrive.
Darren and Jacqui told us that for the conservation dogs, structured enrichment and agility work is essential for developing trust with handlers and ensuring they enjoy their training. For the wider sanctuary population, it’s a permanent space where they can express natural behaviours, reduce stress, and simply be dogs. 
Thanks to all of you, our premium subscribers, for making this donation possible. This sanctuary will benefit both African wildlife and rescue dogs for years to come.
This week’s top stories
The world just passed eight years and four months without a nuclear explosion, the longest period since the atomic era began  more than 80 years ago. The most recent test was in North Korea on September 3rd 2017. That’s a welcome milestone: Daniel Ellsberg (the guy who leaked the Pentagon Papers) skipped a retirement fund assuming a nuclear holocaust would arrive first. Could someone please share this news with the Doomsday Clock  people? Vox 
Since 2021, poverty has declined in most countries, but progress is uneven. Three in four countries in the world saw a decline in poverty between 2021 and 2024, signalling a broad recovery after the shock of the pandemic. Countries mired in conflict and violence continue to confront the steepest challenges, but things are starting to look up (slowly) - the World Bank  estimates that four in five countries saw poverty decline in 2025, the largest share in ten years.
The mental health of America’s students is improving. UCLA  surveyed 84,000+ students across 135 campuses nationwide, and found severe depression fell to 18% in 2025 (down from 23% in 2022), and suicidal thoughts fell to 11% (from 15%). Loneliness is still high and only one in three students said they were ‘flourishing’; still, the results reflect an important counter narrative to the constant headlines about young people’s mental health. 
India is going green faster than China did at the same income level. Cheap solar, wind and batteries are allowing the world’s largest country to bypass a fossil-heavy growth phase. As Bill McKibben  notes, costs have flipped so dramatically that renewables now undercut coal itself, opening a credible path for emerging economies to grow as “electrostates” that are built on clean electricity rather than fossil fuels. Ember 
In 2025, wind and solar generated more electricity than fossil fuels in the EU, while nuclear provided an additional 23%. Gas, coal and oil only generated 29%, with coal becoming increasingly marginal at 9.2%. A big shout out for solar, which now generates a cool (or should we say ‘hot’?) 13% of electricity for more than 450 million people across the continent. Ember 
Australia’s clean energy transition is going better than almost anyone realises. In the last quarter of 2025 renewables supplied a record 51% of the country’s electricity, with wind, solar and batteries each at all-time highs. The share of fossil gas is at its lowest since 2000, coal power is at its lowest level ever, emissions are down, and wholesale electricity prices have plunged by 44%. The figures show a system shifting faster than the public debate has caught up with yet. AEMO 
And in case you were worried about the United States…
99% of new US capacity in 2026 will be solar, wind + storage.  (EIA)

Meanwhile, deforestation keeps falling across the Amazon — 
In Brazil, deforestation in the Amazon is down to its lowest level since 2014. At COP30, President Lula recognised 24,500 km² of Indigenous territories, with another 45,000 km² in the pipeline; funders pledged $1.8 billion for land rights and $100 million for wildfire prevention. Context 
In Colombia, new figures show forest lost from January to September 2025 is down 25% compared to the same period in 2024. Officials credit a government-led plan that leans on Indigenous collaboration, rural land-use zoning, restoration and voluntary conservation deals, as well as cash incentives. Mongabay 
And on the border with Peru and Brazil, Bolivia recently added two new protected areas to stitch the western Amazon together. Created by municipal governments, the 7,300 km² of intact forest, rivers and floodplains will give jaguars, tapirs, river dolphins, giant otters and spider monkeys corridors to move around vast territories. Andes Amazon Fund 
If you want to go deeper, check out Oliver Gordon’s excellent solutions journalism deep dive on food forests in Brazil. The indigenous practice of agroforestry is gaining traction in Brazil, replacing degraded pasture with mixed tree-crop systems that restore soils, cut emissions and raise incomes. So-called ‘food forests’ (dense, mixed plantings of fruit, nut and other productive trees) provide habitats for animals while also providing food (and income!) for farmers. Just Stories 
Heart disease deaths fall in the United States as pandemic surge recedes. According to new data from the American Heart Association  deaths from heart disease and stroke declined in 2023, reversing a multi-year rise linked to the pandemic. Around 25,000 fewer Americans died from heart disease than in 2022, with improvements in age-adjusted death rates. Despite the progress, heart disease and stroke still cause more than a quarter of all US deaths.
Soon, asymptomatic illnesses could see you glowing green. Rising inflammation in the body is one of the best ways to spot illness before symptoms show up. Now a Japanese team has found a way to bioengineer living skin to glow green when inflammation hits…currently in mice, maybe someday in humans. Upside: now you’ll know you’re ill before you start suffering, and be able to treat preemptively. Downside: you’ll have to plan your outfits a little more carefully. Nature 
Standard cannabis measurements are coming, and could do wonders for public health. Cannabis currently exists in a measurement grey zone; people talk about joints, bowls and gummies, but that rarely translates into how much THC someone actually consumes. Now scientists from the University of Bath have proposed a standardized THC unit for cannabis much like units for alcoholic drinks. Public health experts have welcomed the proposal, and if this (or any) cannabis standardisation sees pickup, it could help users pace themselves and doctors assess risk. Vice 
Veronika, a 13-year-old cow, has been filmed using sticks and a broom  as a bovine backscratcher. Her newly-recorded tool use is causing us to rethink what we know about cow intelligence, and the possibility of tool use among large mammals more generally. 
And in what may or may not count as tool use (apparently it’s controversial) last year, a wolf in British Columbia was caught on camera dismantling and robbing crab traps . If ‘dismantling crab traps’ does count, this is the first tool use recorded in a wild canid.
Hawaiʻi modernises parentage law, locking in protections for LGBTQ+ families. The new law replaces heteronormative, marriage-based rules with gender-neutral standards that recognise intended parents, assisted reproduction and surrogacy. The reform secures legal parentage for children born into LGBTQ+ families without requiring adoption or court orders after birth and closes gaps that left families vulnerable during medical emergencies or custody disputes. Kauaʻi Now 
Cycling surges in the world’s most iconic cities. Forget Waymo. Bikes and e-bikes are reshaping urban transport faster than autonomous taxis , helped by pandemic-era habits, cheaper batteries, and separated lanes. In London cyclists now outnumber cars in the financial district by two to one. In Paris, they now outnumber motorists across the whole city. Even in Beijing the number of cyclists is rising again - and as cities reallocate street space, we’re starting to see a “war on cars.” . Bring it on.
Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving taxi firm, proudly proclaims that its cars do around 250,000 trips a week. Yet in New York alone that number of trips is made every three days using the city’s bike-share scheme.
Bogotá’s care blocks are buying women their time back. Colombia’s capital is home to eight million people, and 1.2 million women who do more than ten hours a day of unpaid care. Since 2020 though, the city has opened 25 neighbourhood hubs where caregivers can drop off children or elderly relatives, do the laundry, then use free legal aid, training or mental-health support - or just sit down and read a book. The model is now spreading to Sierra Leone, Mexico and (soon) the United States. Vox

Human Progress
The WHO says the world saw genuine progress on disease elimination in 2025, despite the funding cuts in the headlines. The Maldives achieved “triple elimination” of mother-to-child HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B, Brazil ended vertical HIV transmission at national scale, seven more African countries began rolling out malaria vaccines and WHO member states adopted the Pandemic Agreement, turning COVID lessons into binding rules. UN News 
Kenya’s new ‘bundle’ approach is catching postpartum haemorrhage early.
In 2019 the Gates Foundation  funded a program in 80 hospitals for four years: half delivered routine care and half used a new ‘bundle’ approach (deploying uterine massage, medicines, IV fluids and quick exams all at once). The bundle approach detected postpartum haemorrhage in 93.1% of cases, cut severe bleeding by 60%, and reduced deaths by 33%. Kenya is now putting the approach into national guidelines.
Lithuania’s suicide rate has been cut by more than half. After the post-Soviet shock pushed deaths to 45 per 100,000, the rate fell to about 20 per 100,000 by 2021. Our World in Data  points to rising incomes, a 2007 National Mental Health Strategy, and a Suicide Prevention Bureau and action plan put into place a decade ago. The rate is still very high by European standards — nevertheless, progress.
China is prosecuting domestic violence earlier. Prosecutors say the share of cases charged as intentional injury or homicide fell from over 90% in 2021 to under 60% in 2025, because the system is catching a wider range of harm sooner. “Family” now includes cohabiting partners and psychological abuse counts as violence. China Daily 
India’s poorest households can now buy cars, fridges and cell phones. New data show India’s bottom 40% households are rapidly accumulating everyday assets long thought out of reach. In rural areas, motor-vehicle ownership rose from 6.2% to 47.1% between 2012 and 2024, while refrigerators climbed from 2.9% to 22.5%. Mobile phones are now near-universal across rich and poor alike. EAC-PM Working Paper 
Biden’s ‘American Rescue Plan Act’ was probably responsible for the great US crime decline. What’s behind the tumbling crime rate? Various factors have been hypothesised, including more policing, low unemployment and a post-pandemic snap-back, but researchers argue only one thing actually fits: under the Biden Administration, the American Rescue Plan Act pumped billions of dollars into prevention strategies, such as funding libraries and social workers. Baltimore offers a typical case: despite having 2,080 officers (down from 3,000+before the pandemic), ARPA cash helped build a violence-prevention office, fund outreach, summer jobs and safer public spaces, cutting homicides by nearly 60% in five years. The Atlantic 
Vietnam recorded an unprecedented decline in crime in 2025, with total offences down 19.2% year on year and major categories such as violent crime, drugs, corruption and environmental violations all falling. With police clearance rates exceeding targets for serious crimes, attention is now turning to unresolved fraud, food safety risks and asset recovery from corruption cases. Asia News Network 
Environment & Conservation
Indigenous fire stewardship brings rare Ontario prairie back. After nearly disappearing, the Black Oak Savanna at Alderville First Nation is thriving again thanks to 25 years of Indigenous-led restoration. Controlled burns, seed collection and invasive species removal have rebuilt one of Canada’s rarest ecosystems, where fewer than 1% of tallgrass prairies remain globally. The project shows how cultural practices can restore biodiversity, store carbon in soils and revive species once pushed to the brink. The Narwhal 
US court shuts down logging loophole used to bypass reviews. A federal judge in Oregon has ruled that the U.S. Forest Service unlawfully used a decades-old shortcut, known as CE-6, to approve large commercial logging projects without environmental review. The rule, created in the 90s for small, low-impact forest work, was regularly applied to projects covering more than 12,000 km² nationwide. The decision permanently blocks CE-6, forcing future logging projects to comply with environmental assessment requirements. Inside Climate News 
Norway to end fast-growing chicken breeds by 2027. Norway will become the first country to fully phase out fast-growing “frankenchicken” breeds, with its poultry industry committing to higher-welfare chickens by 2027. The shift affects around 70 million birds a year and follows years of transition to slower-growing breeds with fewer health problems. By July 2027, they will also stop killing day-old male chicks by switching to in-ovo sexing, which identifies male embryos before hatching. New Food Magazine 
Coral rehabilitation efforts are buying the Great Barrier Reef more time. Australia’s Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program, launched in 2018 and backed by nearly $300 million, now spans 300+ scientists across 20+ institutions, collecting coral spawn at sea and breeding heat-tolerant corals in a giant lab. It produced 35 million embryos last year and is aiming for 100 million corals a year that survive for at least 12 months or more. Vox 
Ethiopia’s Green Legacy plants billions of trees to stabilise landscapes and livelihoods. Since 2019, Ethiopia has planted more than 32 billion trees and seedlings across degraded hillsides, farms and river basins, tying reforestation directly to soil rehabilitation, flood control and rural incomes and transforming landscapes and livelihoods across the country. DW News 
Iowa revives oxbow wetlands to save a prairie fish and clean water. Efforts to recover the endangered Topeka shiner have restored more than 200 oxbow wetlands across Iowa, reversing decades of agricultural drainage. The excavated river meanders now support rebounding fish populations, with the species found in 60% of historic watersheds, up from 32% a decade earlier. Inside Climate News 
Scientists are ramping up an ambitious project to reverse centuries of ecological destruction on a Galápagos island. A $15 million ecological overhaul on Floreana Island is seeing rats, cats, and weeds removed across 173 km². Native wildlife is rebounding: beetles, reptiles, and birds are returning, and 19 captive-bred Floreana tortoises are set for release after local extinction in the 1850s. Scientists are also preparing to reintroduce the brujo flycatcher, using novel controls against parasitic flies that once caused near-total chick mortality. Science 
Energy & Climate
Governments see it. Communities feel it. Clean energy is faster to deploy, cheaper to run and more resilient in an increasingly volatile world. The good news is that momentum is building. Governments are renewing commitments. Global plans are being updated. The building blocks are in place. The technologies work. The costs are falling. And the evidence, from villages to entire nations, shows that clean energy delivers. 
Damilola Ogunbiyi, Co-Chair of UN-Energy 
Global battery demand jumps 29% as grid storage surges. Lithium-ion battery demand rose at a blistering pace in 2025, driven by rapid growth in energy storage. EVs still accounted for most of overall demand, but grid-scale battery energy storage systems grew fastest, up 51% year-on-year. The shift reflects accelerating investment in power grids, especially in North America and China. Benchmark Intelligence 
China begins construction on a vast clean-power corridor from Tibet to the coast
China has started building the southern section of an ultra-high-voltage power line linking Tibet’s hydropower, wind and solar resources to Guangdong’s factory hubs. Once completed in 2029, the line will deliver over 43 TWh of clean electricity annually, cutting coal use by about 12 million tonnes. That’s equivalent to the entire annual electricity consumption of Portugal - in a single transmission line.
A hidden solar boom is reshaping Pakistan and Africa. Solar deployment in Pakistan and across Africa is far larger than official figures suggest. In Pakistan, imports of solar panels exceeding 50 GW  imply far more than the 6.8 GW appearing in net-metering data. In Africa, official records show 23.4 GW operating, but Chinese export data suggests total capacity may exceed 63 GW . Most of this growth is residential and small-scale commercial, quietly transforming energy systems beyond the grid.
UK launches massive new plan to slash household energy bills. The UK government has unveiled a £15 billion plan to fund solar panels, heat pumps and home batteries over five years, aiming to cut bills, reduce gas dependence and lift one million people out of fuel poverty. The scheme combines grants and low-interest loans, expands heat-pump subsidies, and mandates solar and low-carbon heating in new homes. BBC 
Poland proves coal exit can coexist with rapid growth. Poland has cut coal’s share of electricity from 95% in 2000 to about 51% today, one of the fastest declines in Europe, while delivering exceptional economic growth. Over the same period, GDP per capita (PPP) rose 143%, far outpacing the EU average and Germany. Once seen as a climate laggard, Poland now matches much richer economies on income and is the fastest-growing economy in the OECD. Its trajectory shows that phasing out coal need not constrain prosperity. Pawel Czyżak 
EVs outsell petrol cars in the European Union for first time. Battery-electric vehicles overtook standard petrol cars in EU monthly sales for the first time in December 2025, with registrations rising 51% year-on-year as petrol fell 19%, according to European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. EVs reached 17.4% of total EU car sales in 2025, up from 13.6% in 2024. The shift reflects accelerating electrification across Europe’s biggest markets, even as policy debates continue over post-2035 emissions rules. Carbon Brief 
EU formally approves a phase‑out of Russian gas. EU governments have given final legal approval to end Russian gas imports, cutting off liquefied natural gas by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by late 2027, according to Reuters. The move makes Europe’s post-Ukraine energy break with Moscow binding law, despite opposition from Hungary and Slovakia. Russian gas once supplied over 40% of EU demand; by 2025 this had fallen to around 13%. Companies face heavy penalties for non-compliance. Reuters 
Science & Technology
21st century technologies need more rare earth elements - now artificial lightning could recover them from e-waste. Rare earth elements have been in the news a lot recently, mostly as a trade football, but industrialised countries already have them in abundance… in the form of e-waste. Now scientists at Rice University have started using what’s basically artificial lighting in the form of “flash joule heating” to recover those rare earth metals. IEEE Spectrum 
The same artificial lightning could also turn garbage into diamonds. The Rice University process has also been used to vaporise mixed trash — plastic, food waste, paper, tires — all of which contain a lot of carbon. Tightly controlling the flash joule heating lets chemists turn the trash into graphene and even diamonds, with the added bonus that the bound-up carbon doesn’t become carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Reset [ https://en.reset.org/urban-mining-researchers-find-way-to-vaporise-e-waste-down-to-its-precious-metals/ & https://www.snexplores.org/article/converting-trash-to-valuable-graphene-in-a-flash & https://news.rice.edu/news/2021/flashed-nanodiamonds-are-just-phase ] 
Lucas Eddy, a grad student on the Rice team, also discovered that Thomas Edison may have inadvertently used flash joule heating to create graphene inside some of his early lightbulbs. Eddy, in writing up the discovery, urged other materials science researchers to re-examine old technology, such as vacuum tubes, arc lamps, and early X-ray tubes. These also may have accidentally produced unusual materials or reactions that weren’t noticed at the time. Ars Technica 
Humans mastered the art of creating fire 400,000 years ago, almost 350,000 years earlier than previously known, according to a groundbreaking discovery in a field in Suffolk in the United Kingdom. Scorched earth and fire-cracked axes show early humans started using fire almost as soon as they moved into Northern Europe. The Guardian 
In another “world’s oldest,” we’ve found what we believe to be the world’s oldest stencil, a 67,800-year-old handprint. In a cave on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, an ancient graffiti artist pressed their hand against the wall, then blew or spat a mouthful of pigment around it so that when they pulled the hand away an outline was left behind. After the original stencil was made, the outlines of the fingers were narrowed and elongated to make the hand look more claw-like.
The painting was originally missed because it was obscured by a “more recent motif” — a cave painting a mere 40,000 or 50,000 years old. BBC 
South Korean scientists [ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-025-01548-5 via https://www.technologynetworks.com/cancer-research/news/vaccinating-boys-could-help-eliminate-cervical-cancer-407889 ] say we could eliminate cervical cancer entirely if we start vaccinating boys for HPV. While it’s tough for boys to get cervical cancer, they can still spread the virus: models suggest that vaccinating around 65% of boys, along with current coverage in girls, could eliminate cervical cancer as a public‑health problem within about 70 years, which would be pretty amazing. 
Phages are viruses that prey on bacteria; they are often used to treat antibiotic-resistant infections. Turns out sending phages to space makes them better at killing bacteria: this information comes courtesy of a University of Wisconsin-Madison experiment where phages were sent to the ISS, along with their prey of choice: E. coli. In space, infection cycles progress more slowly than they do on earth, because of microgravity, so the phages had to get better at grabbing nearby bacteria in order to survive. When the ISS phages were returned to Earth, they were way better at hunting down terrestrial E.coli, even killing typically resistant strains. “It was a serendipitous finding,” said lead study author Srivatsan Raman . “We were not expecting that the mutant phages that we identified on the ISS would kill pathogens on Earth.” Live Science 
Speaking of ISS experiments, we’ve also discovered that sporophytes from moss can survive in the vacuum of space. The sporophytes were affixed to the exterior of the ISS for over nine months; 80% survived, and 89% of the surviving population was able to germinate back in the lab. “This study demonstrates the astonishing resilience of life that originated on Earth,” said Tomomichi Fujita, the study’s author. In a future where we try terraforming other planets, resilient plants like moss could help with oxygen generation, humidity control or even soil formation… and could help us develop sustainable life-support systems.

And finally, nice work from the James Webb Space Telescope, which this week sent back new pictures of the Helix Nebula in phenomenal clarity. The space telescope’s website  has the photographs in all their glory, along with comparisons to photographs of Helix taken by older space telescopes like VISTA and Hubble. 
That’s a wrap! Thanks for making that donation possible. You all rock. Can’t wait to share updates from the Dogs4Wildlife team as the sanctuary progresses. 
Also, this was our first edition with the inimitable Betsy Isaacson at the helm for our science and technology section, let us know what you think :)
