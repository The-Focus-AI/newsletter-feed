The Middle East Forum has a comprehensive assessment  of US force movements, readiness, and escalation risks in the Persian Gulf. Here’s their timeline: 
January 5: Zero carriers in CENTCOM area of responsibility (source )—first time since October 2023.
January 9: CENTCOM announces “no change” to force composition (source ) despite Iranian protests.
January 12: New air defense coordination cell (MEAD-CDOC) opens at Al Udeid (source ).
January 13: USS George H.W. Bush departs Norfolk (source ); destination unknown.
January 14: Partial evacuation of Al Udeid ordered (source ); six KC-135s depart. Trump posts “help is on the way.”
January 15: USS Abraham Lincoln confirmed transiting west from the Philippines (source ).
January 16: Trump claims Iran “stopped killing protesters”—temporary pause, unverifiable.
January 18: First F-15Es arrive at Muwaffaq Salti, Jordan (source ); C-17 flights to Diego Garcia reported.
January 20: CENTCOM publicly acknowledges F-15E deployment (source ).
January 21: Second wave of 12 F-15Es departs UK; approximately 35 now in theater.
January 22: Twenty or more KC-135s at Al Udeid (source ); THAAD/Patriot deployments reported.
January 23-24: Trump describes “massive fleet” heading to Gulf (source ); airlines cancel Middle East flights.
January 25-26: USS Abraham Lincoln arrives in Gulf of Oman (source ).
January 27: US announces regional “aerial drills” across Middle East (source ).
Mid-January: CENTCOM reportedly ordered to 24/7 war-planning posture (source ) for “the next month.”
They conclude: 
The United States is assembling a multi-domain strike package capable of conducting sustained operations against Iran. The simultaneous deployment of carrier aviation, land-based fighters, tanker support, and missile defense systems indicates preparation for a major contingency rather than a limited, one-time strike. The posture suggests three possible uses: deterrence signaling intended to modify Iranian behavior without actual combat; preparation for strikes on IRGC and Basij forces conducting the crackdown on protesters; or groundwork for a broader campaign against Iranian military and nuclear infrastructure.
Several factors create uncertainty about American intentions and capabilities. The carrier gap that existed until now left a window of reduced capability. Much of the military force available was recently surged to the Caribbean for Venezuela operations. Host-nation permissions—particularly from Qatar and the Gulf states—remain a political constraint, as these governments fear Iranian retaliation. A former senior US military official told reporters that any major operation “would be massive” and “would dwarf anything we have likely done in the recent past.”
Israel’s position adds another layer of complexity. Israeli officials have reportedly requested that the United States delay any strikes until sufficient American forces are in place to help defend against Iranian retaliation. Israeli interceptor stockpiles were depleted in the June 2025 conflict, and Prime Minister Netanyahu has reportedly informed Washington that Israel is not currently prepared to defend against a major Iranian response. 
Iran, for its part, has threatened “total war” in response to any American strike and has warned regional hosts that their facilities will be targeted. Whether Iranian capabilities match this rhetoric is unclear, but the June 2025 experience demonstrated Iran’s willingness to strike American bases directly.
The buildup is real, substantial, and accelerating. Whether it culminates in military action or serves as coercive leverage for a diplomatic outcome remains in the hands of decision-makers in Washington, Tehran, and regional capitals. What is certain is that the United States is positioning itself to have options.
Trump, Reuters reports, is “weighing options” against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to “inspire” protesters. Two “US sources familiar with the discussions” said that Trump wants to “create conditions for regime change.” But Israeli and Arab officials are saying that air power won’t be enough to topple the regime .
According to CNN,  the US and Iran had been exchanging messages through Omani diplomats, and Steve Witkoff was talking to Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, earlier this month. But Iran categorically rejected Trumps demand that Iran agree to limit the range of its ballistic missiles. Iran said it would only discuss its nuclear program. That’s a non-starter. The ballistic missile program is as much a threat as the nuclear program, particularly (but definitely not only)  to Israel. 
New York Times:   
President Trump sharply intensified his threats against Iran, suggesting that if it did not agree to a set of demands the administration had made of the country’s leaders, he could soon mount an attack “with speed and violence.” Mr. Trump’s threat of a second direct attack on Iran by US forces in eight months came as the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln, along with other naval ships, bombers and fighter jets, took up positions in the region in striking distance of the country. 
Mr. Trump explicitly compared the buildup to the forces he amassed near Venezuela late last year, just ahead of the operation that seized Nicolás Maduro and his wife in the middle of the night early in January. Mr. Trump gave no specifics about the deal he was demanding, saying only that a “massive Armada” was heading toward Iran and that the country should make a deal. But US and European officials say that in talks, they have put three demands in front of the Iranians: a permanent end to all enrichment of uranium and disposal of its current stockpiles, limits on the range and number of their ballistic missiles, and an end to all support for proxy groups in the Middle East, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis operating in Yemen. 
Notably absent from those demands—and from Mr. Trump’s post on Truth Social on Wednesday morning—was any reference to protecting the protesters who took to the streets in Iran in December, convulsing the country and creating the latest crisis for its government. Mr. Trump had promised, in past social media posts, to come to their aid, but has barely mentioned them in recent weeks.
ALSO OF NOTE
Keir Starmer, in Beijing, announces visa-free travel to China for UK citizens.  See: 
Ahmet al-Sharaa is back in Moscow for the second time in two months: 
Moscow has been working to build relations with Ahmed al-Sharaa and ensure a continued military presence in the country, which serves to bolster its influence in the Middle East. The meeting comes after Russia withdrew its forces from the Qamishli airport in Kurdish-held northeast Syria earlier this week.
And the mental health of the President of the United States remains the best anyone has ever seen, maybe the best in history:
