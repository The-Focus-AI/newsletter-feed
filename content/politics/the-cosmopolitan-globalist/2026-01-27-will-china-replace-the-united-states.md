PART I
WHEN ALLIES DEFECT
Recently, the Canadian prime minister announced a new “strategic partnership” between Canada and China. After a four-day visit to Beijing, Mark Carney signed what he called a “landmark” deal with China to remove trade barriers, reduce tariffs, and to inaugurate a new Sino-Canadian relationship.
Relations between China and Canada had been chilly. In lockstep with Joe Biden, Justin Trudeau imposed a 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles. China retaliated by imposing massive tariffs on Canadian goods. In 2018, at the request of the United States, Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, daughter of the founder of Huawei, on charges of fraud aimed at circumventing sanctions on Iran. China retaliated by arresting two Canadian citizens.
Carney foreshadowed, in Beijing, the speech he would later give at Davos. Describing his trip as “historic” and “productive,” he told reporters:
 … it’s been eight years since a Canadian prime minister visited China. And in that time, the world has changed dramatically. The technological revolution and the energy transition are accelerating at an unprecedented pace. The global trading system is undergoing a fundamental change and the effectiveness of multilateral institutions on which trading powers such as Canada and China have greatly relied  has been greatly reduced. This is happening fast. It’s large. It’s a rupture. It’s not a transition.
He didn’t need to say why. Canada’s relationship with China, he said, had been “distant and uncertain” for nearly a decade:
That has held back investment. It’s stalled business growth and cost Canadian workers good opportunities. And it has had the consequence of leaving us even more dependent on our largest trading partner. And that’s why immediately after the election, Canada’s new government began to recalibrate our relationship with China—strategically, pragmatically, and decisively.
At the close of his visit, speaking in French and English—and more pointedly in French—he explained to journalists that the agreement had five pillars. The first was clean energy and “climate competitiveness.” Describing the Canadian and Chinese economies as “complementary,” he said that Canada was a conventional and clean energy superpower, whereas China “produces some of the most affordable and efficient energy-efficient vehicles in the world.” To build its own, competitive electric vehicle sector, he said, Canada must “learn from innovative partners, access their supply chains, and increase local demand.” Within five years, he predicted, more than half the vehicles on Canada’s roads will be “affordable EVs with an import price of less than C$35,000.”
Canada planned major investments in hydro, nuclear, solar, and wind power, he said, which would create “tremendous opportunities for Chinese partnerships in these investments, including in energy storage and offshore wind.” Meanwhile, Canada was developing its oil and natural gas reserves—one of the world’s largest—“to be the lowest risk, lowest cost, and lowest carbon.” 
The next pillar, said Carney, was food and agriculture. Before Canada joined the United States’ protectionist policy on electric vehicles, he said, China had been Canada’s largest market for canola seed. Now that China had agreed to lift its tariffs, “We want to not just return to those levels, but to surpass them.” Canada, he stressed meaningfully, “is a reliable partner.” 
In return, China agreed to lift tariffs on canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas. This meant C$3 billion in export orders for Canadian farmers, fish harvesters, and processors, who were now free to realize the “full potential of this market of 1.4 billion people.” The agreement would be the first step, he said, toward eliminating barriers to trade in other important agricultural products. Canada would welcome Chinese businesses “to significantly scale up their investment in Canada in major clean energy project as well as in agriculture and consumer projects.” This would create “the stability and certainty” required to “catalyze new investment and opportunities for Canadian workers.”
The third pillar was “multilateralism and strengthening global governance … when all of this is in flux.” China would host APEC this year, and “Canada stands ready to support their agenda, focused on strengthening and reinvigorating the multilateral system.” China would back Canada’s bid to host the 2029 APEC Leader Summit.
The fourth pillar was “public safety and security.” The countries’ law  enforcement agencies would increase their cooperation to combat narcotics trafficking, synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, transnational and cyber crime, and money laundering. The final pillar was “people-to-people ties” between Canada and China. China had granted approved-destination status for travelers to Canada, and would henceforth allow Canadians to come to China visa-free.
The new relationship, Carney said, marked the beginning of a “new world order.” The old one had been “eroded, to use a polite term. Or undercut.” Canada’s relationship with China had of late been “predictable.” His talks with Beijing had been “realistic and respectful.” When asked about China’s dismal human rights record, he replied, “We take the world as it is—not as we wish it to be.”
The new partnership goes far beyond rhetoric.  Because the deal entails considerable Chinese investments in Canada, there will now be a large Chinese presence on America’s doorstep. China will surely exploit its cooperation with Canadian law enforcement agencies in all the ways one would expect. 
Writing for Canada’s National Post, Terry Glavin excoriated the deal, accusing Carney of a “Trump-level indifference to tyranny .” China, he has written elsewhere,  “is a predator and détente should be out of the question.”
… While he was vice-chairman of Brookfield Asset Management, Prime Minister Mark Carney developed intimate ties at the most senior levels of the Chinese Communist Party, and his government’s approach is not simply to turn the page but to close the chapter on the reasons behind Canada’s post-2021 diplomatic estrangement from China altogether. The new Beijing-Ottawa “strategic partnership” appears to consist mostly of an agreement by the Canadian side to avoid entirely such “irritants” as Beijing’s brutal capture of Hong Kong, its vicious repressions in Xinjiang and Tibet, its vast strong-arming networks in Canada, its warmongering designs on Taiwan, its piracy in the South China Sea, and so on.
I’m of two minds about this. I have to think about it more. Terry’s case is a good one. But it’s immaterial whether I support or oppose the Sino-Canadian trade deal. It is happening, and so are many similar deals. What does this tell us about the future shape of the world? This is what Dan and I discussed in our podcast. Fans of Dan’s show notes can read them here.   
As is often the case, I had a few more thoughts after we finished. See below. I just noticed that like me, Dan was seized by l’esprit de l’escalier: He too has written an essay continuing his argument with me: 
I’m afraid Dan is wrong. There is every reason to believe that Trump has delivered the death blow to the American order. 
No country benefited more than Canada from an alliance with the United States, and no country was more culturally and economically absorbed into the American imperium. Canada’s proximity to the US ensured its security. It was enriched by reciprocal trade. It was woven into a defense arrangement so intimate that it bordered on joined sovereignty. 
The old order made alignment with the United States extremely attractive. Our allies tied their economies to ours to gain access to the world’s largest consumer market, but also to enjoy the security of protected sea lanes and trade routes, the steadiness of a dollar-based financial system, and the macroeconomic stability supplied by our independent central bank. On top of this, alignment with the US offered our allies security against regional predators—for most, this was the greatest attraction—even as it offered them dignity in these arrangements: They were not subordinates in a sphere of influence, or so the story went; they were equal and sovereign members of a rule-governed, liberal project.
The US ran an order based on rules rather than whims, enforced mostly against itself. This included the GATT and then the WTO; the Bretton Woods institutions; most-favored-nation trade rules, international arbitration, sovereign debt resolution regimes, and a host of critical institutions big and small, from the International Atomic Energy Agency to the International Postal Union. These institutions turned American power into something that others could plan around, which is why it was attractive rather than merely coercive.
American hegemony offered countless conveniences, too: the integration of global supply chains; dollar-based capital markets; systems such as SWIFT and the open standards on which the Internet is based; global protection of intellectual property. This was the less romantic aspect of hegemony, but often the stickiest—joining the hegemon meant joining its technical stack.
More, during the Cold War, the US was a civilizational magnet, with an extremely attractive political model involving mass democracy, the rule of law, and a Bill of Rights. Our eye-popping affluence was enjoyed by our massive middle class. We produced irresistible pop culture; we had the world’s best universities, we had a genius for absorbing immigrants and talent; and we were a happy, hardworking, and optimistic people. For elites in Europe and Asia, the US wasn’t just a market—it was a model of the future.
But when Washington began to use tariffs as a weapon; sanction its allies; coerce supply chains;, and abandon, bill, or threaten to invade its treaty partners, these incentives inverted. When a hegemon stops underwriting security and starts charging for it, ceases to obeying the rules it sets, no longer embodies an appealing model, and begins demanding tribute, the attraction collapses. The world’s best neighbor now looks unreliable at best; dangerous at worst. Beijing didn’t seduce Canada. We thrust Canada into Beijing’s arms, making it abundantly clear we could no longer be bothered—and did not even understand—the world we had built. 
Canada is hardly the only one. Allies suffering under our tariff regime have been briskly scheduling visits to Beijing. Macron made the pilgrimage in December, accompanied by a coterie French business executives, and returned with a nuclear energy cooperation agreement. South Korea’s president followed suit, signing more than a dozen agreements on technology, intellectual property, and consumer goods. Last week, when the Irish prime minister went visited, Xi told the Taoiseach that China and Ireland should work together to lead the world in artificial intelligence and the digital economy. Keir Starmer is Beijing-bound. So is Friedrich Merz. 
Our allies have concluded that unreliability is now a structural feature of American politics, not an aberration. Whether that assumption proves correct over decades is an open question. Perhaps, as Dan argues, we can reverse all of these ominous developments. But responsible leaders can’t predicate their strategies on hope. They have no choice but to hedge. 
Beijing sees the deal with Canada deal as evidence that even America’s closest allies can be peeled away and folded into a China-centric global trade architecture. But these deals matter less for what anyone thinks they mean than for what will be built. Plants, contracts, supply chains, and training pipelines will anchor this realignment in the physical world. Once that choice is made, it tends to be irreversible, because walking it back would mean voluntarily and deliberately returning to position of vulnerability. 
Power of the kind we’ve long enjoyed requires credibility, consistency, and restraint. Now that this has been so severely diluted, it won’t snap back into place just because we elect a new president (should we have the opportunity to do so). Trump can dominate a conversation for a news cycle, but he can’t dominate supply chains that have been rerouted to bypass his tantrums. 
Trump’s threats to Greenland destroyed any hope of the system returning to normal, as Dan hopes. 
Americans are eager to think this unhappy episode resolved, and seem to be viewing it as a moment of madness among all the others. The US media has already moved on, understandably distracted by the outrages in Minnesota. But our allies will never forget it.
The phenomenon of a hegemon threatening its allies is exceptionally rare. I can only think of a few historic examples. Athens’ cannibalization of the Delian League might be one; when this process reached its terminal stage in the Sicilian Expedition—a grand, delusional offensive war far outside the League’s original mandate—the result was bankruptcy. Persia reentered Sparta gained naval parity. Athens never recovered. 
The Romans were far too skillful to threaten their allies. Instead, they absorbed them through citizenship. They were imperial maximalists, but they were very careful about how they annexed things, converting allies into dependents, then clients, then provinces. At each stage they made the subordinate polity ask Rome for what Rome already intended to take. 
With the weakening of the Austrian Empire, Vienna tried repeatedly to reassert direct control over its constituent nations, even by inviting the Tsar to put down the Hungarian revolution in 1848. Hungary, Bohemia, Transylvania, and the Italian possessions weren’t quite “allies” in the modern sense, but they functioned similarly in the imperial constitutional framework; they were integral but privileged peripheries. The re-annexation of Hungary after the revolution is instructive. The monarchy was desperate, financially exhausted, and dependent on Russian intervention. The annexation succeeded, militarily, but destroyed the cohesion of the empire and accelerated the national question that undid it entirely in 1918. 
The late Ottoman Empire also shifted from a strategy of managing its vassals to reabsorbing them, especially under Abdul Hamid II. Here, too, the change was driven by imperial desperation, motivated by manpower shortages, fear of European encroachment, and the prospect of revenue extraction. The result was catastrophic; it accelerated the Empire’s fragmentation and collapse.
The case of the USSR is not quite parallel, but there are similarities. Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland began as cooperative satellite allies; over time Moscow transitioned from managing clients to occupying them (Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia 1968). This wasn’t annexation, but it was sociologically similar—the hegemon lost confidence in its alliance architecture and began cannibalizing the metropole. When Gorbachev reversed this logic under the Sinatra Doctrine, the system collapsed instantly, revealing the pathology of this strategy. 
There’s an interesting near-miss in De Gaulle’s 1961 Fouchet Plan, which aimed, in effect, to convert the emerging supranational European Community into a French-led protectorate system, subordinating German foreign and defense policy to Paris. This example is less territorial, more institutional, but analytically closer, perhaps, to current US behavior, in which a hegemon attempts to re-engineer an alliance originally designed to benefit all of its members into one that allows the hegemon to extract advantages that other members can’t. If France had succeeded—and it nearly did—it would have amounted to the hegemon internalizing its own allied order. But it failed, and the failure revealed that French hegemony was already exhausted. Bonn refused and pivoted toward the Atlantic architecture. 
The phenomenon is rare for a reason. A hegemon typically wants allies as buffers, multipliers of force and legitimacy, and to outsource the costs of maintaining hegemony. To annex an ally is to obviate those functions. Hegemons only do this, it seems, when they’re under great pressure to extract short-term value to sustain themselves. This marks it as a terminal strategy—one that appears in the final chapters of empires, when the patron begins to conceive of its allies as assets to be liquidated. By the time it occurs, the order in question is already in its death throes; the event merely reveals the condition to those who remained in denial.
Trump’s demand violated a law so fundamental to the Western alliance system that no one ever bothered to put it in writing. That intra-alliance predation was prohibited went without saying. NATO survived not because the United States possessed overwhelming power, but because it didn’t use that power against its own. 
The taboo has now been broken, and this can’t be undone. The effect is all the more pronounced because it wasn’t an isolated incident. In the podcast and in the article he wrote afterward, Dan argues that Americans didn’t vote for Trump because they wanted to acquire Greenland; indeed, the idea of invading Greenland is wildly unpopular. This means, in his view, that it’s premature for our allies to conclude that the US has become an unregenerate imperial predator:
… He ran primarily on “wokeness,” grievance about his fantasy that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and retribution against his many enemies. He ran against a Democratic candidate who had not won a single primary in 2020 or 2024, who emerged through party paralysis rather than popular enthusiasm, who was burdened by the perception—fair or not—of having helped conceal Joe Biden’s incapacity, and who faced the enduring realities of sexism and racism in American politics. Trump won not by ten points, but by 1.5 percent, with under 50 percent of the vote. And a year into his presidency, he is less popular than any modern president at the same point in office.
This is not a some referendum in which Americans decided to trash the world order but a series of terrible accidents, mistakes, and misunderstandings.
But this isn’t so. It was clear from Trump’s first utterances on the 2016 campaign trail   that he viewed our allies as assets to be strip-mined, abandoned, or subordinated for our gain. Over and over, and in no uncertain terms, Trump made it clear that he holds our allies in contempt, cannot see the point of them, believes we’re being “ripped off” by them, and wishes for us to be unburdened from them.  He long ago declared NATO obsolete. His views have been crystal clear since 1987, when he returned from a trip to Moscow and took out a full-page ad   denouncing our allies as parasites. 
It’s true, as Dan argues, that only a vanishingly small number of Americans would say, “I voted for Trump because I want us to invade our neighbors, steal their natural resources, shake down our allies, and sell them out to Moscow.” But any American who professes astonishment that this is precisely what Trump has done is either lying or incapable of understanding plain English. Trump could not have made his intention to do all of this more clear . 
What our allies saw, and were right to see, is that most Americans just didn’t care. He did openly campaign on “discarding NATO, abandoning Ukraine, aligning with autocrats, and burning down the global order the United States built and led for eight decades.” And we elected him—twice. 
Our allies have also seen—and they have been right to see—that while Trump’s rhetoric and actions are vastly more crude, he represents a bipartisan trend of imperial absent-mindedness, verging on amnesia, layered atop a bipartisan trend toward growing incompetence  in foreign policy that dates from the end of the Cold War. It has been generations since Americans evinced a widespread understand the global order that underpins their prosperity and security. We have meanwhile chosen one president after another who is visibly unqualified to be a responsible steward of this order. It has even become a truism of American politics that foreign policy doesn’t matter a whit to the electorate. This is why the order has been shifting in ways that antedate Trump and are likely to endure when he’s gone. 
Consider, for example, the Persian Gulf. For decades, the United States guaranteed its security, suppressing interstate war and ensuring the uninterrupted flow of oil. In return, Gulf monarchies priced that oil in dollars and recycled their surplus earnings into US financial markets. The result was a global energy system denominated in dollars, and a wall of foreign capital that financed American deficits at low interest rates. This highly advantageous petro-financial compact underwrote America’s geopolitical primacy abroad and its economic buoyancy at home. Few arrangements in modern history have delivered so much power so discreetly. 
American incoherence has unraveled this architecture. This began before Trump’s presidency, though he has certainly accelerated it. For years now, Washington has made it plain that it wants a regional balance of power without American troops. It wants sanctions on Iran—and the liberty to bomb it now and again—but it doesn’t want to protect Saudi Arabia from the fallout. The Saudis have come to view the United States as a feckless power that destabilized the region, and empowered Iran, with its war in Iraq, its failure to intervene in Syria, and its support for Mubarak’s ouster. 
Nothing shocked the Gulf so much as the American response, or lack of response, to Saudi Arabia’s Pearl Harbor—the 2019 attack on Aramco.  Washington barely processed it; Riyadh processed it instantly. 
Atriking the Abqaiq and Khurais processing facilities, Iran’s cruise missiles and drones took five percent of global oil supply off the market. This was the nightmare scenario that had long justified the American security umbrella. The attack revealed that the United States was no longer willing to perform its core function as a hegemon. Washington did nothing in response, still less something resembling a proper hegemonic response. We repositioned no carrier groups, carried out no retaliatory strikes, conducted no punitive diplomacy, offered no reaffirmation of our security guarantees. Instead—having explicitly run on a platform of making Saudi Arabia pay for its protection —Trump announced that the US was now “energy independent” (we were not) and therefore needn’t worry about this. 
From Riyadh’s vantage, this was an enlightenment. Everyone in the Gulf, in fact, understood immediately that their security guarantees were now optional, negotiable, and perhaps already gone. For the Saudis, the Qataris, and the Emiratis, this required a wholesale reappraisal of the assumptions that organized their worlds. This is why we observed all of the following within 24 months: a Gulf–China rapprochement; a Gulf–Iran détente; the Gulf states’ acquisition of ballistic, drone, and electronic warfare systems from China; the acceleration of the Gulf’s indigenous defense industries; exploratory talks on yuan oil settlements; Gulf sovereign wealth diversification away from Treasuries; and Riyadh’s refusal to take US instructions on oil output. Every one of these can be traced to September 2019.
Before 2019, Saudi Arabia was effectively part of the US imperial circuit: oil surpluses priced in dollars became US assets, financing US military primacy, which in turn secured the Gulf.  After 2019, the Saudis asked the correct question: What if the hegemon no longer wants the circuit? Once that question enters the bloodstream, the order is already dying. The rest is just the consequences of that insight. The Gulf realized the United States no longer saw the defense of the energy system as its job. After that, no amount of arms sales could restore the order. 
During the Cold War, we purchased Saudi Arabia moderation in OPEC with arms transfers and security guarantees. The Saudis didn’t follow our lead on oil pricing out of their love for truth, justice, and the American way. Trump wasn’t an aberration. Biden then ran on a promise to make the Kingdom a pariah, until he found himself confronting exactly the that had caused Roosevelt to enter the unwritten contract with the Kingdom in the first place, in 1945: Russian aggression. The Saudis, by this point, were much less accommodating than they would once have been—less because they were offended by his remarks than because they now had other options. 
The Gulf has been increasingly autonomous in oil pricing since then. Contracts are no longer exclusively dollar-denominated. Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate have lost their exclusivity as oil benchmarks. The giant Gulf investment funds have moved from US Treasuries to global equities, infrastructure, and Asian instruments. The share of dollars held in reserve in GCC central banks is declining. 
The UAE has pulled back on US defense purchases while expanding Chinese tech imports. US–Saudi security guarantees are now negotiated openly, not assumed. The US has reduced its Gulf footprint even as the Houthis continue to attack shipping. CENTCOM operations are reactive, not order-enforcing, and they’re not predictable. The US hasn’t been able to make good on Trump’s threats to Iran because its aircraft carriers have been in the Caribbean. So Gulf states are developing their own security diplomacy—because they must. 
China gives the Gulf predictability and infrastructure. It’s not a military substitute, but it offers a more subtle package, one that’s often, from the Saudi perspective, more immediately useful. It was Beijing that brokered the normalization of relations between Riyadh and Tehran—and now that Iran’s nuclear program is no longer an immediate threat, Riyadh appears to have no need for a peace deal with Israel.
The old regime assumed automatic dollar recycling, which suppressed US borrowing costs. The new regime assumes portfolio maximization, which raises them. This won’t bring the dollar’s reign to an end immediately, but it means the Gulf has bargaining freedom, and by definition, bargaining freedom is the opposite of hegemony. 
The hallmark of Narcissistic Personality Disorder is the inability to appreciate that other people are not mere extensions of oneself—they are separate beings, with legitimate desires and needs of their own. So it’s unsurprising that Donald Trump can’t grasp that other countries, too, have interests and politics of their own. But US foreign policy acquired a distinctly narcissistic hue even before Trump’s rise. 
Take India. India should, naturally, be our ally, and could have been, had we been more attuned to its needs. India doesn’t want to live in a world dominated by China, nor in a world that’s been abandoned by the United States. In this, it is historically consistent. 
Washington assumed that a shared fear of Beijing would compel India’s obedience, forgetting that India’s strategic culture has despised subordination for far longer than the United States has existed. The US demanded alignment against both Russia and China without offering India access to its markets, a technological partnership, or a predictable policy on sanctions. India responded with the equanimity of a civilization accustomed to imperial requests: It bought discounted Russian oil, expanded its cooperation with BRICS, and invested in naval and aerospace capabilities suitable to a world in which no hegemon would be benign. The United States childishly interpreted this as perfidy. 
India’s calculation didn’t require anti-Americanism, just a sober reading of American domestic chaos. It saw in the US a polity incapable of sustaining strategy beyond a single presidency, a Congress that treats foreign policy as campaign fodder, and a bureaucracy demoralized by ideological whiplash. Nonalignment, for India, is a risk-management algorithm. If the United States wanted India to be a pillar of its system, it should have behaved as a system worth joining. 
Similarly, Southeast Asia never truly chose China: It just stopped waiting for America to return. For a generation, ASEAN officials listened politely as Washington delivered lectures about democracy, the rules-based order, maritime security, and the importance of alliance networks. These were fine words. But they weren’t signed trade agreements. When Washington withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership , it conveyed what Beijing had never managed to communicate through threat or inducement, namely, that the United States no longer cared whether it anchored the region’s economic architecture. China filled the vacuum with the dull efficiency of an imperial accountant, building ports, railways, digital infrastructure, and supply chains. It standardized payments, harmonized customs procedures, and offered something Southeast Asian governments prized above ideology—it was there.
The United States, having convinced itself that aircraft carrier visits constituted a strategy, never understood how deeply commerce had replaced conviction as the language of regional alignment. It’s not quite right to say that ASEAN is lost to China. The region hasn’t defected—it’s hedged. But hedging is a behavior specific to those who no longer expect the hegemon to show up. 
Much the same happened in Latin America. The exit from the American orbit transpired without fanfare or ideological revolt. There were no grand declarations. There was just the integration of Chinese telecoms, Brazilian soybean deals, Russian security advisers, and Iranian ministers, who toured the region with diplomatic smiles and commercial contracts. By the time Washington noticed, it was unclear whether it was alarmed by the loss of influence or embarrassed that it had failed to notice. 
For decades, the United States governed the hemisphere with a mixture of coercion, when it feared communist contagion; convenience, when cheap labor and compliant governments suited the balance sheets of its multinationals; and neglect, when the region failed to register in Washington’s electoral imagination. China didn’t really displace the United States; the United States wasn’t actually there in the first place. China offered what Washington didn’t: infrastructure, capital, and attention. 
The American order relied on the dollar because it was useful. Contracts were written in dollars; commodities were priced in dollars; sovereign reserves were stored in dollars. These arrangements involved an implicit bargain: The United States wouldn’t use its currency as a weapon against those who used it.
Washington broke this bargain with the exuberance of a country that can’t truly conceive of a world in which its power is questioned. It began doing so before Trump came on the scene, and continued doing so during the four years he was out of office. It sanctioned allies, enemies, neutrals, companies, banks. The world updated its risk models. What guarantee did Brazil, Indonesia, or South Africa have that their savings were secure? BRICS expanded. New Development Banks proliferated. Currency swap agreements multiplied. Other countries began experimenting with the non-dollar settlement of deals for energy and commodities. 
None of this has dethroned the United States. Dan is right; the dollar still dominates. But it’s achieved something subtler—it made the dollar optional. Once the dollar is optional, the order it underwrites is mortal.
Sometimes, the most catastrophic defeats in international politics aren’t military—they’re infrastructural. The US discovered this when it allowed China to build the world’s telecom networks, payments systems, and electric vehicle supply chains. No one adopted Huawei, Alipay, BeiDou, or CATL because they loved the CCP. They did it because these systems were cheap, functional, and available.
For nearly a century, American hegemony has been  expressed through standards: TCP/IP, GPS, Visa, Boeing, Ford, Qualcomm, Hollywood. Standards are the difference between a world that speaks your language and one that tolerates your existence. Standards determine what plugs into what, who gets to collect the rent, and whose laws govern the disputes.
When Washington tried to block Chinese firms without replacing them, it committed another error that could only be made by a power that believes it dominates the globe because this is the natural order of things. Observing that Americans were too consumed by congressional WWE to invest in 5G or battery factories, China went ahead and built the future while Washington made speeches about it. A world that uses Chinese protocols will be tempted to adopt Chinese politics—less because it admires them than because there’s no other venue in which to contest them.
By the late 2010s, the world had begun to understand that American foreign policy could no longer be disentangled from its domestic psychodrama. Treaties, alliances, and trade agreements were no longer covenants, they were props—thrown, brandished, or discarded depending which faction of the American electorate was screaming loudest that week.
When Trump pulled out of the TPP, he offered no intelligible argument for doing so—nor did he offer a better solution. When he scrapped the Iran nuclear deal, he offered no intelligible argument for doing so—nor did he offer a better solution. When he left the Paris climate accords, he again offered no intelligible argument for doing so—nor did he offer a better solution. He plainly disliked all of these agreements because Obama had negotiated them. His aim was to please a television audience, not build a better order. He insulted NATO not because it had failed, but because it existed. Meanwhile, he demanded an increase defense spending from allies even as it made clear that the purpose of this spending wasn’t to reinforce a shared strategy, but to subsidize our defense contractors.  Europeans were forced to accept that NATO had become less an alliance than a protection racket and a hostage situation. What would have been unthinkable a decade ago—a Europe preparing for war without the United States—is now a reality. 
Our allies don’t fear our decline; they fear our elections. A country whose global role depended on the world’s perception of its competence and continuity now presents itself, every four years, as a psychiatric experiment conducted at planetary scale. Its presidential pronouncements are indistinguishable from hallucinations. The US won’t lose the world because it’s weak, militarily. It will lose it because it’s too insane for anyone sane to tolerate.
PART II
WHEN EMPIRES FALL
… It’s hard to say who wanted it to happen,
But now it’s been decided nobody minds.
The places are a long way off, not here,
Which is all right, and from what we hear
The soldiers there only made trouble happen.
Next year we shall be easier in our minds.
—Philip Larkin
The world is strewn with the wreckage of empires that once imagined themselves eternal. Many Americans believe they’re living through an unprecedented moment. In some ways, it is. But imperial decline is hardly our invention. The only novelty is the speed with which the United States has contrived to dissolve the architecture that made its power appear inevitable.
Decline does not, typically, involve collapse. As a rule, hegemons don’t fall because at last, their enemies have defeated them. They fall because their friends have concluded that continued loyalty is a bad bet. Once the allies defect, the system is finished. The hegemon persists as a country, sometimes even a strong one, but it’s no longer the axis around which the world revolves. It becomes what Britain became after 1956 and what Spain became after 1898—a nostalgic nation-state. The world has seen this many times. But Americans are now, for the first time, living inside it, rather than watching it on a documentary.
The Byzantine Empire died three times, but the death that matters isn’t its death at the hands of the Turks. It’s its death at the hands of its allies. The sack of Constantinople in 1204 wasn’t the result of military inferiority, but the consequence of systemic misalignment. Venice decided that Byzantium was no longer the indispensable broker of Mediterranean commerce, and once it did, the empire’s putative friends calculated that more could be gained by despoiling it than defending it.
The Byzantines believed, until the Venetian fleet appeared at their sea walls, that their diplomatic history would protect them. They paid allies, married them, mediated their disputes, and served as the center of an entire civilizational sphere. But when the balance sheet shifted, its allies became predators. No enemy could have breached the city without their cooperation.
Americans have long imagined that alliances are built on sentiment: shared values, shared histories, shared blood. Yes, these do matter. But the cold arithmetic of advantage matters more. Venice didn’t turn on Constantinople because it disliked Greek Orthodoxy. It turned because the network of trade, finance, and protection that Byzantium had controlled could now be replicated elsewhere. When Canadian, French, South Korean, and Irish ministers travel to Beijing for commercial compacts instead of to Washington for political reassurance, the sound you hear is the creak of the Venetian oars—the sound an empire makes when its network of tributaries no longer offers the shortest path to prosperity. The sack comes later. The pivot comes first.
The Dutch Republic in the 18th century offers the purest economic analogue for the contemporary United States. There’s a moment when Britain superseded the Dutch. At that moment, Amsterdam still cleared Europe’s debts, and its merchants still dominated transport insurance. Its financiers still determined the price of capital. The money center remained Dutch long after Europe had stopped asking Dutch diplomats for their opinions.
Amsterdam’s decline was delayed not by its military strength but by financial inertia. Currencies don’t lose reserve status because suddenly, the world dislikes the issuing power. They lose it when alternative venues exist and the network benefits begin to erode. This was the case when the Dutch guilder ceased to be the unquestioned numéraire of European commerce. It didn’t collapse. It faded, gently, as Britain built the global trading, naval, and industrial architecture that made sterling and London the new clearing center.
The US is now in precisely this phase. The dollar continues to dominate settlement and reserves, and it will for some time. But the existence of credible alternatives—yuan swaps, BRICS infrastructure banks, sovereign reserves diversified into commodities—means that the dollar’s reserve role has become a choice, not a destiny. 
As the Dutch discovered, having financial clout but no strategic power means you’re waiting to be replaced. The US will discover this too when it realizes that dollar dominance can coexist with geopolitical irrelevance. Clearing trade in US currency will no longer guarantee American influence over the nations doing the clearing.
Spain entered the nineteenth century as a power in denial. Its empire had been hollowed out by debt, insurgency, industrial backwardness, and Britain’s naval dominance of the global commons. Yet Spain retained a fiction of imperial status, reinforced occasionally by court ceremony and diplomatic pleasantries. This survived until 1898, when the United States destroyed what remained of Spain’s fleet in a war so brief and humiliating that even Americans were shocked.
The Spanish disaster matters not for its military dimension, which was foreordained, but for what it signaled: the symbolic confirmation that the empire was finished. Madrid’s illusions couldn’t withstand the spectacle of its last colonies slipping away. The world stopped treating Spain as anything but a modest European power, and Spain, at last, was forced to think of itself in the same terms.
We haven’t yet had our 1898 moment. But we’ve sowed the conditions for it. A country that threatens to annex allied territory, withdraws from key global bodies without proposing credible substitutes—we withdrew from 66 more of them  last week—disdains its own treaty commitments, transforms global finance into a weapon without consultation, and relocates its aircraft carriers to provide domestic political spectacles just can’t expect the world to keep pretending that it is the sane and indispensable arbiter of global order. When the symbolic crack comes—whether in the Arctic, the Middle East, or the Taiwan Strait—it won’t be the moment of decline. It will just be the moment we stop using euphemisms to describe it.
Interwar France, as Simon Pearce recently reminded us,   wasn’t defeated in 1940 because it lacked soldiers, tanks, or industrial capacity. It was defeated because it had become incapable of sustaining a strategic consensus at home. French politics in the late 1930s consisted of a culture war superimposed on a fiscal crisis superimposed on an ideological panic. The French viewed every foreign policy choice through the lens of domestic politics, and every minister believed himself to be governing on borrowed legitimacy. Alliances were mismanaged, rearmament was delayed, and the public lost the capacity to distinguish national strategy from partisan hysteria.
France’s allies watched with mounting despair. London and Moscow alike concluded that Paris could no longer be relied upon to behave rationally. The alliance network that might have deterred Germany dissolved not because the allies hated each other, but because they no longer trusted one another.
The United States has entered its own interwar phase of domestic derangement. Treaties, sanctions, and military deployments are now provisional statements of factional mood, subject to reversal every four years. Foreign ministers have stopped asking, “What does Washington want?” They ask, “Which Washington is speaking, and for how long?” This is the end state of a system where domestic hysteria has displaced strategy. 
Britain emerged victorious from the Second World War and was nonetheless finished as a global hegemon. Victory masked exhaustion. The empire could not afford its navy, could not afford its army, could not afford the bases, and could not afford the currency peg. The dollar gap hollowed the sterling area. The Americans imposed lender-of-last-resort conditions that effectively transferred the architecture of the global economy from London to Washington. Suez in 1956 made explicit what had been settled a decade before.
What’s most remarkable about Britain’s eclipse is how quietly it occurred. There was no catastrophe, no sack, no coup. The baton was passed in the polite language of Bretton Woods, IMF quotas, and agreements on base-sharing. The world order changed because the world concluded that Britain no longer had the capacity to run it. Having arrived at this conclusion, the markets, banks, and diplomats rearranged themselves accordingly.
If Britain could no longer afford to lead, the United States can no longer be bothered to lead. It has discovered that leadership is tedious and allies are demanding. Multilateral institutions require stamina, and maintaining systemic coherence requires a discipline that domestic politics no longer rewards. 
China, meanwhile, has discovered that leadership is profitable, allies are pliable, infrastructure buys loyalty, and multilateral institutions are ripe for acquisition. No one seized the baton. We left it by the side of the road, assuming we could always pick it back up again. Someone else picked it up.
The Soviet Union’s collapse is particularly instructive. The United States bears little resemblance to the USSR ideologically, but the mechanism of collapse is the same. The disintegration of the Soviet Union didn’t happen because Moscow itself was overthrown, but because the periphery defected, and Moscow was too exhausted to protest. The Baltic states left. Then the Caucasus. Then Central Asia. By the time the Russian Federation declared itself, the Soviet center had been deserted—not defeated, deserted.
The Soviet case reveals something like a law of hegemonic systems: The center never falls first. It’s always the allies, dependents, and clients who decide when the game is over. When they conclude that the system no longer rewards loyalty, they exit. When they exit, the system is no longer a system. 
Hegemons rarely recognize their own funerals. The British didn’t. The Spaniards certainly didn’t. The Byzantines convinced themselves they would be rescued by cousins with fleets that never arrived. France, in 1940, thought history was playing a practical joke. The Soviets imagined they could reform the system and thus retain it—and Vladimir Putin still hasn’t understood it is gone.
Americans, too, believe that their world order can be snapped back into place with an election, a speech, or a carrier strike group. They imagine that allies who have built supply chains with Beijing, rearmament plans without Washington, currency swaps with Shanghai, and multilateral institutions without the dollar will undo these arrangements out of sentiment. But sentiment is not how eras end. They end when rational actors decide that the benefits of loyalty no longer outweigh the risks. 
But we speak English, Dan says. And the world uses English as its lingua franca. Come on, now. As the persistence of the phrase lingua franca suggests, people learn to speak the hegemon’s language because it’s the hegemon. Language follows power, not vice-versa. 
PART III
THE AFTERMATH
When the world learns how to conduct its affairs without asking the empire’s permission, the empire collapses. For the United States, this process is now underway. It has been discreet, incremental, and often bureaucratic. If there has been no cinematic moment that confirms the transformation, that’s because generally, that’s not how the world works. 
What Americans will notice first—though they won’t, perhaps, have the vocabulary to name it—is the way the world will cease treating the United States as the default customer, and begin treating it as one customer among many. During the American century, the US occupied an unchallenged position at the front of every queue. Container ships were built for American ports, not the other way around. Pharmaceutical precursors arrived in the US first. Semiconductor fabrication plants were sited in states eager to offer tax abatements and infrastructure, not in countries that demanded intellectual property transfers and political obedience. The hegemon’s privilege was not just that it could project power, but that it could depend on the world to organize itself around its needs. That is ending. We will discover the change in the most prosaic places imaginable.
An American aerospace manufacturer will wait fourteen weeks for an input that Japanese firms receive in eight days. A procurement officer at a major hospital chain will discover that ventilator components have been routed to Seoul and Singapore first. A data center executive in Northern Virginia will find that all the H100s have been allocated to clients in Dubai, Shenzhen, and Bangalore: Americans have to wait for the next production cycle. 
A second realization will soon follow. We’ll discover that the world is no longer built to accommodate our legal preferences. For decades, to be American was to enjoy the privilege of extraterritoriality. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act traveled with American businessmen. Treasury regulations governed offshore banks. Export controls dictated the behavior of Asian foundries, European chip designers, and Middle Eastern logistics firms. A soft clerisy of American-trained lawyers ensured that the global system harmonized with Washington’s sensibilities. Even when Americans abused this privilege, foreign companies complied, because it was easier than resisting.
That era is drawing to a close. Compliance will no longer be the world’s default. A merger between two European firms will proceed without US antitrust review, because Europeans won’t bother to seek it. Singaporean banks will delist US clients because they don’t want to be entangled with the Internal Revenue Service. India’s parliament will decline our request for data localization exemptions. The WTO will rule against an American tariff regime, and Europeans will enforce the ruling without waiting to see whether we appeal. Slowly, we will come to appreciate that unilateral American legalism was not a structure of nature. 
The next phase will be financial. Unless Trump invades Greenland or does something equally insane—which, clearly, can’t be ruled out—the dollar will remain a dominant instrument of settlement for years, perhaps decades. But the privileges associated with issuing it will wither. We will find that our Treasury yields have gone up, because the world will stop believing that Treasury bonds are the safest asset available. Foreign investors will expect higher returns because the supply of alternative safe havens has grown. Borrowing at scale will no longer be costless, and fiscal discipline will no longer be a recommendation: It will be a condition.
Assume, arguendo, that we’re spared an immediate descent into global war. For American consumers, the economy will still function for years to come. The supermarkets will not be empty and the lights, probably, will not go out.  But the implicit subsidy that has masked the cost of American consumption for seventy years will evaporate. The country that once imported disinflation from its trade partners will begin importing inflation. Americans won’t just experience decline in the abstract—they’ll feel it at every checkout counter.  
The next and more painful phase involves talent. For more than a century, the United States has enjoyed the fruits of imperial brain drain. The world’s most ambitious scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and scholars chose American institutions  because this was where talent best flourished. The laboratories worked. The immigration system, if capricious, yielded to persistence. The funding flowed. The visas cleared. Our universities flourished and conferred prestige.
This pattern will reverse. It’s already well underway. The Chinese and Indian diasporas have begun to repatriate because the best opportunities are now to be found in the Pacific . Europe’s research ecosystem, long starved of oxygen by the American vacuum, will recover. The Gulf, because it is rich and focused, will continue its transformation from rentier client to technological patron. American talent will no longer be bound, as if by gravity, to its shores.
The next and most humiliating phase will involve status. Americans will come to understand, painfully, that the world has ceased to admire them. Admiration is a toxic nutrient; once you’ve metabolized it, withdrawal is agonizing. The American century produced a global culture of deference that saturated every interaction: English as lingua franca, American media as narrative substrate, the American passport as golden document. This is ending. It will be noticed in lines at the airport, university admissions, regulatory negotiations. 
NATO exercises will proceed without US participation in a rehearsal for a world in which American ships are deployed elsewhere. A Treasury attaché in Brussels will find that sanctions require European consent to be enforced. That consent will no longer be automatic. 
Only after these recognitions have accumulated will Americans begin to notice the most important transformation of all: Their politics will no longer be global, but provincial. 
Post-hegemonic societies turn inward. The British became melancholy. The French became self-absorbed. The Russians became even more paranoid.  Americans will turn inward through litigation, conspiracy theories, real conspiracies, and constitutional melodrama. A nation that can’t impose its will externally will try to impose it internally. We will search for traitors, saboteurs, cultural degenerates, and ideological infiltrators—we’ll follow the South’s path after 1865, when a society that could no longer command the continent turned to myth and grievance. 
The world won’t reject the United States, precisely: It will just stop caring. Unnerved by the loss of our centrality to the global narrative, we will interpret this indifference as an insult.
No foreign power will need to invade the United States. It will only need to exclude it from the venues where the future is decided—standards boards, payment systems, rare earths corridors, energy transition agreements, semiconductor alliances, talent networks, security compacts. We will still be invited to conferences, but increasingly, it will be in the way an aging uncle is invited to Thanksgiving dinner: out of politeness, not necessity.
Americans have no cognitive schema for being normal. After the end of the American century, we’ll confront the many ways our identity was built on the assumption of our primacy. What are we, when we are no longer a superpower? What are we, when we’re just another violent, badly-governed country in the Americas? 
There may be no Suez moment, no Versailles, no Battle of Vienna, no storming of the Winter Palace. There may be no cinematic ending at all. The world won’t cheer and it won’t jeer. It will just go on. Without us. 
We will be just one of the many screwed-up countries in the new world, with lots of drugs and lots of crime and a rather brutal authoritarian government. Few will visit. Why would they? We make it too hard for them to get visas, and our architecture isn’t that interesting. 
That said, our former rivals will have bitter memories and a permanent interest in keeping us down. We can expect Russia, China, and—depending how things go—other rising powers to continue meddling in our internal politics. 
This is the optimistic scenario. This is the scenario where we don’t slide right off the cliff into global war or a similar existential catastrophe. As for those existential catastrophes , we will experience what the rest of the world has long experienced: We will lack the power to prevent other countries from doing things that might endanger the entire human race. If ever we decide that yes, climate change is a threat to our lives and livelihoods, we won’t be the ones to lead the coalition to curb greenhouse gas emissions or undertake geoengineering experiments. If at last we decide it would be wise for the nations of the world to stop creating dangerous new pathogens, we’ll just have to hope that China agrees and does something about it. Like other countries, we will have to learn to accept that our destiny is not in our hands. 
Is China poised to take our place? On the podcast, we discussed why it might be, and why it might not be. But nature abhors a vacuum. A multipolar world order is so inherently unstable that sooner or later, either China will take our place, or there will be a global war. If any country survives that, it will be the world’s new hegemon. 
Historians will puzzle over this story—and the way we gave up so much, so fast for so little cause—for a very long time. They will think it very strange.
… Caesar’s double-bed is warm
As an unimportant clerk
Writes I DO NOT LIKE MY WORK
On a pink official form.
Unendowed with wealth or pity,
Little birds with scarlet legs,
Sitting on their speckled eggs,
Eye each flu-infected city.
Altogether elsewhere, vast
Herds of reindeer move across
Miles and miles of golden moss,
Silently and very fast.
—W.H. Auden
