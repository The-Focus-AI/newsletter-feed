By Andrew Chakhoyan
Three scholars walk into a bar and watch a country being invaded, live on TV. The constructivist says: “We must help.” The pragmatist says: “We should calculate costs and benefits.” The realist says: “Actually, this is NATO’s fault.”
It’s a joke, except that it isn’t. Every time Russia wages war, a familiar chorus rushes in to explain why the aggressor is not truly to blame, and why even mass atrocities must be “understood” rather than condemned. Responsibility is diluted, tired tropes and equivocation recited, and restraint is demanded not of the attacker, but of the victim. Don’t they know that appeasement is a path to a larger war, not a way to prevent it?
Armed with historical amnesia, Putinverstehers alike are keen to teach the masses that the safest path is to pressure the invaded country to accept occupation “for peace” and why, for the sake of “global stability,” it’s okay for Ichkerians, Georgians, and Ukrainians to have less freedom, less territory, and less dignity.
In Ukraine’s case, this advocacy implies that the world has no choice but to accept that Russia will, or even has the right to,  murder Ukrainian children  in the middle of the night and steal them. It’s Russia’s “sphere of influence.” Don’t you get it?
As an academic framing, Realpolitik in foreign policy is not the problem. It envisions states as self-interested actors competing for power and security in an international system. There is no global policeman, and even if America played one for a few decades, it was never a good idea.
Traditional realism emphasizes national interest, balances of power, and hard constraints over wishful thinking. It’s a helpful counterweight to the naive idealism of those who believe strongly-worded declarations can substitute for deterrence (see the  Budapest Memorandum ), and to neoconservative hubris (see: the Iraq war). Realism, properly applied, demands we perceive the world as it is, rather than as we’d like it to be.
But a perverted version of this canon applied exclusively to Russia—let’s call it Russialism—has emerged, proselytized by a particular set of Kremlin’s useful idiots. Their motivations and the tuning of their moral compasses remain a cosmic mystery.  John Mearsheimer . Samuel Charap . Stephen Walt . Thomas Graham . Richard Sakwa . I’m sure you can add to this list. Different styles, same insufferable arrogance, intellectual malpractice, and immunity to evidence.
Their version of “realism” operates with a shameless double standard. It explains, if not outright justifies, Russian aggression as an understandable reaction to NATO “expansion” or Western “encirclement,” threats that exist only in the Kremlin’s imagination and on these scholars’ op-ed pages.
We talk about cause and effect, not effect and cause, because sequencing matters.  NATO didn’t expand  so much as countries formerly occupied by Russia stampeded toward the alliance the moment they could. For people whose countries border Russia, and whose fears of invasion have since been vindicated beyond doubt, NATO membership was their best hope of real security and the prosperity that ensues from it.
For analysts convinced the world revolves around Washington—and that communism, rather than Russian imperialism, lay at the root of the Cold War standoff—the admission of Poland and the Baltic states was an “American move.” The dissonance of this twisted narrative is hard to miss when it so easily strips agency from Eastern Europeans whose choices were shaped by lived experience, not geopolitical abstraction. That same logic is now extended to Ukrainians, who live by a credo Americans would usually recognize: “Give me liberty, or give me death.” Ukrainians are not merely proclaiming it. They’re risking life and limb for it.
If America sought to menace Moscow, why has Ukraine spent a decade begging for NATO membership while Washington hemmed and hawed? Wouldn’t the “America the aggressor” narrative demand that Washington drag Ukraine into its alliance, or at least, arm it to the teeth to fight and win the so-called “proxy war”—another misnomer that delights the Kremlin every time a Western official or an opinion leader legitimizes it? NATO threatens Russia the way a lock threatens a thief.
Rather than applying realist logic consistently, these scholars amplify Russia’s made-up grievances while demanding  Western restraint . Their framework consistently privileges the aggressor’s claims while delegitimizing any effort to stop the aggression.
This is not Realpolitik. This is callous moral evasion dressed up as sophistication. The reality is that a ticking time bomb lies beneath the security order that delivered unprecedented prosperity and decades of relative peace—and these devout realists display a remarkable indifference to this reality. 
Ichkeria declared independence in 1991. Moscow responded with a campaign of annihilation. The results were all too predictable: leveled cities, mass graves, and subjugation until survivors accepted that they were “Russians again,” ruled by a Kremlin-installed enforcer, Ramzan Kadyrov, a modern-day feudal viceroy. The realists waved it away—an internal affair. Would we tolerate separatism at home? Not a precedent, not a warning. Move along.
This event could have but didn’t trigger Russia’s de-imperialization, as Algeria’s break from its metropole in 1962 forced France to abandon its colonial pretensions and reinvent itself as a modern European nation-state. The Soviet Union, the  Russian empire by another name , consisted of 15 republics. Chechnya wasn’t one of them, and so it remains, as Alexander Etkind  termed  it, an internal colony.
Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. Tanks crossed an internationally recognized border. Territory vanished from the map. The response? Hand-wringing, a ceasefire rewarding the aggressor, then business as usual. Surely, this is Moscow’s last territorial revision.
2014: Crimea annexed. Donbas set ablaze. Little green men of whom Putin knew nothing when they flooded the Ukrainian peninsula, until the day he recalled they were Russian troops. Again, we hear it’s “complicated.” Russia has “legitimate concerns,” pushback would be “reckless.” The world could have stopped Russia then. It chose not to.
2015: Russia begins bombing the democratic Syrian opposition. Foreshadowing the disinformation tactics it would use to persuade Westerners that Ukraine was riddled with Nazis, Russian propagandists insisted that Moscow was taking on ISIS—even as its jets leveled apartment buildings full of civilians, hospitals, and every fighting force that wasn’t made up of jihadis, leaving ISIS positions intact. The response? Thank God Russia is doing something about those jihadis. 
As Nobel Peace Prize laureate Oleksandra Matviichuk has warned repeatedly, “unpunished evil grows.” Having joined Assad’s campaign of mass murder—including chemical attacks on civilians—Russia’s appetite for war lost all bounds, culminating in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. But Russia has, apparently, earned the right to fool the same experts indefinitely. Their theory matters more than the mounting and irrefutable evidence before their eyes. Follow their advice, let Russia have its way, and Article 5 gets tested soon enough.
Then America and Europe will face a choice: send troops to fight Russia, or watch whatever remains of NATO after Trump’s threats to Greenland collapse in real time. Either path leads to an unraveling: defense budgets mushroom, the sense of normality dwindles, and the sound of World War III knocking on America’s door grows louder.
Failing to confront Russian aggression now  guarantees more of it later. The costs will be exponentially higher, and the options far worse. Only the willfully blind miss this.
Let us avoid sweeping generalizations. These scholars aren’t wrong about everything. But it’s worth identifying the pillars, made of sand, on which their arguments rest, even if they aren’t always explicit in their writing.
THE CULT OF STABILITY
In this perverted version of realism, stability means that borders stop moving and markets reopen. The ends justify the means, even if this craven version of stability rests on the torture of prisoners, the abduction of children, rape as a tool of control and oppression, the colonial extraction of wealth and resources, and the permanent denial of agency to entire societies.
In the case of Ukraine, this mindset produces an almost reflexive preference for freezing hostilities, with no regard for what comes next. To the realists, being oblivious to how such arrangements entrench conquest, reward violence, and defer the problem until the next war is perfectly acceptable. All hail stability, never mind that this word stands for an inevitable major escalation by the same aggressor a few months or years later.
“Peace at any cost” is the most dangerous oxymoron in circulation. If Ukraine made difficult concessions and abandoned its stubborn pride, we’d have peace, they say. Only the callous or ignorant buy this lunacy. If aggression pays, the  war expands .
THE “GREAT POWER” MANTRA
Russia is a great power, we are told, so it must be treated as one. Not “was,” not a “regional power,” but a “great power.” The claim is presented as self-evident, almost sacred. One could be forgiven for thinking that some Russia experts are writing from the 1970s, oblivious to how profoundly the world has  changed .
Great powers lead in at least one thing: culture, science, technology, ideology, demography. Something. By that standard, Russia fails across the board. Russia’s GDP is smaller than that of Texas. Putin, who hasn’t uttered a truthful word in decades, presents Russia as the defender of “traditional values.” That performance has found eager buyers in the West, including the vile Tucker Carlson, who treated a Kremlin infomercial as if it were a serious interview. Meanwhile, divorce rates in the “Third Rome ,” supposedly the epitome of righteousness and orthodoxy, are about 60 percent higher  than in the United States; Russia’s abortion rate is more than double Ukraine’s and roughly four times America’s.
Russia is a quintessential empire in demographic decline, with an economy built on extraction and rent, and a political model that doesn’t know how to manage a peaceful transfer of power and cannot legitimate itself without violence and conquest. 
“Women in Russia,” reported The Washington Post  in 2024,   “are being told to forgo education and careers to prioritize having many children.” Yet birthrates are far below replacement despite years of “traditional values” propaganda.
The technological picture is no better. The Sputnik moment once jolted America into investing in science. Today, Russia begs Iran for drones, buys what it can from China, and imports artillery shells from North Korea.  Citations  of Russian scientific dropped by 89 percent between 2021 and 2024, reflecting intellectual isolation and brain drain.
On every front that matters, Russia is decaying. Its only remaining claim to great-power status lies in a few thousand nuclear warheads, the use of which Xi Jinping has explicitly  taken off the table  for Putin. Beyond that, Russia’s edge consists of illicit operations aimed at sabotaging the West, driven by the hope that it can ruin others faster than it collapses at home. This is not a forward-looking or optimistic vision. Devoid of one, the Kremlin sows chaos so that its imaginary greatness can be projected against a world in crisis. It works well on Russian television. It is the antithesis of realism.
Russia’s battlefield performance offers no rescue either. If Moscow truly commanded the second-strongest army in the world, it would not be bogged down in Ukraine after years of war, watching its own oil refineries burn as its stockpiles of Soviet-era kit dwindle, especially since the West has repeatedly dragged its feet on decisive support.
THE KREMLIN’S “NATIONAL INTEREST”
Russia is not defending its national interest because  Russia is not a nation . It is an empire pretending to be a nation. “National interest” implies a demos with shared aspirations. Russia has no such thing. Sprawling over 11 time zones built on internal colonization, this Frankenstein state is composed of conquered peoples whose identities Moscow systematically  erases , whose youth it conscripts as cannon fodder, and whose resources it plunders in exchange for poverty and dreams (read nightmares) of “greatness.”
This matters. Voracious empires and nation-states operate on fundamentally different logics, a distinction that Russia-realists somehow miss. Nation-states pursue security, prosperity, and legitimacy through consent. To varying degrees, a nation-state serves its people. Empires derive legitimacy from domination itself, and the subjects serve the metropole. Strip away conquest and the Moscow-centered extraction machine has no answer to the most basic question: What is the Russian Federation for?
Without an external enemy to mobilize against or a weaker neighbor to subjugate, the entire construct becomes incoherent. What binds a Buryat conscript to a Muscovite bureaucrat but coercion? Why should Tatarstan’s oil wealth flow to Moscow’s plutocrats?
This is why aggression is both a policy choice and a  structural necessity  for the Kremlin. Each successive regime to rule over the  prison of nations  needs war to paper over the emptiness at Russia’s core. It kills to “protect,” occupies to “liberate,” and practices colonial domination while claiming to oppose it. To treat this as a rational pursuit of national interest is to fundamentally misunderstand what Russia is.
THE CHINA FANTASY
Then comes the  fantasy  that we can peel Russia off from China by letting it have Ukraine. Dance more vigorously to the Russian balalaika, we’re told, and Moscow will reorient itself from Beijing to Washington. A grand strategic bargain. The ultimate crowdpleaser: a “Reverse Kissinger.”
But the evidence points in the opposite direction. Russia’s pre-2022 marriage of convenience with China was transformed into a “no limits” friendship after Moscow launched its full-scale war. Russia is now a vassal state in an arrangement where President Xi holds all the cards.
By turning itself into a pariah, Moscow shackled itself to Beijing. Its partnerships with Iran and North Korea aren’t signs of strength but desperation. These are its lifelines. Pyongyang is now deploying troops to help Russia wage its criminal war. Realists who pride themselves on understanding power politics somehow miss the most humiliating asymmetry in Eurasia—China’s economy is ten times Russia’s.
The deeper problem is the premise that Russia is a normal balancer looking for an off-ramp. It’s not. If this revanchist empire, attempting to rewrite the security order by force, walks away with anything resembling victory, its alliance with China will harden into something far more dangerous and confident enough to rewrite rules, redraw borders, and challenge American power everywhere. That’s why the “deal” logic keeps producing outcomes where Russia and China gain, while America and Europe lose.
DENIAL OF AGENCY 
The most glaring blind spot in this worldview is the systematic refusal to acknowledge the existence of forty million Ukrainians. In Mearsheimer’s account, they’re featured only as victims, lacking agency or free will, a condescending framework that treats Central and Eastern Europeans as clueless pawns manipulated by “great powers.” Ukraine is reduced to a chessboard square, not even a pawn. The sacrifice of the bravest people on Earth, who are paying in blood for freedom and dignity, is brushed aside.
Meanwhile, Russia, where  the absence of agency  defines social organization, receives deference. Moscow is treated as a calculating subject whose red lines must be respected, whose “security concerns” justify its aggression.
The colonizer gets agency. The colonized are denied it.
This inversion isn’t accidental; it reflects an empire-bias baked into their worldview, an imperial mode of seeing. It’s precisely the logic Ukrainians are bleeding to defeat.
PUTIN THE REALIST
The biggest “realist” of all is Vladimir Putin himself, who came to power promising stability over chaos. The 1999 apartment bombings that killed nearly 300 Russians and catapulted him to presidency bore all the hallmarks of  FSB involvement . Multiple investigations, including by Russian journalists who were subsequently murdered, pointed directly at the security services. Putin’s era of “stability” began with the murder of the very citizens who clamored for it.
Russia’s newly elected president, who campaigned on law and order, promptly attacked Chechnya, crushing the rebellious province that dared to attempt decolonization. If you want to understand the moral and analytical bankruptcy of Moscow-centric realpolitik, start there. Putin’s “stability” is that of the boot on the neck. 
When faux-realists promise stability through concessions, they are rolling out a red carpet to welcome a bigger war. They offer suffering to those who don’t deserve it, telling us this is the justified cost of a “peaceful” settlement. They are wrong twice. It is not justified. And there will be no peace.
THE FOLLY OF RUSSIALISM
Authentic realism would start with the obvious: Russia’s war is not a misunderstanding, not a security dilemma, not a conflict between neighbors that spiraled out of control. It is an imperial war of conquest. There is a clear difference between invading and being invaded, a distinction some seem determined to blur.
Moscow’s legitimacy and the fragile stability of its political system rest on a recurring cycle of violence and domination, the appropriation of other nations’ resources and histories, and the subjugation of their peoples. When that cycle stalls, the Moscow-centric imperial machinery might turn inward and, some fear, crack. War is not an aberration but the glue that holds the so-called Federation together.
None of this should surprise us. George Kennan, whose 1946 “Long Telegram ” is still regarded as one of the most perceptive Western analyses of Russia ever produced, understood that Soviet ideology did not create Russian aggression, but merely gave it a vocabulary. Marxism, he wrote, became “a perfect vehicle for the sense of insecurity with which Bolsheviks, even more than previous Russian rulers, were afflicted,” justifying totalitarianism and cruelty.
Stripped of that ideological fig leaf, Kennan warned, the regime would stand exposed as “only the last of that long succession of cruel and wasteful Russian rulers” who compensated for internal weakness with military power. Communism, in other words, did not deform a nation-state; it settled on the fertile ground of an expansionist empire.
We misconceive of Russia and excuse it at our peril. And we have done so eagerly, despite overwhelming evidence, despite the  clear and present danger  it poses not just to Ukraine but to Europe, to the global security order, and to Russians themselves. Every attempt to explain away aggression as a strategy, grievance, or realism only postpones the reckoning and raises the cost.
The sober conclusion is not that Ukraine should surrender. The sober conclusion is that aggression must fail and be seen to fail. Not rhetorically, not symbolically, but materially. The war will end when Russia, and equally important, the world, learn that violence does not confer legitimacy.
