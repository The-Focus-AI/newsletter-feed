Dan and I discussed Russia’s efforts to impose upon Ukraine a Holodomor of Cold by freezing Ukrainians to death; the madness of Trump’s threats to Greenland, the fate of the Iranian protesters, and unfolding events in Syria. Dan believes there’s still a path—a narrow one—by which Americans can wrest control of the ship and prevent a catastrophe. I argue that it’s too late. Only the scale of the catastrophe remains to be determined. 
From Dan’s show notes: 
Today on Critical Conditions, Claire and I found ourselves disagreeing about the degree to which the damage Trump is doing to America’s power and prosperity is reversible. She calls NATO a “dead letter” and thinks the effects will be devastating for a century; my timeline is more compressed. But on the scale of the damage, we certainly agree. …
Claire argued that … a strategic rewiring is well underway. Canada no longer treats the United States as its unquestioned anchor and is hedging economically and strategically with China. Europe has stopped assuming that Washington will always be there and is moving rapidly toward autonomy, redesigning its defense posture, reducing dependence on American weapons, and preparing for a future in which NATO is no longer the central organizing structure of European security. She went so far as to say that NATO in its current form now exists mostly on paper—and to compare America’s decline to that of the Soviet Union. … All of this leads, in her view, to nuclear proliferation. If American security guarantees are no longer credible, countries will seek the one form of protection that does not depend on anyone else.
I pushed back by saying that what Claire is describing is real in direction, but is not final. The Soviet Union was built on lies and had no real allies that wanted to depend on it for anything. It was pure coercion, and its tenets were contrary to human nature. But America’s leadership of the free world was not built primarily on coercion or fantasy but on real economic power, real productivity, real innovation, real alliances of interest, and real shared values. That makes it far harder to erase.
… Moreover, Americans have not rejected the postwar system but fell asleep at the wheel and let an unqualified driver take over. It can be fixed in the midterms if the Democrats find a way to deliver Republicans the thrashing they so very richly deserve—and if the post-Trump Republicans recant. By November, none of these structural shifts will be complete.
If the United States returns to predictable, institutional leadership, allies will still find alignment with America preferable to dependence on China or accommodation with Russia. Europe may want more autonomy, but it does not want subordination to Beijing or exposure to Moscow. America remains the least bad anchor.
I even suggested that instability forces clarity. If Americans demonstrate that the virus has passed and the fever has lifted, a teaching moment beckons: None of us should ever again be indifferent to the political ascendance of absolute nuts. It Trump emerges as an aberration rather than a transformation, the alliance could reconstitute itself stronger, not weaker, because the danger was named and confronted.
That said, it was not all wine and roses from my end. I also noted that friends of the West are being betrayed in Iran. Trump urged the protesters to continue, to “take over” their institutions, and promised that “help was on its way.” They were massacred by the thousands, and help never came. Claire described this as a classic case of TACO: Trump Always Chickens Out.
I said that there is now a political vacuum around Iran. The Trumpist right does not care about democracy or human rights. For them, it does not matter whether the regime is liberal or genocidal, only whether it can be controlled and made to deal. They are comfortable leaving a mafia state in place as long as it knows who is boss. Trump must be the capo di tutti capi.
At the same time, the far left refuses to support regime change because it treats any intervention as imperialism, no matter how brutal the regime or how desperate the population.We also discussed Ukraine and Syria, two more places where American allies are being betrayed. It is a sad moment in history.
Here’s the article I mention by Robert Kagan . I emphatically agree with him:
… The American-dominated liberal world order is over. This is not because the United States proved materially incapable of sustaining it. Rather, the American order is over because the United States has decided that it no longer wishes to play its historically unprecedented role of providing global security. The American might that upheld the world order of the past 80 years will now be used instead to destroy it.
Americans are entering the most dangerous world they have known since World War II, one that will make the Cold War look like child’s play and the post–Cold War world like paradise. In fact, this new world will look a lot like the world prior to 1945, with multiple great powers and metastasizing competition and conflict. The US will have no reliable friends or allies and will have to depend entirely on its own strength to survive and prosper. This will require more military spending, not less, because the open access to overseas resources, markets, and strategic bases that Americans have enjoyed will no longer come as a benefit of the country’s alliances. Instead, they will have to be contested and defended against other great powers.
Americans are neither materially nor psychologically ready for this future. For eight decades, they have inhabited a liberal international order shaped by America’s predominant strength. They have grown accustomed to the world operating in a certain way: Largely agreeable and militarily passive European and Asian allies cooperate with the United States on economic and security issues. Challengers to the order, such as Russia and China, are constrained by the combined wealth and might of the US and its allies. Global trade is generally free and unhampered by geopolitical rivalry, oceans are safe for travel, and nuclear weapons are limited by agreements on their production and use. Americans are so accustomed to this basically peaceful, prosperous, and open world that they tend to think it is the normal state of international affairs, likely to continue indefinitely. They can’t imagine it unraveling, much less what that unraveling will mean for them.
… The consequence of a newly unreliable and even hostile United States … will likely be significant military buildups by former allies. This will not mean sharing the burden of collective security, because these rearmed nations will no longer be American allies. They will be independent great powers pursuing their own strategic interests in a multipolar world. They will owe nothing to the United States; on the contrary, they will view it with the same antagonism and fear that they direct toward Russia and China. Indeed, having been strategically abandoned by the US while suffering from American economic predation and possibly territorial aggression, they are likely to become hotbeds of anti-Americanism. At the very least, they will not be the same countries Americans know today.
And just as American strategy forces the Germans to rearm, it is ensuring that they do so in an ever more nationalistic, divided Europe. The founders of the American order worked in the postwar years to dampen European nationalism, in part by supporting pan-European institutions. The Cold War–era American diplomat George Kennan believed that European unification was the “only conceivable solution” for the German problem. Yet today those institutions are under pressure, and if the Trump administration has its way, they will disappear altogether. At the same time, the administration is trying to inflame European nationalism, especially in Germany, where it may well succeed. The right-wing nationalist Alternative for Germany is the second-largest party in Germany’s Parliament, just as the Nazi Party was in 1930.
… With no distant superpower to protect them, the Poles are likely to decide to build up their own military capability, including nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, France is but one election away from a nationalist victory that will hit Europe like an earthquake. French leaders have already told the country to prepare for war against Russia. But imagine a rearming, nationalist France facing a rearmed, nationalist Germany. The two nations might find common ground against mounting threats from the United States and Russia, but they also have a complex history, having fought three major wars against each other in the 70 years before the United States helped establish a durable peace between them.
Japanese rearmament will have similar ramifications. It will heighten the nervousness among Japan’s neighbors, including South Korea, another ally now unsure of Washington’s commitment to its defense. How long before the Koreans decide that they, too, need to rearm, including with nuclear weapons, as they face a hostile and nuclear-armed North Korea and a rearmed, possibly nuclear Japan, which has invaded and occupied Korea three times in the past?
… To recognize Russia’s and China’s spheres of interest would mean accepting their hegemony over a swath of nations that currently enjoy sovereign independence. And in this emerging new world, Russia and China will not be the only ones seeking to expand their spheres. If Germany and Japan need to become great powers again, they will have spheres of interest too, which will inevitably overlap with China’s and Russia’s, leading to numerous conflicts in the multipolar future just as in the multipolar past.
Which brings us to the much-trumpeted idea of a new accord among the United States, China, and Russia, equivalent to the 19th century’s Concert of Europe. A successful arrangement would have to settle on boundaries for their relative spheres of interest. Is such an agreement possible? The answer is no, because the new multipolar world will not have the same qualities as the one that prevailed two centuries ago. … China and Russia are not at all satiated, status quo powers. They are dissatisfied, have-not powers. Since the end of the Cold War, they have been chronically unhappy with American global supremacy and sought to restore what they regard as their natural and traditional regional dominance. Even today, China exercises only partial mastery over Southeast Asia, and it doesn’t control Taiwan, much less enjoy what it would deem the proper subservience from Japan and South Korea. Russia, too, is only in the early stages of rebuilding its traditional sphere in Eastern and Central Europe. Ukraine is not the end but the beginning of Putin’s envisioned order. 
… Beijing and Moscow have neither the desire nor the need for any restraining accord with the United States. On the contrary, they have every reason to believe that this is the moment to press on. Xi Jinping has spoken of “great changes unseen in a century,” which offer China a “period of strategic opportunity.” For Putin, Trump’s destruction of the transatlantic alliance is such a “great change.” Why shouldn’t he seize this opportunity? He can’t know how long the Trump phase will last in the United States, and if the Europeans rearm, the Kremlin’s window of opportunity may close. Until now, Putin has moved slowly, waiting six years between invading Georgia and annexing Crimea, and then another eight years before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which was severely hampered by America and its allies. The Americans have now shattered that solidarity, and Putin could well believe that this is the moment to speed up his plans for conquest.
… Trump’s megalomania is transforming the United States from international leader into international pariah, and the American people will suffer the consequences for years to come. Germany’s chancellor in 1916, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, worried that his nation’s behavior risked making it “the mad dog among nations” and would provoke “the condemnation of the entire civilized world.” He was right. German leaders were proud of their unflinching “realism,” and believed that the frank and brutal pursuit of self-interest was simply what nations did. But as the historian Paul Kennedy noted, Germany’s constant appeal “to the code of naked Machtpolitik ” helped unite the world’s great powers in bringing about Germany’s defeat.
… For decades, much of the world supported a United States that acted on these principles and accepted America’s power, despite its flaws and errors, precisely because it did not act solely out of narrow self-interest—much less in the narrow, selfish interest of a single ruler. That era is over. Trump has managed in just one year to destroy the American order that was, and he has weakened America’s ability to protect its interests in the world that will be. If Americans thought defending the liberal world order was too expensive, wait until they start paying for what comes next.
And here, Fareed Zakaria makes an extended version  of the argument I put to Dan. The world has begun routing around the United States. This process won’t be reversed, no matter what we do now: 
What is at stake here is not America’s image but its future power. China is methodically building one of the most resilient economic ecosystems in modern history, dominating critical mineral processing, achieving scale in batteries and electric vehicles and diversifying export markets to withstand shocks, sanctions and tariffs. The only credible US response is not tariffs—which over the past year have coincided with declining manufacturing employment—but ecosystem-building of our own. 
The United States still has an extraordinary advantage: a vast network of allies and partners that together control most of the world’s advanced technology, capital, skilled labor and consumer demand. … In practice, America has squandered much of that advantage. By treating allies as transactional customers, weaponizing tariffs against them and turning long-standing commitments into shakedowns, Washington has encouraged others to hedge. Most extraordinary, the US is no longer the trendsetter. It is retreating to protectionism and nationalism while the world is searching for more trade and cooperation.
For decades, the global order was built on an American platform. Trade flowed through US-designed institutions. Security rested on US guarantees. Crises were managed, for better or worse, by Washington. The global agenda was set in Washington. That platform still exists—but the world is no longer building on it. It is building around it.
We’ve been a superpower for so long that we came to believe this was the natural order of things. And it almost was. Breaking the path-dependency that made us so globally powerful, almost by default, required an immense effort—an utter explosion of insanity. But we managed.
