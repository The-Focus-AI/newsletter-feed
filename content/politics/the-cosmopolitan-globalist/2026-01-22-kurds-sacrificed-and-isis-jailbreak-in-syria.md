‼️ME201 assignment: Please read the articles below before Sunday (and please finish Assad or We Burn the Country, if you haven’t already). These are short articles—you should be able to read them all in about an hour or two. Make sure you’re conversant with all of the names, places, and groups mentioned. Come to class prepared to explain what’s happening in Syria’s Kurdish regions, and prepared to make an argument about:
Who’s telling the truth, 
What the US would do, if it made foreign policy rationally, in light of its national security interests;
What it should do in light of its values (pretend these are in evidence);
What other actors, such as the EU, should do.
For a summary and guide to the video above, scroll down.👇
🚨 Our reader Fatih Seyhanoğlu sent me the following, writing: “European police departments must be alert, and must alert Jewish communities, for ISIS. Most of them have EU, Canada, US passports.” 
To read the rest of this article, please subscribe. This will also give you admission to our ME201 discussion group, held every Sunday. 
The articles below are from Kurdish sources. Rudaw, based in Erbil, is reasonably reliable; it’s associated with Barzani’s KDP. It was temporarily banned in Syrian Kurdistan owing to its partisanship and—allegedly—its smear campaigns against Kurdish political parties that oppose the KDP. ANF, or the Firat News Agency, is headquartered in Amsterdam and PKK-affiliated. It’s typically banned in Turkey. It’s not necessarily reliable, but it’s a good guide to what the PKK wants people to know. Be sure to consider the sources as you assess these articles.
Thousands of Kurdish civilians are fleeing renewed clashes  between armed factions affiliated with Damascus, and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in what has become the latest chapter of a long and painful displacement. (Rudaw)
Since mid-January, the Syrian Arab Army and affiliated armed groups have advanced into areas held by the SDF in eastern Aleppo, as well as parts of Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and the Kurdish-majority Hasaka province.The SDF serves as the de facto military force of Kurdish-led northeast Syria (Rojava). Until Syria joined the US-led Coalition to Defeat ISIS in November, the Kurdish-led forces were the Coalition’s sole on-the-ground partner, playing a major role in ISIS’s territorial defeat in Syria in 2019. 
The military escalations have driven more than 500 families, numbers that may soon rise into the thousands, into Qamishli and surrounding areas of the Jazira canton since mid-January 2026. A ceasefire agreement signed earlier this month, intended to integrate SDF structures into state institutions, has proven fragile and repeatedly violated. Each breakdown brings renewed fear—not only of further displacement, but of broader instability, including threats to ISIS detention facilities and the specter of the group’s resurgence.
… One mother displaced from Afrin spoke through her grief. “We went everywhere, but no one listened to us. We were expelled from Afrin. We came to the eastern Euphrates, and again no one heard our voices. Where are we now? We have nowhere to go. We are inside this mosque, and each family has only two or three meters of space. … ” 
… “I want to go back to my home in Serekaniye. I want nothing else. Here, we are dying from the cold. We are exhausted. We have lived this life for seven years. Enough is enough. Kurds have rights too,” she said.
SDF: We were compelled to withdraw from Hol Camp due to the international community’s indifference.  The international community’s failure to assume its responsibilities in addressing the issue of imprisoned ISIS members in North-East Syria is posing serious risks for the entire region. (ANF)
The SDF said that al-Shaddadi Prison in southern Hesekê (Hasakah), which holds thousands of detainees from the terrorist organization ISIS, had been subjected to repeated attacks carried out by factions affiliated with Damascus. Although the prison is located approximately two kilometers from the International Coalition base in the area, the base did not intervene, despite repeated calls for intervention. SDF announced that Al-Shaddadi Prison had fallen outside the control of their forces as a result of these developments.
On the same day, the SDF shared footage showing militias affiliated with the Syrian Interim Government and supported by the Turkish state release ISIS members from the Shaddadi Prison.
On the other hand, the Al-Aqtan Prison north of Raqqa, which houses around 2,000 ISIS members, has been under attack by Syrian government–affiliated gangs since 18 January. The SDF and YPJ fighters, along with Counter-Terrorism Units, are resisting the assaults to prevent ISIS members from escaping. Despite calls to the International Coalition and international powers to take action to prevent escapes due to these attacks, no response has been received so far.
The SDF announced yesterday that many of their fighters had been martyred as a result of the ongoing attacks on al-Aqtan Prison. They noted that the prison holds the most dangerous ISIS fighters. The SDF-YPJ fighters guarding the prison issued an urgent call to the international community and called on the International Coalition to intervene against the militias attacking the prison with heavy weapons.
The prison was also attacked by a Turkish drone, causing material damage. The attack was an attempt by the militias to create chaos inside the prison, but the situation was quickly brought under control, yet there is a risk of escape for 2,000 ISIS fighters held in the prison.
CENTCOM says it has transferred 150 ISIS militants from northeastern Syria   to Iraq, planning to increase the number to 7,000.
The move comes a day after the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced on Tuesday that they had withdrawn their forces from the al-Hol camp, which houses ISIS-affiliated individuals, following “fierce clashes” with Damascus-affiliated armed groups in the surrounding area. The al-Hol camp, located southeast of Hasaka in northeastern Syria (Rojava), was previously managed by the SDF and its affiliated Internal Security Forces (Asayish). The camp hosted tens of thousands of people, including the spouses and children of former ISIS militants. 
Sheikhmous Ahmed, head of the camps department for internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees in Rojava, told Rudaw English on Tuesday that “a total of 7,130 families—25,183 individuals—were held at al-Hol camp prior to the SDF’s withdrawal.” He added that “it remains unclear how many detainees have fled and who currently controls the camp.”
Earlier on Monday, the SDF said it had lost control of another detention facility holding ISIS militants—the al-Shaddadi prison in southern Hasaka—to Damascus-affiliated forces and armed groups. SDF spokesperson Farhad Shami told Rudaw that around “1,500 ISIS militants, including both foreign and Syrian nationals, have been released” by Damascus-affiliated armed groups from the al-Shaddadi facility. [My emphasis. Talk about a buried lede.]
ISIS flag raised in Raqqa.  Gangs of HTS (al-Sharaa’s militia/party), ISIS, and the Turkish state, which are continuing their attacks on Rojava in Kurdistan, raised an ISIS flag at the entrance to Raqqa. (ANF)
The Kurdish-majority city of Kobane in northeast Syria  (Rojava) continues to witness clashes despite Damascus’s declared cessation of hostilities, a senior official from the Rojava administration said, warning that the symbolic city remains under siege, with water, electricity, and internet services cut off,  measures that “amount to war crimes.” (Rudaw)
The SDF accused “Damascus-affiliated armed factions”  of violating a ceasefire by targeting the Kurdish city of Kobane in Rojava and the al-Aqtan prison in Raqqa, which houses ISIS detainees. (Rudaw)
Damascus militias abduct two YPJ fighters in Deir ez-Zor region . Militias affiliated with the Transitional Damascus Government abducted two YPJ fighters in the Deir ez-Zor region. The incident sparked widespread public outrage. (ANF) (Note: A “Qandili” is a PKK member, after the Qandil mountains on the Iran-Iraq border—the PKK’s stronghold.)
YRK-HPJ: We are ready to join the resistance in Rojava.  The YRK and HPJ Command called on the Kurdish people and all freedom fighters to join the mobilization to defend the lands of Rojava Kurdistan. They also announced that they are ready to join the battle and resistance in Rojava. (ANF)
Civil society groups in Rojava warn of “imminent” humanitarian catastrophe.   According to the signatories, more than 50,000 civilians have been internally displaced, a figure that continues to rise amid severe shortages of food, medicine, medical supplies, and essential services. (Rudaw)
Barzani urges protection for Rojava Kurds in Italy talks.  (Rudaw)
UK lawmakers warn of “immense” threat to Kurds  in Rojava amid escalating violence. They asked the UK government to act to prevent further violence and protect civilians. (Rudaw)
If anyone can tell me what kind of aircraft that is, and what it might be doing, I’d be grateful—C.
Kurds in Kobane appeal to Elon Musk for internet.   Damascus’ Islamist-led authorities have cut communications and electricity amid ongoing abuses against Kurds. (Rudaw)
“This internet cut is so that the voice of the people of Kobani does not reach the outside and no one is aware of this genocide,” [a Kurdish resident] said, urging “Elon Musk to provide us with internet, because we fought terrorism on behalf of the entire world.” 
Amid the escalations, videos circulating on social media appear to show captured SDF fighters and civilians being insulted, beaten, and executed by armed men affiliated with Damascus. The SDF has also released footage showing several of its fighters being decapitated. Other videos show Kurdish female fighters and civilians being berated and threatened, with some militants implying they would be taken as sex slaves and be given as “gifts” for fellow fighters.
I can’t verify the following:
Rojava and Syria at war—a political assessment.   Since the outbreak of the Syrian war in 2011, the revolution in Rojava has repeatedly been targeted by a range of actors, including the so-called Islamic State, the Assad regime, and—most persistently—the Turkish state. (ANF) (Read this for an economical summary of the guiding ideology of the PKK—C.)
Rojava has made its decision, the rest is for colonial powers. As meetings in Damascus reach their end, the people of Rojava enter a new phase and humanity prepares to witness renewed resistance against ISIS and its backers:
Neither Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS, al-Sharaa’s militia) nor its leadership shows any genuine will to resolve the Syrian question or to safeguard the gains of the Rojava Revolution. Peaceful avenues pursued by Rojava, narrowed and constrained through the Imralı talks [Öcelan is imprisoned on Imralı—C.], were consistently blocked by Turkey. Those who believed that unconditional surrender could be imposed through blunt coercion, subtle pressure, or faits of accomplis were bound, sooner or later, to face confrontation on the battlefield. At this moment, when the knife has reached the bone, the war now underway is one that will determine the future of the Kurds.
Trump envoy, SDF commander   hold talks in Erbil amid northern Syria’s escalations. US Special Envoy for Syria Tom Barrack announced that he met on Thursday with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) Commander Mazloum Abdi and Ilham Ahmad, co-chair of the northeast Syria (Rojava) foreign relations office, in Erbil, the second meeting of its kind in less than a week to bring ongoing clashes between the Kurdish-led force and Damascus-affiliated factions to a halt and secure a lasting ceasefire.
Senior Republican lawmakers signaled a cautious wait-and-see approach  vis-à-vis the Ahmed al-Sharaa-led government in Syria, warning that US engagement should be contingent on the protection of the country’s ethnic and religious minorities, including the Kurds.
Syria pledged not to allow any entity to use its territory   for activities that threaten Chinese security and interests. Concerns persist over the presence of Uyghur jihadists in the country:
Since Assad’s fall, one of the most pressing issues concerning the international community—including China—has been the presence of thousands of battle-hardened foreign fighters in Syria. For Beijing, the primary concern is the Uyghur militants, whose status has become a point of friction with Syria’s new leadership, particularly after reports that many were integrated into the country’s emerging military structure.
Most of the fighters are affiliated with the Turkistan Islamic Party, which Beijing refers to as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement and designates as a terrorist organization. TIP militants played a key role in the anti-Assad campaign, operating mainly in Idlib province in northern Syria and maintaining close ties with HTS.
The following items are from the Syrian Arab News Service, which under Assad was pure regime propaganda; whether it is a more reliable source of news now, I can’t say, but I expect it’s a reliable guide to what the government wants us to understand about this situation:
Defense Ministry moves to discipline personnel in northeastern Syria operations: 
The Command of Security and Military Police at the Defense Ministry said Thursday that it has begun taking legal action against military personnel who violated conduct regulations during operations in northeastern Syria. It emphasized that breaches affecting military discipline or public order would not be tolerated.
The Command said in a statement that the military police identified several violations during military operations in northeastern Syria, despite clear directives that had been issued to all relevant units. The statement added that the ministry is pursuing legal measures in accordance with applicable regulations to hold offenders accountable, maintain discipline, and prevent similar incidents in the future. The Command also highlighted that most units have maintained a high level of discipline, with only a few isolated cases requiring corrective action.
This is now a familiar pattern—outrages followed by al Sharaa’s explanation that this wasn’t supposed to happen and isn’t official policy, plus promises to discipline those responsible. (It’s more reassurance than Americans have received about ICE’s behavior.) 
It’s plausible to me that this could be entirely true: It can’t easy to transform a jihadi mob into a disciplined national police force, after all; it makes perfect sense that there would be fighters who have been slow to understand the new directives. 
It’s also plausible that it’s nonsense, and that al Sharaa has given explicit orders that these outrages be carried out. I certainly couldn’t say which one it is. At least Damascus is admitting that something awful has happened, knows that this looks terrible, disavowed it, and promised to punish those responsible. Is it doing so for the sake of domestic comity, or to placate international investors and governments? (I suppose it doesn’t matter: if al-Sharaa consistently behaves the way international investors and governments demand, it will be good for domestic comity.)
To judge from the tone of the reporting in Kurdish outlets, however, the Kurds are not whatsoever convinced of the government’s good will. It might be a mistake to confuse the tone of that reporting with the views of ordinary men and women. Whether that reporting represents common sentiment, I simply don’t know—C.
Speaking of investors, there’s no need to read the following articles through unless you’re especially keen, but they’ll give you a sense of the energy with which Damascus is trying to revive the Syrian economy, and how they’re going about it:
The head of the Syrian Investment Authority,   Talal al-Hilali, met on Sunday with a delegation from the International Finance Corporation, part of the World Bank Group, to discuss the investment climate in Syria and prospects for cooperation, particularly in strategic energy sectors. (SANA)
Syria, IFC explore prospects for energy investment cooperation. 
Syria, UAE discuss strengthening banking and financial cooperation.  (SANA)
Syria signs two major phosphate deals to boost exports and investment. 
Syrian Central Bank Governor Abdelkader Husrieh   met with members of the Syrian Businessmen and Businesswomen Association to discuss how the private sector can support economic recovery, boost investor confidence, and strengthen the country’s financial system. The meeting addressed key issues including deposits made before May 8, 2025, lending mechanisms, banks’ role in currency exchange, and potential amendments to banking laws. (SANA)
Minister of Economy and Industry Nidal al-Shaar  met Turkish Ambassador to Syria Nuh Yilmaz to discuss ways of boosting economic cooperation between the two countries, with a focus on expanding direct investments and establishing joint production partnerships in priority sectors. Minister al-Shaar stressed that the current stage requires practical executive steps to support productive capital and open the door for the private sector in both countries to engage in joint projects that contribute to economic recovery and job creation. (SANA)
SANA also seems to be trying to educate Syrians about the Kurds, as this long feature suggests, and to explain why it makes sense that Kurdish will henceforth be a national language, and why Syrians will now celebrate Nowruz. Turkish officials also went through a “We celebrate Nowruz now” phase at some point during a failed peace process. (This inspired ridicule.) I don’t know whether that’s still being promoted. 
The Kurds in Syria:   A deep-rooted presence and an active role in the national fabric:
The Kurds constitute one of the most important social and cultural components of Syrian society and are widely recognized as the country’s second-largest ethnic group after Arabs. Throughout history, they have played an active role in Syria’s national, economic and cultural life, forming an essential part of the human mosaic that has long defined the country as a land of diversity and coexistence.
Syria’s Ministry of Energy  denied reports claiming that water supply to the city of Ain al-Arab (Kobani, also spelled Kobane) had been deliberately cut (see item above from Rudaw☝️), saying the government remains fully committed to providing water and electricity services to all citizens across the country. (SANA)
In a statement, the ministry explained that the current disruption stems from a technical failure at the Tishreen transformer, which was damaged in previous attacks on the region’s energy infrastructure by [the] SDF organization. Access for maintenance crews to the site is currently restricted, delaying necessary repairs and potentially extending the service interruption beyond usual periods.
A diplomatic source at Syria’s Foreign Ministry  said on Thursday that the SDF is responsible for breaching ceasefire agreements, adding that the Syrian government reserves the full right to protect national sovereignty and security. (SANA)
The source told SANA that the developments east of the Euphrates stem from the SDF policies pursued outside state authority, stressing that the government’s priority is enforcing the rule of law, protecting civilians, and ending the presence of illegal weapons. He said the March 10 agreement collapsed due to a lack of seriousness and attempts to impose a separatist reality by SDF. A new deal reached on January 18 followed the exhaustion of political channels and state intervention to restore stability, amid rising security risks, he added. Under the new agreement, all heavy and medium weapons are to be handed over to the Syrian state, the sole authority entitled to control arms, he said.
The source said all options remain open if the ceasefire fails again, ranging from political solutions to security or limited military action to protect civilians and end chaos. He added that integrating the SDF into state institutions is a sovereign internal matter, and that Syria is coordinating with allies and engaging friendly countries to underline that its actions aim to combat terrorism, prevent the return of ISIS, and safeguard regional security.
On ISIS detention facilities, the source said the Syrian government rejects the politicization of the issue and is ready to take over and secure the prisons, holding the SDF responsible for any violations.
The Syrian Arab Army said that the SDF   breached the ceasefire agreement and carried out several attacks, most notably targeting a military site containing explosive materials and suicide drones (a former SDF site), “which led to the martyrdom of a number of Syrian soldiers and the injury of many others.” (SANA)
Syria’s Minister of Defense, Major General Murhaf Abu Qasra,   urged the SDF to stop the arbitrary arrests of civilians in Hasakah province, warning that these actions threaten the ceasefire agreement. The Minister said: “Less than a day after the ceasefire came into force, the SDF began carrying out arbitrary arrests in Hasakah Province,” adding that these detentions of dozens of local residents “pose a serious threat to the ceasefire as a whole.” He called on the SDF to “immediately cease these arbitrary arrests and release all detainees without delay.” (SANA)
Syria’s Ministry of Interior announced that al-Hol camp and security prisons  in the provinces of Hasakah, Deir Ezzor, and Raqqa, where forces have recently been deployed, have been designated as restricted zones. The ministry said on its Telegram channel that efforts are underway to secure the areas, search for remaining escaped ISIS prisoners, and complete data collection needed to restore and maintain security at al-Hol camp and similar facilities. The ministry stressed that approaching these sites is strictly prohibited, warning that violators will face legal action and prosecution. (SANA)
The Syrian Arab Army’s Operations Command  warned civilians in Raqqa, Deir Ezzor, and eastern Aleppo to stay away from former SDF positions and tunnels, citing the presence of booby traps and explosives left behind by the group and PKK terrorists. The Command said that PKK terrorists and SDF elements had rigged doors, corridors, tunnels, household furniture, vehicles, and even homes near public roads. Explosives were also hidden in rocks, bricks, and other everyday objects, creating a significant hazard for anyone entering these areas. The warning also noted that mosques and religious texts, including copies of the Qur’an, were found booby-trapped, leading to casualties among civilians and military personnel. (SANA)
Trump praises Syrian president al-Sharaa’s performance at Davos . He said al-Sharaa was delivering “significant achievements” and working “very hard,” noting that the lifting of US sanctions represents an opportunity for Syria’s economic recovery. (SANA)
Trump also told Rudaw, “I like the Kurds,”  adding that “Kurds were paid tremendous amounts of money—we have given oil and other things. So, they were doing that for themselves, more so they were doing it for us. But we get along with the Kurds and we are trying to protect the Kurds.” (Rudaw)
Lindsey Graham threatened to renew “bone crushing” sanctions on the Syrian government if it continues to attack Kurdish forces. 
The whole tweet:
Eleven Syrian soldiers were martyred and 25 others injured  on Wednesday when the SDF attacked a facility near al-Yaarubiyah crossing in northeastern Hasakah, the Syrian Ministry of Defense said. The ministry’s said that the Syrian Arab Army had discovered a facility used to manufacture explosives and drone munitions, including several Iranian-made drones that the SDF organization was preparing to stockpile.
Iranian-made drones? Were they just lying around from the civil war (perfectly possible) or are the Iranians now using the Kurds to harass the new government (also perfectly possible)?—C. 
The Internal Security Command in the Damascus Countryside , in cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Department, arrested the criminal former Brigadier General Rateb Ali Ghanem, who served as Assistant Head of the Sa’sa Security Branch from 2010 to 2014 under the deposed regime. The Ministry of Interior said on its Telegram channel that initial investigations revealed that Ghanem held multiple security positions, including Head of the Military Security Branch in Hasakah,before becoming Assistant Head of the Sa’sa Branch. He was directly appointed to these posts by criminal Bashar al-Assad. The ministry added that during this period, Ghanem was involved in suppressing demonstrations, arresting large numbers of citizens, and engaging in repressive measures, including violations of fundamental rights and freedoms. (Relevant to our discussion with Adnan about bringing these people to justice.)
Outlawed groups continue terror, oppose reform initiatives in Sweida—Governor . (SANA)
Sweida Governor Mustafa al-Bakour on Wednesday condemned outlawed groups in the province, saying they continue to carry out attacks at a time that should be governed by justice and freedom. He added that these groups reject notions of patriotism and target every independent voice.
Al-Bakour said the gangs do not target only individuals but also aim to undermine the province’s history and the legacy of Sultan Pasha al-Atrash and the revolutionaries who fought for dignity. He described last week’s attack on the “Free Will” conference as part of an ongoing effort to suppress Sweida’s residents. The governor added that these groups oppose every reform initiative or attempt at progress, fearing stability because it exposes their history of looting and profiteering. He stressed that voices of truth in Sweida remain strong.
Recall our discussion about the Druze.
Here’s Daily Sabah, a Turkish government mouthpiece: 
Türkiye vows continued counterterrorism support to Syria. The Turkish Defense Ministry on Thursday said Syria went through a critical stage for stability with the integration of the terrorist group YPG and pledged that they would continue endorsing Damascus in the fight against terrorism:
Türkiye’s unwavering support for the new administration in Syria is strengthened further after Damascus dealt a blow to the autonomy ambitions of the US-backed terrorist group YPG in the past two weeks. The Ministry of National Defense said in a statement on Thursday that Türkiye supported the Syrian army’s operations, which started from Aleppo and extended to other areas occupied by the YPG.
… Syria’s government on Tuesday gave the YPG four days to submit a detailed plan for full integration into state institutions, marking a decisive step toward restoring central authority over the country’s northeast. In a statement issued late Tuesday, the deadline was part of a broader effort to achieve what it described as a “united and indivisible Syria” through dialogue and a peaceful transition, while warning that military options would remain on the table if negotiations fail. 
The announcement follows a series of talks between Damascus and the YPG over the future of Hassakeh province and other areas long outside government control. Syrian officials said preliminary agreements had been reached on key administrative and security issues, but stressed that implementation now depends on concrete steps by the group. The ministry said Türkiye is committed to supporting “one state, one army” in Syria and would continue helping the Syrian state’s fight against terrorist groups and boosting its defense capacity, to preserve its unity and territorial integrity.
The Syrian army’s operations ended the presence of the YPG in Aleppo’s two neighborhoods first. As the YPG withdrew, Syrian troops pushed further to the north, moving to clear Deir el-Zour and Raqqa from the terrorist group’s occupation. Eventually, the YPG accepted a deal with Damascus for their integration, which was originally included in the March 2025 deal.
The defeat of the YPG has triggered protests by groups sympathizing with the terrorist group PKK, with whom the YPG is affiliated. A mob tried to cross into Syria from Türkiye in the southeastern town of Nusaybin on Monday, and they took down the Turkish flag on the border, sparking outrage in the country where the flag is almost a sacred symbol. The Defense Ministry said in Thursday’s statement that the incidents were “an organized act of provocation.” “The state is doing what it should for perpetrators of the incidents. An administrative inquiry is also immediately launched after the incident,” the ministry said.
Critics of the incident have claimed that local authorities in Nusaybin failed to stop the flag incident, unlike a 1996 event in Cyprus where Turkish troops shot down a protester attempting to bring down a flag on a military post. (SABAH)
“YPG responsible for release of Daesh terrorists from prison.” 
Syria’s Interior Ministry said Monday that the PKK/YPG-dominated SDF is responsible for the release of Daesh terrorists from a prison in the Shaddadi area of northeastern Hassakeh, describing the incident as a grave threat to national, regional and international security.
In a written statement, the ministry said it holds the SDF “fully responsible for any security breach,” including the escape or release of Daesh members from prisons under their control. Such acts, it said, pose “a serious security threat to Syria, regional stability and international security.” The ministry said the issue of Daesh terrorist detainees has been “misrepresented in the media by the YPG and exploited for political purposes,” emphasizing that ensuring public safety, preserving social peace and preventing the return of terrorism remain “the highest national priorities.”
Regarding prisons holding Daesh members in Hassakeh province, the ministry said it is “fully prepared to assume the administration and security of these facilities in line with internationally recognized standards.” Warning that recent escape incidents at Shaddadi Prison pose a “serious danger,” the ministry said it is ready to coordinate directly with the United States to help secure stability and security in the region. The statement also noted that a special force is already deployed to ensure perimeter security and internal oversight of the prisons, adding that tighter measures will be implemented to prevent any escape or infiltration attempts. (SABAH)
Syria, US co-op recaptures all Daesh prisoners freed by YPG: 
US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Syrian authorities have recaptured all Daesh prisoners who escaped after being released by the YPG terrorist group, attributing the outcome to cooperation between Washington and Damascus “Working with the government of Syria and the new leader of Syria, they captured all the prisoners, put them back to jail,” he told the New York Post, describing the detainees as among the most dangerous globally. “We did a good job with Syria ... European prisoners were breaking, and I got it stopped,” said Trump.
The president defended sharing confidential exchanges with French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, saying they praised his work in stopping the breakout orchestrated by the terror group. NATO’s chief told the U.S. leader: “What you accomplished in Syria today is incredible,” while Macron wrote: “We are totally in line on Syria.”
Daesh detainees had been released by the YPG from the al-Shaddadi prison in northeastern Hassakeh province, according to the Syrian Interior Ministry, which held the terror organization responsible. The ministry said earlier that 81 of 120 escapees had been recaptured before Trump announced a complete recovery. Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa announced Sunday a cease-fire and agreement for full integration of the YPG into state institutions. (SABAH)
(One should not take Trump’s word for this, needless to say.) 
Syrian teens say they were forcibly recruited, abused by YPG terrorists: 
Two Syrian teenagers who were forcibly recruited by the YPG terrorist group described harsh conditions and practices inside the group’s camps, saying many other minors were also held in the group’s camps under similar conditions, according to interviews by Anadolu Agency (the Turkish state news agency).
The teenagers, identified as 16-year-old Bekir Feyiz Beleş and 17-year-old Hüsam Ibrahim Casim, said they were detained in December 2025 while attempting to cross illegally into Türkiye to find work. Both said they were stopped near the town of Ayn al-Arab and later forced into military service by the YPG. Hüsam, from the Manbij district of Aleppo province, said they were transferred to Hasakah, where they were compelled to undergo military and political training. He said fingerprints were taken under threat of force and that those who resisted were beaten. “They pressured us constantly,” Hüsam said. “When we protested, they forced us to the ground and beat us.” He described poor living conditions, including cold weather, lack of hot water and sleep deprivation. According to Hüsam, most of those held in the camp were under 18 and included youths from different ethnic backgrounds, as well as some foreign nationals who he said had also been detained against their will.

Why the YPG experiment in Syria ultimately failed . (This will give you a good sense of how Turkey views these things. All of these articles require you to read between the lines and put things in their historic and regional context.)
… The YPG, the most important component of the SDF, was hoping for an external intervention. It expected that the Western states would provide the necessary support to maintain the semi-independent political entity in Syria. It misinterpreted international developments and global dynamics once again. Neither the US nor any other Western country came to its aid. On the contrary, both the US and Western European countries have been trying to improve their relations with the Syrian government.
For a vivid demonstration of al-Jazeera’s agenda —and thus Qatar’s— consult their site today. You wouldn’t have even a hint that any of this is transpiring if you relied on al-Jazeera for news. And that’s their English site, which is far, far less radical than their Arabic site.—C.  
Odds and ends:
The West says silent as its Kurdish allies face attacks by Syria’s “reformed”  Islamist government.  We may see the wholesale destruction of the forces and the authority that paid the highest price to defeat ISIS:
The situation in northern Syria is moving fast. The conflict between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the army and auxiliaries of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, now subject to a partially observed four-day ceasefire, was probably inevitable. But few expected it to erupt with such sudden fury.
At present, Sharaa’s army, consisting for the most part of Sunni Islamist veterans of the long insurgency against the Assad dictatorship, is located on the edge of Syria’s majority Kurdish Hasakeh Province. In a lightning move at the beginning of the week, Damascus’s men crossed the Euphrates river and rapidly conquered two Arab-majority provinces, Deir al Zur and Raqqa. They then continued northwards, leading to a general mobilization of the Kurdish population, amid fears of a massacre.
These fears are not without basis, or precedent. Sharaa’s soldiers and the tribal host that accompanies them began, as they encountered Kurdish fighters and civilians, to behave towards them in ways that have become wearingly familiar to observers of the jihadi and tribal form of warfighting. Footage and evidence have emerged of captured SDF soldiers, including female fighters, summarily executed and in a number of cases beheaded. Civilians have been filmed by delighted jihadi fighters being forced to bark like dogs and recite rhymes of loyalty to “Abu Amsha” and various other Islamist commanders (many now re-badged as senior officers in the West-approved, Turkish-trained “New Syrian Army.”)
Perhaps most worrying of all, as they move into Hasakeh province, the Islamist army is beginning to approach areas where the bulk of ISIS prisoners and their families have been held since the demise of their “Caliphate” in 2019. So far, Sharaa’s men have moved past one such facility, a jail in Shaddadi, southern Hasakeh. A number of ISIS members escaped as a result. The Kurds suggest the number may be as high as 1,500. The government forces have also taken over the al-Hol encampment, where 24,000 relatives of ISIS prisoners were resident. An unknown number of these have also now departed the camp.
The clash between the Islamist authorities and the SDF was doomed to happen for two reasons: firstly and most fundamentally, because the government in Damascus is in the process of building a Sunni Islamic Syria, based on the austere, narrow precepts adhered to by the jihadi group that came down with Abu Mohammed al-Jolani from Syria’s northern Idlib province to assume rule in Damascus in December 2024.
A flavor of the worldview adhered to by that circle may be gleaned from perusing the career and statements of its chief religious authority, one Abd al-Rahim Atoun. In September 2021, Atoun delivered a lecture in Idleb entitled “Jihad and Resistance in the Islamic World: the Taliban as a Model.”
Kurds in Syria “sacrificed,” says head of Kurdish Institute of Paris :
… The issue obviously goes far beyond the fate of the Kurds alone. The fate of the Kurds matters because they defended not only their country and their territory, but also Europe, and humanity, against the Islamist scourge. More than 15,000 young Kurds were killed in that fight. They defeated Islamic State and captured tens of thousands of its members, who were held in camps. They have been doing this since 2014.
And how are they thanked? By being handed over to the Syrian regime and told “listen, your mission is over, find an arrangement with the new Syrian regime,” which is Islamist in nature, given that the current leader is a former jihadist.
So what will happen? The Kurds are faced with a dilemma. They are now confined to areas with a Kurdish majority. Either they come to terms with the regime by individually integrating into the new Syrian army, case by case, or they shift into resistance against this regime.
Syria’s energy sector faces structural, not symbolic, barriers.  Syria holds an estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil and 8.5 trillion cubic feet of gas, but reserves do not guarantee recovery.
The renewed fighting between the SDF and Syrian government.  Despite a ceasefire agreement, clashing visions of central authority and Kurdish autonomy are driving escalation in Hasakah and along the Turkish border.
The fall of Kobane will mark the rebirth of a new Islamic State.  What happens to the Kurds could be akin to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, when Serbs slaughtered 8,000 Bosnians.
Also of note, by Shay Khateri: Khamenei is testing Trump’s credibility.  If Trump does not follow through with his threat against the regime, Russia and China will see his rhetoric as empty.
Feel free, of course, to supplement this reading as you see fit. But come to class prepared to explain what’s happening in Syria; explain which of these accounts is, in your view, correct; and say what you think the world should do about it—particularly the United States, but look at it from other perspectives, too. 
Guide to the video
Last Sunday’s conversation with Adnan Hadad was fascinating. But it was more than three hours long. When a member of the group wrote to ask me for a copy of the video, I asked him whether I should share the video with all of our subscribers: Would anyone watch it, I asked? 
He replied:
Absolutely positively yes. … I believe, for what it’s worth, that it’s better to share the wealth and let the viewers/listeners determine whether the content is too lengthy, too difficult, or even incomprehensible than not make the content available; viewers/listeners will have no knowledge of what they miss out on in real-time or post-session unless you share. … people would be stupid not to want in on the intelligence and fun.*
 *Fun. After I downloaded the mp4, I played snatches to make certain it was all there, all playable and understandable. There was one moment deep in the session in which everyone was smiling and a few were laughing. So not all doom and gloom in the world leave alone ME201! :-)
So here’s the whole thing, with an AI-generated summary and table of contents:
Quick recap. The meeting focused on a detailed discussion about Syria’s political history and current situation, featuring Adnan’s firsthand experiences and insights. Adnan shared his personal journey from growing up in Dubai to his work in Syria’s independent media sector and eventual relocation to France due to political asylum. He provided extensive context about Syria’s complex history under the Assad regime, including Hafez Assad’s brutal suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood in Hama and Bashar Assad’s rise to power. The conversation explored the way Bashar Assad maintained control through a combination of sect-based military alliances, international relationships, and strategic alliances with Iran and Russia. The discussion concluded with Adnan’s reflections on the fall of Assad’s regime and the complex emotions it evoked among Syrians who had endured years of conflict and repression.
(00:00) Small talk and introductions. The meeting began with introductions and casual conversation, including discussion of current events such as the situation in Ukraine and reports of violence in Iran and Syria. 
(08:57) Adnan’s background. Adnan explained that he grew up in Dubai with Syrian parents and later moved to France after being denied a passport by the Syrian regime. He detailed his work in Syria, including helping to build independent media and documentary projects, before eventually seeking political asylum in France. Adnan also discussed his current role as an international development consultant and his plans to potentially apply for French residency rather than maintaining his political asylum status.
(17:34) Syria’s Path to Revolution. Adnan shared his personal experiences and historical context about Syria, explaining how the Assad regime’s oppressive tactics, including arbitrary detention and surveillance, created widespread discontent that eventually led to the revolution. He detailed how Hafez Assad’s brutal suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood in Hama in 1982 set a precedent for the regime’s ruthless response to dissent, which continued under Bashar Assad. The discussion also covered how different Arab countries responded to the Arab Spring, with Tunisia’s relatively peaceful transition contrasted with Syria’s violent conflict, which led to a new regime but ensured Assad’s regime would never return.
(32:25) Syria’s Assad Family and Conflict. Adnan discussed the complex history of the Assad family, highlighting Hafez Assad’s sectarian instincts and his efforts to secure his regime’s succession. He described Bashar Assad as a psychopath who sought to prove his competence and cruelty to his father, leading to increased violence and a failure to pursue moderation or reform. Claire and Adnan discussed the atrocities committed during the Syrian revolution. Adnan suggested that international intervention might have prevented some of the violence, but noted that such actions often have unintended consequences.
(42:59) Chemical Weapons Usage. Adnan discussed the international response to Syria’s chemical weapons use in 2012, arguing that stronger sanctions and support for the opposition could have been more effective than the half-measures taken. He criticized the West’s approach of sending non-lethal aid and ambulances, which became targets for Russian bombing. Adnan also reflected on the fragmented nature of the Syrian opposition and the challenges faced in uniting them. Claire asked about lessons for Iran, and Adnan suggested supporting a unified opposition while acknowledging the difficulties in predicting the effectiveness of international intervention.
(53:20) Syrian Rebel Governance Evolution. Adnan discussed his experience interviewing a former Al-Qaeda member in 2012, who expressed disdain for the group’s actions in Iraq and emphasized a desire to avoid repeating those mistakes in Syria. He described how Al-Jolani, a key figure in Syria, adapted his approach to governance by gradually moderating his stance and breaking away from both ISIS and Al-Qaeda, while maintaining support from his followers. Adnan also explained the complex dynamics between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by Mazloum Abdi, and Assad’s forces, highlighting a recent conflict in Aleppo and the strategic decisions made by Assad to integrate SDF into the new Syrian army.
(62:37) Syrian Government’s Euphrates Advances. Adnan explained the rapid military advances by the Syrian government in the eastern Euphrates region, noting that Kurdish areas are defecting en masse due to perceived tolerance and concessions like recognizing Kurdish as a national language. He predicted the government would stop its offensive near Hasakah and Qamishli, accepting an agreement to maintain the SDF in a nominal authority while taking control of oil fields and hydroelectric dams. The group discussed the status of ISIS prisoners, with Adnan suggesting that non-Syrian prisoners should be repatriated while Syrian prisoners should be imprisoned, though he expressed concern about the long-term prospects of reintegration and the potential for future violence.
(76:53) Syrian Extremists and Government Accountability. Adnan discussed the need for Western governments to take responsibility for their citizens who joined extremist groups in Syria, comparing it to how other countries would respond if the situation were reversed. He explained that many former members of Syria’s security apparatus, the Mukhabarat, are now unemployed and trying to survive, while others have been integrated into society or are working in restaurants and taxis. Adnan emphasized that transitional justice is non-existent in Syria, which he views as a major issue for the legitimacy of the new government. He also described how the regime kept detailed records of detainees and prisoners, which has been both a tool for control and a source of documentation for human rights abuses.
(94:51) Syria’s Power Dynamics and Consolidation. Adnan explained the complex history of Syria’s power dynamics, noting that Sunni elites historically held power but tolerated non-Sunni leaders as long as they were included in government. He described how Bashar al-Assad’s father, Hafez, gradually consolidated power by forming alliances with minority groups and making strategic deals, including a controversial agreement with Israel. Adnan also detailed how Bashar initially appeared promising with reforms like internet access and economic openness, but soon became increasingly authoritarian, doubling down on corruption and consolidating power among oligarchs, leading to widespread discontent among the Syrian people.
(105:45) Syria’s Shifting Iran Relations. Adnan discussed Syria’s complex relationship with Iran under Bashar al-Assad, explaining how Assad initially maintained a balanced relationship with Iran while avoiding complete subservience. He described how the situation changed when Hezbollah and Iran’s influence grew stronger, leading to a split between Russian and Iranian allegiances within Assad’s inner circle. 
(112:21) How Syria has changed. Adnan expressed deep emotional relief when Assad fell, noting that while the new regime is far from perfect, Syrians now feel a sense of hope and freedom to express themselves more openly, though political parties remain banned and true decision-making power remains concentrated in a small circle around the president.
(122:10) Syria’s Path to National Healing. Adnan discussed the changes in Syria, noting improvements in tolerance, services, and governance, though he highlighted limited women’s participation in leadership roles. He expressed skepticism about Syria’s ability to heal as a nation, emphasizing the need for a shift from binary thinking and greater acceptance among different groups. Adnan also shared his views on Iran, predicting the eventual collapse of the regime due to internal and external pressures, and suggested the need for a new, unified leadership to guide Iran’s future.
(133:57) Syria’s Path to Democratic Reconstruction. Adnan discussed the challenges and opportunities for Syria’s political transition and reconstruction, emphasizing the need for a democratic system to prevent future revolutions. He explained that Syria is seeking investment through equity rather than debt to avoid becoming dependent on international financial institutions, which could restrict their ability to buy from countries like China. Adnan also noted that Syria’s oil and gas resources, located in the east, are in relatively good condition and will soon be operational again, providing a potential source of revenue for the country’s reconstruction.
(140:10) Syria’s Energy and Peace Initiatives. Adnan discussed Syria’s oil and gas potential, noting that while Syria could produce around 100,000 barrels per day, the country’s focus should be on exporting energy rather than raw materials to neighboring countries like Iraq and Lebanon. He also shared insights on Syria-Israel relations, explaining that Syrians have shifted their perspective on Israel, moving away from anti-Semitic sentiments towards a desire for peaceful coexistence. Adnan emphasized that the current obstacle to forming a lasting peace is not the Syrian government but the Israeli government, particularly the Netanyahu administration. He also clarified that Syrians are no longer interested in regaining control of the Golan Heights, instead offering to return to the 1974 borders and deploy UN peacekeeping forces.
(143:13) Middle East Regional Security Dynamics. Adnan and Claire discussed the complex dynamics between Israel and Syria, particularly focusing on the Druze community in Sweida. Adnan suggested that the Israeli government may not fully trust the Syrian government and is wary of a Syria that could pose a future threat. Claire and James explored the implications of a potential Kurdish region in a disintegrating Iran, which could further complicate the situation in Syria. David M. raised concerns about unemployed and disaffected young men in the Middle East and North Africa, which Adnan attributed to economic policies favoring the wealthy and corrupt, rather than widespread anger.
(164:42) Middle East Social Dynamics. The group discussed social dynamics and cultural practices in the Middle East, particularly focusing on gender roles and public behavior in Syria. Adnan explained that while in some areas men showed aggressive behavior, this varied significantly by region and was influenced by factors like poverty, lack of education, and conservative attitudes toward women. The conversation also covered the fate of Palestinian refugees in Syria, with Adnan noting that many Syrian-Palestinians who have lived in the country for decades may soon receive Syrian citizenship following a precedent set with Kurds. The discussion concluded with a brief comparison of Iraq and Syria’s economic situations, highlighting Iraq’s relative prosperity despite corruption and Syria’s severe housing shortage.
Let me know if you watch any or all of this; I’ll be curious.
