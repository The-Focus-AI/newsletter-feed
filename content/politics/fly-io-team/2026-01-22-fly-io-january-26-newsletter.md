Fly.io Newsletter

Hi there,

It's been a minute, but that's because we've been busy working on something pretty fun: Sprites ( https://sprites.dev/?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )! They're stateful sandbox environments that you can easily checkpoint and restore. Thomas says they're "ball-point disposable computers," ( https://fly.io/blog/design-and-implementation/?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io ) but whatever you call them, they're probably worth checking out if you're sick of trying to build or test anything in ephemeral sandboxes.

You only pay for the resources you actually consume while running them, but you can kick the tires now with $30 of free credit. Let us know what you build!

Product updates

The Fresh Produce ( https://community.fly.io/c/fresh-produce/27?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io ) section of our Community Forum is where we update y'all on what's new. There's a lot over there about Sprites, but there's some other important stuff going on, too:

* Postgres 17 is here ( https://community.fly.io/t/you-asked-and-we-shipped-postgres-17-on-mpg/26430?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )! (For people who like shiny new indexes, planner improvements, and general "Postgres got faster again" vibes.)
* The experience of launching an app from the dashboard got a makeover! ( https://community.fly.io/t/launch-your-app-from-the-dashboard-better-ui-heck-yeah/26838?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

Inside Flyball

We're excited be able to share Sprites with you, and we're honestly having fun using them ourselves. We ran a lil "show and tell" at our last Town Hall meeting; here are a couple of things that the folks working at Fly.io are building:

* A progressive web app chat UI ( https://github.com/clouvet/sprite-mobile?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io ) for accessing Claude Code running in YOLO mode on a Sprite, an ideal vibe-coding interface on your phone. It allows input by text, voice, and image, persists sessions across clients, and seamlessly networks with your other Sprites through Tailscale.
* spritessh ( https://github.com/jbellerb/spritessh?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io ) is a simple bridge so your legacy (anything older than 1 week) tools can use Sprites over plain SSH.
* A project ( https://github.com/symkat/Fly-Workspaces?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io ) that provisions code-server to your Sprite so that you can do development work from anywhere you have a web browser, even an iPad!
* Bookworm ( https://bookworm-demo-v53c.sprites.app/?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io ): A 100% vibe-coded web app, running on a Sprite, for tracking your book reading list. You can search for books and add them to your list (powered by the Open Library API) or add them manually, then mark them as started/finished reading.

Feature story

We'd normally do a whole thing here, diving into the background of what Sprites are and how they were designed, but Kurt and Thomas wrote quite a few words on those topics already, so we'll send you straight to the source:

* What are Sprites, exactly? ( https://fly.io/blog/code-and-let-live/?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )
* The Design & Implementation of Sprites ( https://fly.io/blog/design-and-implementation/?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )

Thoughts/comments/cool stuff you've spun up on Sprites since you started reading this two minutes ago? You know where to find us. (On the other side of this newsletter! Just hit "reply.")

Thanks,

The Fly.io Team
