This is a column about Claude Code. My boyfriend works at Anthropic. See my full ethics disclosure here [https://www.platformer.news/r/ff01ed35?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670].

Three years ago this month, the prominent AI researcher and commentator Andrej Karpathy declared that “the hottest new programming language is English [https://www.platformer.news/r/b8ad988f?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670].” At the time, ChatGPT was less than two months old, and millions of people were discovering that natural language could now be used to generate code. GPT-3.5 had demonstrated that large language models could follow complex instructions with increasing reliability. Karpathy’s tweet predicted a world where knowledge of a programming language would no longer be required to program.

At the time, I remember a CEO friend of mine gently scoffing at the idea of English as a programming language. As the leader of an engineering team, he spent all day “programming” in English: giving projects to his engineers and telling them what to build. The method was less reliable than you might expect, he told me. In the eternal quest to build digital products by describing them in words, something almost always gets lost in translation.

Over the next three years, the CEO’s experience matched my own. English is the only language in which I am fluent, and for the most part it made for a poor programming language. Unable to write anything more complicated than HTML, I found that the advent of vibe coding (another Karpathy coinage) largely passed me by. After every major new model release, I would dutifully ask it to build me some basic but ultimately useless piece of software. Programming remained something other people did. 

As I noted last week, the release of Claude Opus 4.5 in Claude Code changed that [https://www.platformer.news/r/aabd74fe?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]. In just about an hour of typing into a box — of programming in English, as Karpathy put it — I made a personal website that far surpassed anything I had been able to put together in Squarespace. Like my CEO friend’s engineers, Claude regularly made strange choices and outright errors that I would have to correct. Without too much effort, though, I was able to get the site that I asked for — as well as several features I never would have thought to build had Claude not suggested them.

In the week since, amid a general craze for Claude Code, I have let my imagination run wild. In just a few days, I built a series of tools I expect to return to over and over again to help me in my work. As with my website, I don’t understand the underlying code at all. But for the moment, anyway, I’m not certain it matters. 

ChatGPT was the moment when people woke up [https://www.platformer.news/r/a34694b5?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] to the power of LLMs to generate text. The Claude Code moment, while orders of magnitude smaller, strikes me as potentially just as significant. It's waking people up to LLMs' power to generate tools. And I suspect the consequences of this strange new ability will reverberate over the next several years. 

In the spirit of showing rather than telling, today I wanted to share a few of the things I’ve built for myself as a writer. Some are tools I’ve wanted for years. Others were suggested by Claude itself. All are things that I would not have been able to create before a few months ago.

A couple caveats up top. One is that I’m not interested in AI tools that do the writing for me. I occasionally experiment with trying to get models to write in my voice, for the same reason you might check the area surrounding your tent for grizzly bears before camping for the night. But I’m almost always more interested in tools that improve my thinking, rather than substitute for it. 

That’s why you’ll note that a common thread running through these tools is that they help me make sense of things. To cover technology is to be at the center of a sprawling collection of characters, events, narratives, and history. Tools that help me capture and organize them are invaluable to me. 

Second, given my conflict of interest [https://www.platformer.news/r/e0ce0f36?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670], I realize today’s edition may come across as wide-eyed Claude-glazing. Should that be a concern, I encourage you to swap out Claude for OpenAI’s similar Codex [https://www.platformer.news/r/208ce868?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] or Google’s Antigravity [https://www.platformer.news/r/4575b39c?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670], both of which should be capable of building software of similar quality. My goal here is not to persuade you to use any particular framework to tackle your project; it’s simply to suggest what is newly possible.

If nothing else, Claude Code fulfills a desperate need that every writer has at one time or another: to procrastinate. So, with that said, here are some things writers can build with the tools now available — along with some notes on the obstacles I still find myself running into.

----------------------------------------

 

Build a website. While I covered this last week, it’s worth saying that I think a website is the ideal place to start after downloading Claude Code. Every writer can benefit from having a website, and you probably already have a few things in mind for what might belong there. (If you don’t, ask Claude for some ideas.) 

Building a website with Claude Code will help familiarize you with the basic rhythms of this work. Type what you want into the box; Claude either goes forth and does it or asks follow-up questions to help you refine your idea. Look at the resulting product, then tell Claude what you want it to change.

The best part about this project is that you don’t even have to publish the site Claude makes for you — you can just spend an hour or so building something locally and tweaking it to your liking. 

If you do like what you build, you can publish your site more cheaply than you would on Squarespace using a service like Netlify [https://www.platformer.news/r/664ff335?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] (which I’m using at the moment) or GitHub Pages [https://www.platformer.news/r/5564a62e?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]. As a bonus, you can integrate a simple blog onto your site. I used micro.blog [https://www.platformer.news/r/5a7659e2?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]. 

Where Claude falls short: If you’re working on local files, Claude moves very quickly. If it has to debug anything in your browser, though, it will go much more slowly, and ask for permission at every step of the way. I implemented a simple website in about an hour; the blog, which involved lots of Code poking around in various online services in Chrome tabs, was a half-day project. There was probably a faster way to do it, and I’ll never know what it is!

----------------------------------------

 

Build a searchable database of your own work. I’ve always wanted a database of my writing that I could run semantic queries on. Stuff like: “When was the last time I wrote a column about Grok?” Or, “what criticisms have people made of the Meta Oversight Board?” It is possible to get answers to these questions via Google. But I’ve always wanted answers grounded in my own work, with quick links to the relevant materials. 

After describing this idea to Claude, it went to work. It exported 818 editions of Platformer into a folder of text files organized by date, and then connected it to Claude. Now when I ask Claude questions about my archive, it reads through relevant posts and gives me an answer. I have wanted something like this for nearly half a decade now, and Claude built it in less than half an hour. 

Where Claude falls short: For the moment, I haven’t figured out how to set up automated exports of new columns into my database. I also can’t easily add work to the database from before I started Platformer. I hope to work on both issues over time.

----------------------------------------

 

Build an automated daily briefing for yourself. Every day I wake up and read Techmeme [https://www.platformer.news/r/e7ca4402?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] to see which stories might be worthy of analysis or follow-up reporting. I wondered if I could generate a custom briefing based on my particular interests and the companies I cover. It would be helpful if the briefing was structured the way we structure Platformer: with suggestions for a column on top, followed by suggestions for Following items, followed by the rest of the day’s links.

What would make it particularly useful is if it had context about what I had written about recently. Claude managed to build all of this within an hour. It has access to the Platformer archive, letting it rank stories likely to interest me and suggest column ideas based on my actual work.

Claude wrote a script to generate a briefing like this every day just before 6AM, and text me when it’s ready to read.

You can see what one of these briefings looks like here [https://www.platformer.news/r/8a8e202e?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670].

Where Claude falls short: The rankings are imperfect. And the mechanism for texting me each day’s briefing seems to have broken. Something to ask Claude about!

----------------------------------------

 

Build a companion for your journal. As a longtime journaler, I’ve often wished I could ask questions of it. What was going on for me this time last year? When’s the last time I saw my brother? What’s everything I’ve tried so far to address burnout? 

After I got my Platformer database working, I built something similar for my journal. I set up automated exports from my journaling tool, Capacities, and created a searchable archive of more than 1,200 notes. It indexed my journal and ran it through an embedding model (from OpenAI) to create clusters of meaning. Now, when I enter a query, Claude searches for relevant passages, ranks them, and synthesizes an answer. 

Where Claude falls short: Honestly, I wish this were a native feature in Capacities. Until then, though, this works.

----------------------------------------

 

Build a briefing document about the story you're working on. By the time I’ve decided to write a column about something, there has often been coverage of the issue in multiple outlets. It will have been discussed in public on social media. And it will have some larger context around it: a timeline of events leading up to it, for example, or a set of related stories that have brought it to everyone’s attention.

You can assemble a lot of that information by Googling. But I wondered if I could get something that worked a little faster. And so I had Claude build a tool called “brief.” After typing that word into Claude Code, I enter a prompt about whatever story I’m working on. It then assembles a document and saves it onto a folder on my computer.

Here’s a sample brief [https://www.platformer.news/r/226825a9?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] about the Grok controversy from the past week. Here’s one about this week’s Meta layoffs and reorganization [https://www.platformer.news/r/6c50eb4f?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]. I find this tool useful in cases where I'm parachuting into a subject cold and want to get up to speed quickly. It’s also good for reminding me of recent history that I might have forgotten, and suggesting questions that may still be unanswered and worth exploring.

Where Claude falls short: I actually just built this one today. We’ll find out!

On the podcast this week: Jonathan Haidt returns to the show to discuss his new research on the question of whether social media has harmed teenagers. Then, Kevin and I review your vibe coding experiments. And finally, Search Engine's PJ Vogt stops by to discuss the first week of The Forkiverse [https://www.platformer.news/r/e75f46d4?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670].

Elon Musk caves on Grok (but only on X)

What happened: After weeks of backlash over the widespread creation of nonconsensual sexualized deepfakes of women and children (which could potentially be CSAM), X finally said [https://www.platformer.news/r/dd2eb95a?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] it “implemented technological measures” to prevent the Grok account from editing images of real people “in revealing clothing such as bikinis."

The company is also geo-blocking the ability for users to generate explicit images where that content is illegal, it said.

While the problem seems to be largely under control on X, multiple researchers and journalists have found that “nudifying” images can still be generated [https://www.platformer.news/r/b9306e3e?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] on the Grok app, including with free accounts. 

The ability to ask Grok to create and edit images on X is now only available to paid subscribers, mirroring an earlier move that limits the ability to “nudify” real people to paid subscribers. (The move generated criticism from UK officials, with technology secretary Liz Kendall saying [https://www.platformer.news/r/d7c4d8eb?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] it was “effectively monetizing this horrific crime.”)

Why we’re following: X and Elon Musk have largely tried to ignore the problem. Even after multiple reports and tests from researchers, Musk claimed [https://www.platformer.news/r/ac5a3c40?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.”

This week California joined [https://www.platformer.news/r/0ccd659d?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] governments around the world, including the UK and European Union, in opening an investigation into xAI over the issue.

What people are saying: X said [https://www.platformer.news/r/0c6cd201?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] it continues to have “zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content,” despite tolerating the content for at least two weeks.

When asked about the Defiance Act, which recently passed [https://www.platformer.news/r/db576d76?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] unanimously in the Senate and seeks to allow victims of nonconsensual explicit AI images the right to sue, Republican Rep. and speaker of the House Mike Johnson said [https://www.platformer.news/r/0a0b6248?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] he was “certainly in favor of it,” adding “it should be a big bipartisan concern. We need to protect children online and we need to stop these abuses. It’s terrible, it’s horrible.”

Ashley St. Clair, a mother to one of Musk's children, sued xAI today [https://www.platformer.news/r/10b00ca2?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] after Grok made non-consensual intimate images of her.

Is Thinking Machines imploding?

What happened: Two cofounders of Thinking Machines Lab have left [https://www.platformer.news/r/ab506de2?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] to rejoin OpenAI. The buzzy startup led by ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati now has only three of its six cofounders left, after less than a year of existence (they lost another to Meta last year). 

Cofounders Barret Zoph and Luke Metz, senior employee Sam Schoenholz, and two more staffers [https://www.platformer.news/r/eb92dacc?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] are leaving for OpenAI.

Why we’re following: Thinking Machines has had a big first year: they raised a record $2 billion seed round this summer, and were in talks last year for a new round at a ludicrous $50 billion valuation. But losing this core talent, to the company their co-founders left, seems like a bad sign. 

Doubly so given their current high valuation seems to be based on the strength of their talent; Thinking Machines has made some cool research tools [https://www.platformer.news/r/1d1a6b7e?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670], but not any huge AI releases.

It's also fascinating given Murati's prominent but under-discussed role [https://www.platformer.news/r/db6cb87c?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] in Sam Altman's brief ouster from OpenAI.

What people are saying: Zoph’s departure has stirred up much speculation. The news was initially broken by reporter Kylie Robison on X, who wrote [https://www.platformer.news/r/1046354f?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] Zoph was terminated “due to unethical conduct,” according to sources familiar with the matter. 

What was this “unethical conduct”? Well, a source told [https://www.platformer.news/r/42831283?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] Wired that Zoph shared confidential company information with competitors. 

Wired also reported that OpenAI CEO of Applications Fidji Simo said she doesn't share Murati’s concerns about Zoph, in a memo to OpenAI employees. 

In a later article, Wired added even more details [https://www.platformer.news/r/6d09066f?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]. The outlet reported that the firing was allegedly due to an unspecified case of “serious misconduct” from Zoph last year, and Murati didn’t know he was leaving for OpenAI before firing him on Wednesday. Also, apparently the sharing of confidential information only came out after the firing.

But (bear with me on this one): different sources talked to Wired, saying Simo claimed Murati was told Monday, two days before his firing, in an internal OpenAI memo. That likely means somebody isn’t telling the truth about whether it was a “you can’t quit, you’re fired” situation.

Interestingly, Simo announced [https://www.platformer.news/r/25d965a1?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] the three ex-Thinking Machines employees’ arrivals on X with a note that it had been “in the works for several weeks.”

Onlookers on X were speculating about what the deal with the allegations against Zoph was. “feels like the type of character assassination leak you put out,” said [https://www.platformer.news/r/20f4f1c4?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] Deepmind (and ex-OpenAI) research engineer Susan Zhang, “when you find out one of your cofounders might be splitting off.”

But CEO Mira Murati kept it brief in her announcement of the departure on X, saying [https://www.platformer.news/r/07934b35?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] “We have parted ways with Barret Zoph,” and Thinking Machines was “excited” that Soumith Chintala would step into the CTO role.

Chris Paxton, AI researcher at Agility Robotics, congratulated [https://www.platformer.news/r/d70000e3?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] Thinking Machines’ new CTO: “Huge news for Soumith, he'll be a great CTO for leading... whatever it is Thinky does.”
