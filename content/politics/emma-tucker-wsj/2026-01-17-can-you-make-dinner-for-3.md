Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently suggested that Americans could put together a dinner for $3 amid stubbornly high grocery prices.

 

Her menu option: A piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, a corn tortilla and one other item.

 

So WSJ reporters went to grocery stores in two cities, Boston and New Orleans, to see if that $3 meal budget was really doable.

 

This week we also look at Florida’s growing unaffordability, your ideal wake-up time and the unlikely person powering Indiana University’s football success.

 

Enjoy your weekend with these and all the great reads below.
