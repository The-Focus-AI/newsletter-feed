✏️ Jamie Dimon, one of the most powerful CEOs in the country, has spent months performing a delicate balancing act to stay on President Trump’s good side. In public, the JPMorgan chief has backed much of Trump’s agenda, reserving his sharper critiques for private conversations with the president. But that rapport  may have reached its limits [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/jamie-dimon-trump-jpmorgan-3d63a020] with the fight over Fed Chair Jerome Powell. We take you inside the widening rift between the White House and Wall Street’s most seasoned diplomat.

Jamie Dimon seemed to have Trump figured out—until this week.

As the longtime head of the nation’s biggest bank, Dimon has enjoyed a level of celebrity and public respect that few other executives have. It has allowed the outspoken 69-year-old billionaire the ability to  stick his neck out [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/jamie-dimon-trump-jpmorgan-3d63a020] and fight for policies he says are crucial for American prosperity. But Trump’s return to power and vow to go after those who shunned him— including JPMorgan—have changed that. Now, Trump is actively threatening JPMorgan’s business and the Fed’s independence, and even Dimon seems at a loss for how to respond, report Alexander Saeedy, AnnaMaria Andriotis, Emily Glazer and Brian Schwartz.

Welcome to Greenland, an economy reliant on subsidies and shrimp.

Greenland is prized by Trump as the real-estate purchase of a lifetime. It boasts a strategic location and untapped mineral reserves. However, the economy is reliant on  something more prosaic [https://www.wsj.com/economy/welcome-to-greenland-an-economy-reliant-on-subsidies-and-shrimp-27f35ced]: fishing and a recent surge in investment to build new airports. But revenue from both of these is trending down. Greenlandic officials quietly concede that, in the short term at least, anyone running this island is more likely to find themselves staring down a money pit rather than a gold mine, reports Max Colchester.

After a visit to the White House, top officials from Denmark and Greenland said  they hadn’t persuaded [https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-says-greenland-is-vital-for-u-s-s-national-security-ecae028b] Trump to abandon his ambitions to annex the territory.

Q: Could a jump to the trades be the way out of a white-collar career slump?

Layoffs and stagnant wages have a lot of white-collar workers feeling stuck. Meanwhile, blue-collar industries face a labor shortage. Columnist Callum Borchers explains why it could be time for struggling workers to  think about switching [https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/white-collar-workers-shouldnt-dismiss-a-blue-collar-career-change-32dfa69e] to something more hands-on.

A: Pivoting to an industry outside traditional white-collar havens is an option many professionals don’t consider. That’s even though the jobs are generally less vulnerable to artificial intelligence, the earning potential is often comparable, and the work-life balance is frequently better.

Of course, it takes years to master a trade and make good money at it. Starting in your 30s or 40s leaves a short window before your back and knees give out.

But in a blue-collar job market being reshaped by technology and private equity, there are faster routes to six-figure paychecks than learning a skilled trade—ones that are easier on the joints, too.

For example: Crash Champions, a car-repair chain in 38 states, is hungry for service advisers. The role involves assessing damage, estimating the cost to fix it and overseeing the process. You don’t need to sweat under the hood; you just need to know a lot about cars.

The starting salary is roughly $60,000, but service advisers can double their salaries in 18 months, says Chief Executive Matt Ebert.

After shelling out for college and amassing years of experience, it is natural to fixate on jobs in your one field to justify those investments. Career changes are never easy, but this is no time to let status and labels get in the way of the right long-term move.

China’s playbook for intimidating its rivals ranges from deepfakes to popstar bans.            

Chinese cartoons depicting Taiwan's president and Japan's prime minister.

When Beijing wants to pressure its rivals, it has an extensive—and often menacing—toolbox to draw from. China’s state propaganda machine uses tactics such as AI-generated deepfakes and fake polls to undermine leaders and influence public opinion. The menu for  browbeating countries that cross it [https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-japan-taiwan-strategy-tactics-ab881734] has been on display in the weeks since Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi riled Beijing by saying Japan could get drawn into conflict if China tried to forcibly seize Taiwan.

Everything they need to know about Venezuela they learned on ‘Jack Ryan.’

When Thalia Toha struggled to explain Venezuela’s recent collapse to her daughter, she found the perfect explainer in a 2019 episode of  “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan.” In the clip, John Krasinski’s CIA analyst explains why Venezuela is  the world’s top threat [https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/television/venezuela-maduro-invasion-jack-ryan-76c86584], citing its oil wealth and a corrupt strongman leader who tanked the economy. The scene has since gone viral, prompting fans to question if the show’s creators predicted the future six years before American troops captured Maduro.
