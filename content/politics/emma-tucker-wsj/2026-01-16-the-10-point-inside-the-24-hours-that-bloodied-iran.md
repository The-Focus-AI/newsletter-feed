✏️ When authorities in Iran shut down the internet on Jan. 8, they didn’t just block the world out; they created a vacuum for an  unprecedented wave of state violence [https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/massacre-iran-protests-8731e4cb]. Our latest reporting reconstructs the 24 hours that followed, a period one human-rights group leader describes as a “massacre.” While President Trump said that the killing of protesters had stopped, Iranians said the bloodshed has left a tense pall over many cities.

What happened in Iran when the internet went dark?

Tehran carried out its fierce crackdown under the cover of an internet shutdown and extensive disruption to phone services, so it is hard to judge its true scale. Human-rights groups are trying to assemble a full account of the death toll, compiling evidence that includes images of body bags and testimonies from relatives, medical workers and others. But  eyewitness accounts of localized violence [https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/massacre-iran-protests-8731e4cb] and estimates by rights groups and intelligence services point to bloodshed that far exceeds the toll in previous bouts of protests, whatever the final tally of the dead may be, report Benoit Faucon and Margherita Stancati.

The Powell investigation threatens to upend the final stretch of the Fed chair contest.

The criminal probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is  creating new obstacles [https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/trump-fed-chair-nominee-search-powell-bb5dba1d] on Capitol Hill and raising hard questions about whether any nominee Trump chooses to replace him can be seen as independent—tension that was always present but is now much harder to ignore. Trump has made clear he prizes loyalty in his pick, but the Justice Department investigation—which Powell said was part of a campaign to get the Fed to lower interest rates—threatens to make that quality a liability. The backlash on Capitol Hill could force Trump’s pick to walk a tightrope in any confirmation process this spring, report Nick Timiraos, Siobhan Hughes and Josh Dawsey.

Q: Gen X and Millennials will inherit trillions in real estate over the next decade. What will be the ripple effects of the great wealth transfer?

Baby boomers and older Americans have spent decades amassing one of the largest concentrations of private wealth in history. Now, it is starting to be passed down. Katherine Clarke writes about  the changes it’s bringing [https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/millennial-genx-inherit-real-estate-wealth-d78b4454] to the high-end property market:

A: Over the next decade, roughly 1.2 million individuals with net worths of $5 million or more are projected to pass down more than $38 trillion globally, according to a new report from brokerage Coldwell Banker Global Luxury reviewed exclusively by WSJ.

Real estate is poised to play a significant role in the great wealth transfer. Gen Xers and Millennials are set to inherit $4.6 trillion in global real estate over the next 10 years, according to the report. Nearly $2.4 trillion of that property is located in the U.S.

Real-estate brokers, attorneys and family offices say they are already seeing profound changes in who buys luxury homes and how purchases are structured. High-net-worth families are bringing children into conversations about inheritance earlier and making high-stakes real-estate decisions sooner.

At the high end of the market, agents say more parents aren’t waiting for kids to inherit their wealth; they are buying them luxury properties sooner. It’s reshaping the definition of luxury real estate, as more sellers cater to the tastes and preferences of a younger generation of buyers.

Some heirs are discovering that legacy properties are more than they want to take on. Large estates requiring significant maintenance and full-time staff are increasingly coming to market, brokers say.

Many among the younger generations prefer more contemporary living arrangements or more liquid assets. Higher home prices and higher mortgage rates have also made it impractical for some heirs to buy out their siblings.

          $2.96          

The amount one of our reporters spent on  an “inflation-busting” meal [https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumers/usda-agriculture-secretary-meal-cost-e1bdb4f4] from a grocery store in Boston—comprising 4 ounces of chicken, a cup of broccoli, a tortilla and an ounce of cheese—as suggested by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. An Agriculture Department spokesman said it found thousands of meal combinations that meet its $10-a-day criteria—roughly $3 a meal. WSJ reporters testing the math in Boston and New Orleans found the target doable, but not necessarily very filling.

This chain-smoking rock star made Indiana football hurt so good.

At a time when nobody saw Indiana football as a good investment, he gave $1.5 million to build the team’s practice facility: the John Mellencamp Pavilion. In return, the school gifted Mellencamp a wooden shack atop the stadium where he can watch the games and smoke as much as he wants.
