Police who once backed ICE’s mission are losing faith in its tactics.

As federal immigration agents conduct high-profile operations across the U.S., from “Metro Surge” in Minnesota to “Catch of the Day” in Maine, some local and state  law-enforcement leaders are voicing concerns [https://www.wsj.com/us-news/police-who-once-backed-ices-mission-are-losing-faith-in-its-tactics-e123c348] that these efforts have strayed from the administration’s stated focus on public-safety threats, Jack Morphet and Kris Maher report. Many police leaders say they still support combating illegal immigration and believe the troubling actions stem from a minority of officers, but they say these problems undermine their efforts to put a human face on law enforcement. Federal authorities have defended their tactics.

EXPERT TAKE

Q: Can Trump and Big Pharma get the world to pay more for drugs?

Manufacturers are pushing for higher drug prices overseas. Heard on the Street columnist David Wainer wrote about the  political and economic resistance [https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/can-trump-and-big-pharma-get-the-world-to-pay-more-for-drugs-bfe5e31d] they face.

A: Americans pay about three times what other wealthy nations do for branded prescription drugs. For years, policymakers have tried to fix this by cutting U.S. drug prices directly. President Trump has pushed a different idea: make foreign countries pay more so Americans can pay less.

For Big Pharma, there’s potential upside. But it is easier said than done.

Last year, after threatening the industry with crushing tariffs, Trump secured several commitments. The most important one: Drugmakers agreed to charge the U.S. no more than what other wealthy countries pay for newly launched medicines.

On paper, it makes sense. If American prices are tethered to what the U.K. or Switzerland pays, drugmakers would need to raise prices abroad and lower them in the U.S. to balance things out. But the reality is messier.

What’s clear is that pharmaceutical executives are eager to seize the moment. They have new leverage, including the backing of U.S. trade representatives and the Commerce Department. The U.K. already agreed to increase what it pays for medicines as part of a wider trade deal. Germany and Switzerland are signaling greater openness on the issue as well.

These videos contradict the U.S. account of the Minneapolis shooting.                                            

Federal agents claimed Alex Pretti forced their hand, alleging he “violently resisted” disarmament until officers fired “defensive shots.” Bystander footage appears to  tell a different story [https://www.wsj.com/us-news/videos-contradict-u-s-account-of-minneapolis-shooting-by-federal-agents-fbe1e488]. A frame-by-frame review by WSJ shows an officer pulling a handgun away from Pretti. Less than a second later, an agent fires several rounds. Pretti died at the scene.

HAPPENING THIS WEEK

Tuesday: The Census Bureau is set to release its first set of 2025 figures, which will include national and state population estimates. Trump delivers a speech on the economy and energy in Iowa.

THE NUMBER

          $1 trillion          

The approximate  cost of replacing current U.S. military equipment [https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/europes-1-trillion-race-to-build-back-its-defense-industry-db8ca1d6] and personnel in Europe, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The continent’s once-sclerotic defense industry is churning out drones, tanks, ammunition and other weaponry at its fastest pace in decades as it looks to rearm in the face of Russian aggression and divides with Washington. But there is still some way to go.

AND FINALLY...

China is training its AI-controlled weapons with insights from hawks and coyotes.

As Beijing works to harness AI to deploy swarms of drones, “robot wolves” and other autonomous systems, researchers are  turning to nature for inspiration [https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-ai-weapons-hawks-wolves-2fcb58bb]. After observing how hawks target their prey, engineers at one of China’s top military-linked universities trained defensive drones to single out and destroy the most vulnerable enemy aircraft.
