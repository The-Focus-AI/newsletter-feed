✏️ In a dizzying three weeks on the world stage, President Trump deposed Venezuela’s leader, threatened its neighbors with military action, raised the specter of new strikes on Iran and ignited—then tamped down—a diplomatic crisis with Europe over his efforts to acquire Greenland. At each fresh turn, Congress has found itself scrambling to keep up, sparking new debates among lawmakers about how to  claw back constitutional powers [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/congress-war-powers-trump-96303d36] from the presidency over matters of foreign policy in the Trump era.

The West stepped back from the brink. But Europe’s distrust of America lingers.

The crisis over Greenland, though now defused, already has  many European leaders worrying [https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/trump-greenland-us-europe-trust-0e11c7fa] about long-term damage. Trump’s approach has also prompted leaders in Europe and Canada to focus more on reducing their countries’ economic, technological and military dependence on the U.S., the kind of derisking previously reserved for China and Russia. Some European officials have started seriously worrying about the exposure of their economies to U.S. software, payment systems and communications platforms that could be switched off or disrupted in case of an escalating conflict, reports Yaroslav Trofimov.

Congress can’t claw back war powers from Trump.

Many U.S. lawmakers—Democrats and a small but growing number of Republicans—are  searching for ways [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/congress-war-powers-trump-96303d36] to rein in the president. At stake, they say, is the U.S.-led global order that’s been in place since the end of World War II. So far, these lawmakers concede they are failing. The latest Republican-controlled Congress has accelerated a decadeslong shift giving the White House greater authority to take on America’s adversaries and even some allies, write Robbie Gramer and Lindsay Wise.

Q: How can a ‘raise’ from Social Security result in less take-home pay for retirees?

Nearly six million seniors owe extra Medicare premiums called Irmaa, and these  charges are set to rise [https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/taxes/what-is-irmaa-medicare-social-security-c7e2860a], writes Laura Saunders.

A: The short answer is that rising Medicare premiums ate into their monthly benefit.

Now here’s more: For 2026, Social Security’s inflation adjustment is 2.8%. Despite this “raise,” some seniors will see their monthly benefits shrink.

That’s because Medicare premiums are based on the overall cost of the Medicare program, and its costs and premiums have been rising. These premiums are subtracted from the monthly Social Security payments, so they can reduce a senior’s “take-home” pay.

Nearly six million higher-earning seniors face yet another Medicare charge that affects their Social Security payment. This charge is based on income and is called Irmaa, for “Income related monthly adjustment amount.”

Congress enacted Irmaa to have higher earners pick up a greater portion of their own Medicare costs. Annual Irmaa charges in 2026 for Part B Medicare (for doctors and outpatient care) range from about $974 to about $5,844 per recipient, depending on income.

According to the 2025 Medicare Trustees Report, overall Part B Irmaa charges are expected to increase 30% from 2026 to 2030–so Irmaa’s bite will likely grow as well.

Using Anthropic’s Claude Code, two WSJ columnists with no formal programming background vibe coded  this article [https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-claude-vibe-coding-experiment-a4a3bb0f]—chat bubbles, Easter eggs and all.

The results are wondrous and unsettling: People without a lick of coding experience are building things that once required trained software developers.
