This is an edition of the WSJ Weekend Reads newsletter, a weekly look at our most colorful, thought-provoking and original feature stories on the business of life. If you’re not subscribed, sign up here.

 

America First is starting to look more like America Alone.

 

U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere are becoming increasingly disenchanted as President Trump continues his insults and threats.

 

This week we look at how that’s playing out and how some allies are now seeking out alternatives to America when it comes to trade and other things. It all has long-term repercussions for everyone.

 

Other topics we delve into include toxic mom groups, bigger tax refunds and what happens when you stop taking Ozempic. And don’t forget to test your cultural IQ.

 

Enjoy your weekend with these and all the great reads below.
