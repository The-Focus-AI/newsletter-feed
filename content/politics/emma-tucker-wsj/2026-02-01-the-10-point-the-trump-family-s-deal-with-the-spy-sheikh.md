✏️ The “spy sheikh” wanted access to AI hardware. After a deal with the Trump family, he got it. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, an Abu Dhabi royal, was linked to a United Arab Emirates firm that  secretly made a half-billion-dollar investment [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/spy-sheikh-secret-stake-trump-crypto-tahnoon-ea4d97e8] in the Trumps’ crypto company, WSJ reports for the first time. The deal came just months before the U.A.E. won access to tightly guarded American AI chips.

A firm tied to the “spy sheikh” secretly bought a stake in a Trump company.

Prior to the president’s inauguration last year, lieutenants to an Abu Dhabi royal  signed a deal with the Trump family [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/spy-sheikh-secret-stake-trump-crypto-tahnoon-ea4d97e8] to buy a 49% stake in their crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, for $500 million, report Sam Kessler, Rebecca Ballhaus, Eliot Brown and Angus Berwick. The purchase was linked to the U.A.E. president's brother, who was pushing the U.S. for access to tightly guarded AI chips. A few months after the deal was signed, the U.A.E. won that access. The deal, which steered $187 million to Trump family entities, also marked something unprecedented in U.S. politics: a foreign government-linked entity taking a major ownership stake in an incoming president’s company.

The silver market is messed up, and these buyers are feeling the pain.

The boom in prices for the metal—which was interrupted by Friday’s plunge—has fueled a frenzy among refiners and caused pain for companies that need it, report Rebecca Feng and Joe Wallace. Manufacturers that rely on silver have been stung. It is a critical component in solar cells, and the world’s largest solar-panel makers saw profitability plunge as prices surged. Industrial users are  looking to minimize their silver use [https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/the-silver-market-is-messed-up-these-buyers-are-feeling-the-pain-8ab7f954], which could help reverse the rally. Eventually, refiners might process enough scrap to bring prices down.

Q: Trump’s “armada” is on Iran’s doorstep. Why hasn’t he used it yet?

U.S. military assets have arrived in the Middle East, headed by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier battle group. Reporters Lara Seligman, Shelby Holliday and Michael R. Gordon wrote about  why the Pentagon is waiting [https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/before-any-strike-on-iran-u-s-needs-to-bolster-air-defenses-in-mideast-faca35a9] before making a move.

A: Trump has yet to say whether and how he might use force against Iran. But American airstrikes aren’t imminent, U.S. officials say, because the Pentagon is moving in additional air defenses to better protect Israel, Arab allies and American forces in the event of a retaliation by Tehran and a potential prolonged conflict.

The U.S. military could conduct limited airstrikes on Iran if the president were to order an attack today, U.S. officials say. But the kind of decisive attack that Trump has asked the military to prepare would likely prompt a proportional response from Iran, requiring the U.S. to have robust air defenses in place to protect Israel as well as American troops, the officials say.

The military already has air defenses in the region, including destroyers capable of shooting down aerial threats. But the Pentagon is deploying an additional Thaad battery and Patriot air defenses to bases where U.S. troops are stationed across the Middle East, including Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, according to defense officials, flight tracking data and satellite imagery.

Thaads can intercept ballistic missiles above the Earth’s atmosphere, while Patriots defend against lower-altitude, shorter-range threats.

U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East, declined to comment.

The expected  shortage of workers [https://www.wsj.com/business/telecom/high-speed-internet-boom-hits-low-tech-snag-a-labor-shortage-9c92b514] in fiber-optic cable installation by 2032, according to a 2024 report by the Fiber Broadband Association and the Power & Communication Contractors Association. Demand for these workers is soaring thanks in part to tech companies’ appetite for data centers. But despite rising wages, the rush to build is hitting a human bottleneck. As a result, contractors and analysts predict that our AI future might take longer to achieve and that a goal of nationwide high-speed internet could remain out of reach.

Tourists in Japan are baffled by the scarcity of trash cans.

The country has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the cleanest places in the world, despite having  almost no public trash cans [https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/travel/tourists-in-japan-are-baffled-where-are-the-trash-cans-8d0202b7]. But an influx of foreign visitors is disrupting the garbage equilibrium. Littering is on the rise in some tourist-heavy areas, leading some officials to rethink waste management. Some visitors have started stashing trash in their pockets and bags.
