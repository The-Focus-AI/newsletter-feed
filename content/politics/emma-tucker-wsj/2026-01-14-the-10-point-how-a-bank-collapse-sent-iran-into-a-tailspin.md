✏️ The biggest harbinger that Iran was about to unravel didn’t come from the thwarted anger of the country’s opposition or the frustrated hopes of its youth. It came from  a bank failure [https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/bank-collapse-iran-protests-83f6b681]. The collapse of Ayandeh Bank exposed a financial system hollowed out by cronyism and a currency in a tailspin. With President Trump signaling that “help is on the way”  for protesting Iranians [https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/trump-cancels-meetings-with-iran-over-killing-of-protesters-0973aa84], we explain the economic crisis behind this uprising and what a U.S. intervention could look like.

An obscure bank collapse sent Iran into a tailspin.

Late last year, Ayandeh Bank, run by regime cronies and saddled with nearly $5 billion in losses on a pile of bad loans, went bust. The crisis hit  at the worst possible time [https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/bank-collapse-iran-protests-83f6b681]. The Iranian government’s credibility had already been battered by a 12-day war with Israel and the U.S. in June that showed it couldn’t defend its population from attack. The bank’s failure became both a symbol and an accelerant of an economic unraveling that triggered the protests now posing the most significant threat to the regime since the founding of the Islamic Republic half a century ago, reports Jared Malsin.

The U.S. has blown up China’s Latin America ambitions.

The removal of Nicolás Maduro is forcing Beijing into  a high-stakes recalculation [https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/china-trump-venezuela-maduro-75e95551] of its ambitions. For years, China made inroads into Latin America, coaxing countries to abandon support for Taiwan with loans to build roads, ports and rail lines, making significant purchases of commodities, and mining crucial metals such as copper. Venezuela's strongman was its most important ally, an anti-American leader with oil resources. Now, Beijing is no longer seeking to make new advances into the region in the near term, reports Lingling Wei.

Q: What would a 10% credit-card rate cap mean for your wallet?

Trump’s call for a temporary 10% cap on credit-card interest rates promises to save Americans billions in interest but also could lead to tightened access to credit. Reporter Veronica Dagher explains what a cap  might mean for your money [https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/credit/what-a-10-credit-card-rate-cap-would-mean-for-your-wallet-365f2f8d]:

A: The president didn’t offer any details on how the one-year cap would be enacted but said he wanted it to begin on Jan. 20.

Credit-card issuers are already pushing back, saying it will only hurt the people it is intended to help.

Credit-card interest rates average around 23% and haven’t been below 10% in data going back to 1994. People with lower credit scores can pay rates of up to 36%.

A 10% cap could save American households roughly $100 billion a year in interest payments, according to Vanderbilt University. That could translate to meaningful savings for Americans.

Trump didn’t say whether his cap would apply to new or existing balances. Other rate-cap proposals have focused more on new balances.

The card industry warns that many people, especially those with lower incomes and lower credit scores, would lose access to credit cards. One industry estimate said close to 90% of cardholders could lose access to credit, either through account closures or reduced credit lines.

Credit-card lending would become a lot less profitable, and issuers would likely make  their rewards programs [https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/credit/how-trumps-cap-on-credit-card-rates-would-reshape-the-rewards-world-c662002e] a lot less generous. Cards issuers could also introduce new annual fees or increase existing ones.

It isn’t clear how Trump would enforce a cap. Most legal experts say that the president can’t unilaterally cap interest rates by executive order and that such a cap would require an act of Congress.
