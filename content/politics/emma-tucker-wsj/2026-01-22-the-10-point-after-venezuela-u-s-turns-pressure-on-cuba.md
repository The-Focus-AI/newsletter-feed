✏️ When President Trump arrived in Davos yesterday afternoon, European leaders were panicking that his push to acquire Greenland would trigger a trans-Atlantic conflagration.

In Greenland, anxiety over U.S. ambitions puts normal life on pause.

Trump, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, yesterday, said he wouldn’t deploy the military to take control of the territory. But his assurances  did little to calm the nerves [https://www.wsj.com/world/in-greenland-anxiety-over-u-s-ambitions-puts-normal-life-on-pause-36224449] of its residents. Through it all, many have felt like pawns in a global game that has upended their politics. Before Trump renewed his bid to take over, the debate wasn’t if—but when—Greenland would become independent from Denmark. Now that process is on hold as the island tries to ride out the political storm, reports Drew Hinshaw.

The U.S. is actively seeking a regime change in Cuba by the end of the year.

Emboldened by the ouster of Venezuela’s president, the Trump administration is searching for Cuban government insiders who can help cut a deal to  push out the Communist regime [https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/the-u-s-is-actively-seeking-regime-change-in-cuba-by-the-end-of-the-year-1d0f178a] by the end of the year, people familiar with the matter said. The administration has assessed Cuba’s economy as being close to collapse and that the government has never been this fragile. Officials don’t have a concrete plan to end the Communist government, but they see Maduro’s capture and subsequent concessions from his allies left behind as a blueprint and a warning for Cuba, report José de Córdoba, Vera Bergengruen and Deborah Acosta.

Q: What’s the best airline to fly?

WSJ ranked  nine major U.S. airlines [https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/travel/the-best-and-worst-airlines-of-2025-e69b41c7] on seven operations metrics including flight cancellations and on-time arrivals. The winner has spent billions improving operations—while navigating a corporate shake-up and revamping its strategy, write Dawn Gilbertson and Allison Pohle.

A: Southwest Airlines took first place in the Journal’s 18th annual airline scorecard for the first time since 2020. The nation’s largest domestic carrier by passengers won by a wide margin, ending Delta’s four-year winning streak.

Budget carrier Allegiant came in second, followed by Delta in third. In our ratings basement: American and Frontier, which tied for last place. It was a return trip for Frontier.

Southwest didn’t best rivals in every category but had high showings across the board. It had the fewest customer complaints and delays, and was second best in on-time arrivals and the rate of canceled flights. Its worst finish was fourth, for baggage handling.

Despite industry challenges and sweeping internal changes, its operation hummed. The airline, which long eschewed layoffs, cut its corporate workforce by 15%. It started red-eye flights to get more use out of its planes and began charging for checked bags and saw the volume of carry-on bags surge.

Overall, airlines performed about the same as they did the prior year. The industry averages for cancellations, bags lost and bumping were essentially flat compared with 2024.

Here’s how Canada pulled off the sexiest show of the year.

Executives at Bell Media were hunting for their own version of Netflix’s “Bridgerton” when they received a script about rival pro-hockey players in a secret romance. Other companies might have balked, but the script came from one of their most trusted showrunners, so Bell seized it.  Their bet on “Heated Rivalry” paid off [https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/television/heated-rivalry-bell-media-canada-jacob-tierney-156701dd]. The series has become the Canadian media company’s most successful original series of the streaming era—despite being solo-financed and launched with minimal promotion.
