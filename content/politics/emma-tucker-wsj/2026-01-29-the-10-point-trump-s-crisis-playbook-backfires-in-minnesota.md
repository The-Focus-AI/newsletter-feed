✏️ After the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, President Trump’s advisers followed their boss’s playbook  for moments of crisis [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-and-his-team-have-a-well-worn-crisis-playbook-it-backfired-in-minnesota-c0849e4f]: Cede no ground, never admit mistakes and attack. But this time the strategy backfired. Now, the president and his aides are rushing to limit the political damage, pointing fingers and shifting their strategy as they go. The killing has shaken the nation—and provoked a clash in the White House over the future of Trump’s immigration policy. And for Gregory Bovino, the operation that was  supposed to be his biggest yet [https://www.wsj.com/us-news/bovion-ice-border-patrol-minneapolis-3b803543] led to his dramatic fall.

Trump’s border chief was a rising star. Then he arrived in Minneapolis.

For six months, Gregory Bovino was the face of rolling immigration raids that netted thousands of arrests. His Minnesota campaign, “Operation Metro Surge,” was supposed to be  his most ambitious mission [https://www.wsj.com/us-news/bovion-ice-border-patrol-minneapolis-3b803543] yet. Instead, it descended into scenes of tear gas, pepper spray and civil unrest. Less than 48 hours after referring to border agents who killed Pretti as “victims,” Bovino was pulled from the field. With his removal, some are anticipating an end to the maximalist enforcement strategy he championed, report Joshua Chaffin and Michelle Hackman.

A battered Iran is still able to mount a deadly response to U.S. strikes.

Israel pounded Iran’s military in June’s war, but the regime emerged from the bruising conflict with much of its arsenal of thousands of ballistic missiles intact, which gives it the ability to  inflict real damage [https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/a-battered-iran-is-still-able-to-mount-a-deadly-response-to-u-s-strikes-6331080f] on the U.S. and its allies. Tehran’s arsenal gives it the potential to hit targets around the Middle East, meaning any attack by the U.S. could quickly escalate despite Trump’s preference for decisive use of force that doesn’t turn into a regional conflict, report Laurence Norman and Dov Lieber.

Q: Why is the dollar sliding?

The currency’s drop has  renewed fears [https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/what-the-slide-in-the-dollar-means-for-trade-travel-and-investment-ef02816d] that America’s pre-eminent position in global markets is waning, write David Uberti and Chelsey Dulaney.

A: The dollar’s strength over the past decade was propelled in large part by “American exceptionalism,” or the outperformance of the U.S. economy and markets compared with the rest of the world. Political stability and strong rule of law gave overseas investors extra reason to snap up U.S. assets.

Both sources of support are weakening somewhat.

While economists have dialed up U.S. growth projections, stimulative economic policies in Japan, Germany and elsewhere have helped overseas stock markets in recent months outperform their counterparts stateside. At the same time, even after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady yesterday, many on Wall Street expect the central bank to resume easing policy in 2026, as Trump has advocated.

More cuts could narrow the premium that U.S. Treasury yields offer relative to government debt in other countries, drawing investors elsewhere to help shield themselves from the risk of owning U.S. assets like stocks.

That is why much of Wall Street is betting on more dollar weakness to come, potentially ending a yearslong run in which the currency enticed investors the world over to park more money in America.

A weaker dollar has  always been part [https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/a-weaker-dollar-has-always-been-part-of-trumps-plan-733c9adc] of Trump’s plan, says Greg Ip.

When Flor Mora closed on her new home for $4 million in November 2025, she knew she was acquiring a piece of California history. What she didn’t realize was that she was also buying the  future WSJ House of the Year [https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/house-of-the-year-storybook-home-carmel-highlands-california-2a683348]. The M.J. Murphy-designed home, built in 1925 and located in Carmel Highlands, is an example of early 20th-century Storybook architecture. The style is synonymous with the neighboring city of Carmel-by-the-Sea, which is known for its fairy tale aesthetic.

Everybody is suddenly obsessed with 2016.

A severe bout of nostalgia is spreading in America, but it’s not for the postwar prosperity of the 1950s or the big hair and bright colors of the ’80s. Young adults are  yearning for the simple days [https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/2016-instagram-tiktok-drake-rihanna-907e8e05] of 2016. For weeks, social-media feeds have been littered with decade-old images of Snapchat filters and skinny jeans. The internet obsession is spilling into real life: The top musical artists of that year are enjoying a new surge in popularity and clubs are hosting 2016-themed parties.
