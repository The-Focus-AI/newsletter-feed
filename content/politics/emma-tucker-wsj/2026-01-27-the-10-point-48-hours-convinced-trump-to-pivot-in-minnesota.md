✏️ President Trump is changing course in Minnesota after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti. By Monday, Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino was leaving the state and Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, was en route to Minneapolis to take charge. The president’s pivot came after Republican lawmakers and other allies raised concerns that he was squandering public support for his signature campaign issue and senior administration officials increasingly saw the chaotic scenes in Minneapolis as a political liability. Our reporters go  inside the 48 hours [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/the-48-hours-that-convinced-trump-to-change-course-in-minnesota-a91d7683] that convinced the president to de-escalate.

As Minneapolis videos splashed across the news, Trump was watching.

Working from the Oval Office as a winter storm barreled toward Washington, D.C., the president was paying attention as footage of a federal immigration agent shooting Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive-care nurse and U.S. citizen, played on repeat. Roughly 48 hours after the shooting, he  moved to pull back [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/the-48-hours-that-convinced-trump-to-change-course-in-minnesota-a91d7683] one of his administration’s most high-profile and divisive immigration-enforcement campaigns. In the process, Trump appeared to take sides—for now—in a simmering debate that has been playing out quietly in the administration, report Annie Linskey, Alex Leary and Michelle Hackman.

Trump is making a high-stakes bid to dole out $100 billion more in tax refunds.

The annual tax-filing season that opened yesterday will produce a cash surge estimated at $100 billion beyond last year’s $329 billion total, and it is engineered to buoy Republicans’ sagging voter approval. At stake is whether Republicans can retain narrow House and Senate majorities that give them the authority to control the federal agenda. The  tax-policy strategy [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/tax-season-refunds-republicans-1d4aac5d] is simple: Put money in voters’ wallets and get rewarded at the polls. In reality, it is a double-bank shot with little guarantee of success, reports Richard Rubin.

EXPERT TAKE

Q: How does the federal investigation of Alex Pretti’s death differ from past cases?

The Department of Homeland Security is leading an investigation into the killing of Pretti by a Border Patrol agent, amid objections from Minnesota officials who say they are being shut out. Justice Department reporter Sadie Gurman explains  the state of play. [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/how-the-federal-investigation-of-alex-prettis-death-differs-from-past-cases-47777b6a]

A: U.S. officials said Homeland Security Investigations, an agency within DHS, is leading the probe, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation serving in an assisting role. Usually, the FBI takes the lead.

HSI agents have the authority to arrest people if they have probable cause. But any potential prosecution would have to be handled by the Justice Department.

Most shootings by officers involve local police, rather than federal agents. Federal authorities work alongside local investigators to determine whether an officer engaged in obstruction of justice or violated someone’s civil rights.

The Justice Department typically reviews any shooting involving a federal agent. What’s more, the FBI and DOJ normally investigate almost every high-profile officer-involved killing because prosecutors consider them incidents of national significance that warrant such inquiries.

Minnesota officials want to conduct detailed investigations in the killings of Pretti and Renee Good, who was shot in her car by an agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But they say federal authorities are interfering with their sovereign right to investigate possible violations of state law.

The Trump administration says the state has no legal right to information in what were federal incidents. Both sides have said they don’t trust each other to conduct a fair investigation.

Iranian authorities have acknowledged more than 3,100 fatalities, blaming them on rioters and terrorists they say infiltrated the protests.
