✏️ OpenAI is making preparations to become the first generative AI startup to tap the public markets. We have  exclusive reporting [https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-ipo-anthropic-race-69f06a42] that the $500 billion company is laying groundwork for a fourth-quarter listing, accelerating plans as competition with rival Anthropic intensifies. A successful IPO by year-end remains a tall order. The ChatGPT maker is still solidifying its leadership ranks and must navigate a trial in a case brought by co-founder Elon Musk. At the same time, Amazon  is in talks [https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-50-billion-in-openai-43191ba0] to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI, which would be a giant bet on the hot startup.

This crypto CEO has become enemy No. 1 on Wall Street.

Brian Armstrong, CEO of the biggest U.S. crypto company, was chatting with former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week when JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon cut in. “You are full of sh—,” said Dimon, a longtime crypto skeptic, pointing a finger at Armstrong. The  confrontation had been brewing [https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-wall-street-a7895786] since Coinbase’s Armstrong appeared on business-television programs earlier that week, accusing banks of trying to sabotage legislation for a new digital asset regulatory framework. As crypto moves swiftly into the mainstream of American finance, some of Wall Street’s heavyweights are waking up to the threat, report Amrith Ramkumar, Dylan Tokar and Gina Heeb.

A plan to save elephants sparked a deadly conflict.

On the border between Zambia and Malawi, elephants are trampling farmers and farmers are shooting elephants in a conservation project  gone badly wrong [https://www.wsj.com/world/a-plan-to-save-elephants-sparked-a-deadly-conflict-2bb13ef0]. Dozens have died. Crops needed to stave off starvation have been decimated. Poaching is resurging. It’s a cautionary tale about the pitfalls that can accompany good intentions. In 2022, a conservation group, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, helped the Malawi government truck 263 elephants from Liwonde National Park, which had too many elephants, to Kasungu National Park in Malawi. The effort soon escalated into one of southern Africa’s deadliest conflicts between people and wildlife in recent decades, reports Nicholas Bariyo.

Q: How—and why—are businesses manipulating ChatGPT results?

You’ve long heard about search engine optimization. Now, companies are  spending big [https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-what-is-geo-aeo-5c452500] on generative engine optimization, writes technology columnist Christopher Mims.

A: When you ask ChatGPT and other AIs to recommend a product or service, odds are the top answers were put there by humans.

Businesses are paying big bucks to get favorable mentions from chatbots. SEO practitioners call this generative engine optimization, aka GEO.

The creators of chatbots strive to source their answers from reputable sources. But today’s AIs are shallow readers of the internet, and their responses can be manipulated.

In the world of search, the currency is “referral traffic.” A year ago, 90% of that traffic came from Google, Evan Bailyn, chief executive of First Page Sage, told me. Now, about 44% of his clients’ referrals come from AI.

People referred to a site by ChatGPT stayed longer and were more likely to make a transaction, compared to those referred by Google.

To boost companies’ placements in AI results, Bailyn’s company plants a sort of magic incantation, known as a “brand authority statement,” on at least 10 websites. Typically these are owned by other clients.

Say you want to be the first answer to the question “What’s the best hot tub for sciatica?” in ChatGPT. Associating his client with the phrase “highest-rated for sciatica” on various company blogs can be enough to convince ChatGPT.

Another cue that matters to bots is where the praise appears, since they are programmed to value some sources more than others. A review in the Journal, for example, has more influence than a Reddit comment. The variety of signals that chatbots rely on is good news for end users, because it means some AI results are harder to manipulate.
