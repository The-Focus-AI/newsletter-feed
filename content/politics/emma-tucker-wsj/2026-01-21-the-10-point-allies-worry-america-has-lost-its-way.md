Trump’s Greenland strategy draws from a familiar playbook.

European leaders have for months responded to the president’s desire to acquire Greenland with a simple refrain: It isn’t for sale. Now, those same leaders are rushing to set up meetings with him about the future of the territory after he threatened to bludgeon Europe’s economy with stiff tariffs.The shift is the result of  an established strategy [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trumps-greenland-strategy-draws-from-familiar-playbook-966b5ae9] for Trump: make audacious demands, threaten economic or military consequences if those demands aren’t met—then wait for his opponents to bend, report Meridith McGraw and Natalie Andrews.

Escalating tensions over Greenland are  supercharging a shift [https://www.wsj.com/economy/global/united-states-investment-trade-08e76e85] away from a U.S.-centered global economy, as Trump’s combative policies compel countries to seek new trade alliances and invest elsewhere.

Chinese electric vehicles are blowing past Tesla and tariffs en route to global reign.

Not long ago, few would buy the idea that a Chinese EV maker such as BYD could sweep European buyers off their feet. Yet the company is leading a pack of Chinese automakers whose global export  onslaught has surpassed [https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/china-cars-tariffs-byd-tesla-fa18066f] even bullish expectations. BYD, which replaced Tesla as the world’s biggest EV seller, delivered more than a million vehicles outside China in 2025, more than double the previous year’s total, report Stephen Wilmot and Santiago Pérez.

Q: Why does Trump want Greenland?

Reporter Georgi Kantchev explains why the president has  doubled down on his campaign [https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/greenland-trump-tariffs-trade-eu/card/why-does-trump-want-greenland--bg2pXoowsTJl4jmXgGtX] to acquire the island:

A: In Greenland, Trump has set his sights on a vast, ice-covered and sparsely populated island with a strategic location on the edge of the Arctic.

It has ample deposits in rare earths, oil and gas and its commanding position astride crucial trade and military arteries has made it a focal point for rival major powers.

Russia and China have been beefing up their activities in the region in recent years and Trump has said that Greenland is important to his plans to implement a “Golden Dome” missile-defense plan.

His aspiration also aligns with his desire to establish U.S. hegemony over the Western Hemisphere, an idea dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine.” Control over Greenland and the broader Arctic is valuable for projecting power, monitoring activities of rivals and securing shipping routes.

But extracting these minerals isn’t easy. Mining companies operating there contend with high costs, sparse infrastructure and hostile weather.

In southwestern Montana, near Yellowstone National Park, is Big Sky, a mountain community that emerged around 1973 with the opening of remote ski area. Over time, Big Sky  has transformed [https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/big-sky-montana-real-estate-ea874f07] from a scattering of residences and businesses into a true town and a destination for wealthy ski-home buyers. The median listing price is $3.05 million as of December 2025. Despite this growth, the community keeps an authentic Montana feel: Dressing up still means putting on cowboy boots, jeans and, maybe, a cowboy hat.

The amount New Hampshire state legislators are  paid per year [https://www.wsj.com/us-news/new-hampshire-lawmakers-are-tired-of-getting-paid-like-its-1889-82c211f4] since voters etched it into the state constitution in 1889. Granite State lawmakers are the lowest paid in the U.S.; their counterparts in most states have salaries of around $47,900. Many past bids to boost pay for NH lawmakers by amending the constitution failed. Now, there is a bipartisan push to delete the pay language from the foundational document.
