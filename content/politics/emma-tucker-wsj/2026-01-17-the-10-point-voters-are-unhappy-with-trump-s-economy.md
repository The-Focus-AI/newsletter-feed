✏️ Donald Trump is pushing boundaries at home and abroad this month, threatening to upend governments in Latin America, take military action in Iran and seize control of Greenland. Some officials have privately nicknamed him “President of the World.” But what do Americans think about  their emboldened president [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/over-two-weeks-in-january-a-boundary-pushing-president-on-full-display-4debdbc8]? A new WSJ poll shows that most U.S.  voters think he’s going too far [https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-approval-rating-economy-poll-b3a62e57]—though members of the MAGA base remain steadfast in their support.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is running out of road.

The recent protests have posed one of the most serious threats yet to the Islamic Republic’s nearly five-decade rule. Iran can now only fix the economic problems underpinning the public anger if it gets relief from international sanctions, which would require Khamenei to  compromise on Iran’s nuclear program [https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/iran-supreme-leader-ali-khamenei-positions-cd1582e1] and other deeply held beliefs, reports Sune Engel Rasmussen. Iran’s economic crisis has deepened at the worst possible time for Khamenei. Since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, Iran’s allies Hezbollah and Hamas have been weakened, and Israeli and U.S. bombings last year exposed Tehran’s vulnerability.

The global memory-chip shortage will cost us all.

Just three companies make more than 90% of these chips, which are fast-appreciating assets: SK Hynix, Samsung and Micron. Prices for memory shot up 50% in the last quarter of 2025 and are projected to increase another 40% to 50% by the end of the first quarter of 2026, according to Counterpoint Research. As AI firms crowd out other buyers,  unexpected consequences will likely reverberate [https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/memory-ram-shortage-2026-f55324b0] across industries, writes Christopher Mims. Effects could include delayed data centers, higher prices for consumer electronics, and possible chip shortages for automakers that could trigger a repeat of the pandemic car crisis.

EXPERT TAKE

Q: Supersize CEO pay packages have taken off. Are they paying off for shareholders?

In recent years, companies have dangled nine-figure “moonshot” pay packages to motivate executives. WSJ’s Theo Francis wrote about what the data say about the  effectiveness of this compensation strategy [https://www.wsj.com/business/ceo-pay-package-issues-f8fc7175].

A: Promising CEOs the moon hasn’t been a great way to get out-of-this-world results.

Dozens of companies—including KKR, Rivian Automotive, Roblox and Robinhood Markets—hammered out $100-million-plus “moonshot” pay packages with their chiefs in the years after Tesla awarded billions of dollars in stock options to Elon Musk in 2018. The potential for huge payoffs was meant to spur outsize returns.

So far, few of the CEOs have managed to deliver, a new analysis has found.

Shareholder returns trailed the S&P 500 at three-quarters of the 20 companies crafting such pay packages for their chief executive officers in 2020 and 2021, at the peak of the trend. Half of the CEOs forfeited much or all of their stock awards. Four, including the private-equity firm KKR’s co-CEOs, have met all their targets for awards recently valued at a combined $2.6 billion. Where the meter is still running, CEOs have earned only about a quarter of the total, on average.

The 2025 inflation numbers are finally in—see the good and bad news.            

SOURCE: LABOR DEPARTMENT

Inflation decelerated over the course of the year, from 2.9% year-over-year in December 2024 to 2.7% last month. In a few categories, like gasoline, cellphone service and tickets to sporting events, prices actually fell. Yet consumers remain frustrated that  they haven’t seen more relief [https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumers/inflation-price-changes-2025-charts-a8deee40]. Grocery prices are among Americans’ biggest gripes, with food-at-home prices up 2.4% from a year earlier in December, an acceleration from 2024’s increase of 1.8%.
