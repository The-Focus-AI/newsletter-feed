This is an edition of the WSJ Weekend Reads newsletter, a weekly look at our most colorful, thought-provoking and original feature stories on the business of life. If you’re not subscribed, sign up here.

 

2025 was a crazy year for air travel. Our plans were roiled by delays or cancellations due to a government shutdown, a shortage of air-traffic controllers and no shortage of bad weather.

 

Some carriers handled it all better than others. In our 18th annual ranking, the WSJ looks at how airlines fared when it came to things like customer complaints, tarmac delays, on-time arrivals and lost luggage.

 

This week we also look at the No-Buy January trend, how AI can help with your email and why pop culture no longer unites us.

 

Enjoy your weekend with these and all the great reads below.
