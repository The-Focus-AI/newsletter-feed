Good morning from New Jersey where I’m constantly freezing 🥶 and sadly no longer cruising around in my new favorite EV. This week’s Big Thing: my test drive of the Xiaomi SU7 and how I managed to fall in love with a Chinese car that isn’t sold in America. 🇨🇳 Then, Apple’s new AirTags, Waymo’s recent crash and Nothing’s rebellion against the yearly phone upgrade. Plus: Google Chrome’s new AI tricks.

The Big Thing

Contrary to what some readers of my current column seem to think, I am neither a communist nor a Chinese spy. Of course, if I were, I probably wouldn’t admit it. 🤔

In December, I test drove a Chinese EV right here in the tri-state area. Chinese EVs aren’t sold in the U.S. but a friend generously loaned me his Xiaomi SU7 Max, which he’d legally brought into the country for a limited time.

As you’ll read in the column [https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/chinese-ev-test-drive-xiaomi-su7-c3e59282?mod=hp_lead_pos9], I fell hard for the whole vehicle: the big beautiful infotainment display, the smooth software, the extended battery range, the Xiaomi gadgets that all connect seamlessly to the car. It’s a high-end EV experience for a not-high-end price. In China, launch pricing started at 299,900 yuan—roughly $43,000.

What’s so striking about driving the Xiaomi is how clearly you can see where Chinese EV makers have vaulted ahead on the digital-first experience. Outside of companies that build the full hardware-and-software stack—Tesla and Rivian being the obvious U.S. examples—very little here feels comparable. Ford and GM know this, which is why they’ve been rebuilding platforms and software architectures from the ground up.

People who don’t read the column to the end might think I am advocating for China to waltz in and wipe out Detroit. I would rather see American automakers accelerate their own EV programs. Also, as I said in my piece, President Trump recently welcomed Chinese automakers to come and build cars in the U.S. using American factories and workers.

It seems clear to me that Chinese EVs have paved a new road. It may be closed to Americans right now—but not forever. And appreciating that reality doesn’t require a membership card to the Chinese Communist Party.

                                           More Things                 1.

New AirTags 🌐📍

“Everyone! Shh! I can’t hear my keys.” That’s me every time I’m trying to hear the gentle chirp of an AirTag while hunting for my keychain. But not for long. Apple is launching a  second generation of its tiny tracking devices [https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/apple-introduces-new-airtag-with-expanded-range-and-improved-findability/], with a speaker that’s 50% louder! The company says it has improved Bluetooth tracking, too. The AirTags are now on sale for the same price as their predecessors—$29 for a single tag or $99 for a four-pack.

Nothing Doing 🔂📵

I’m proud of Nothing for doing…nothing. The hardware company known as Nothing—which makes a phone called Phone— announced in a video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCtmLIGFBSc] that it won’t release a Phone 4 this year, but instead keep last year’s Phone 3 as its flagship. The move marks a deliberate rejection of the upgrade cycle, that annual dance where hardware makers (ahem, Apple) drop flashy new models, often with only incremental improvements. Nothing plans to launch a lower-cost, mid-tier option this year instead.

Robotaxi Rumpus 🚕⚠️

Just as the autonomous taxi industry was pulling into the fast lane, it appears to be hitting some potholes. In Southern California, federal officials are investigating an incident where a  Waymo robotaxi struck a child [https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/waymo-robotaxi-hits-child-near-elementary-school-prompting-nhtsa-investigation-efc1699d] near a school. Waymo said the vehicle likely performed  better than a human [https://waymo.com/blog/2026/01/a-commitment-to-transparency-and-road-safety] would have. (The car quickly slowed to less than 6 miles per hour.)

Meanwhile, San Francisco authorities are investigating a collision between a  Zoox autonomous vehicle and a parked car [https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/san-francisco-police-department-investigating-zoox-collision-with-a-parked-car/]. As I said in our year-ahead column, the more autonomous cars hit the road, the more we will hear of these incidents.

A Thing to Try: Chrome’s Gemini Sidebar

Google rolled out new AI updates to Chrome this week, including a Gemini side panel. Like the AI sidebars already in Microsoft Edge or Perplexity’s Comet browser, it lives on the right rail of the page and lets you ask questions about whatever page you’re on.

The big difference: Chrome is deeply wired into Gmail and the rest of Google’s ecosystem. I asked it to draft an email to the author of the article I was reading, telling her that I didn’t like her story. I could even click Send without leaving the page.

I did have a bit of trouble with it: I went to a Cub Scouts events page and asked it to pull dates and add them to my Google calendar. It failed.

The panel also lets you have fun with website images using Nano Banana. I wanted a penguin on the hood of that car and—sure enough—I got my penguin. A big old emperor, just chilling. Luckily, it’s still cold outside.

These features are rolling out first to  AI Pro and Ultra subscribers [https://gemini.google/subscriptions/] in the U.S.

Throwback Thing                 Who?

Markus Wepfer from Basel, Switzerland

What?

Snake (via a new Nokia Flip model from HMD)

When?

The game was first released in 1997

Why?

Back in the 1990s, I loved my Nokia phone. Way before the smartphone age, it was usable for phone calls and text messaging. It also had a basic calendar, calculator, contact list and my favorite feature: Snake. Using the keypad, you could navigate the snake to find the food, marked by a dot. When it ate the food, the snake extended. The game ended when you crashed into the snake’s body. Similar phones are still being produced today, now by HMD, which licenses the Nokia brand name. As I am a nostalgic person, I bought one of the new phones and, more than 30 years later, I admit I still love the game.
