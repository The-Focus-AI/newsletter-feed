✏️ The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady when it concludes a two-day meeting this afternoon—a decision that is likely to  draw fresh criticism [https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/trump-federal-reserve-picks-68a01177] from President Trump, who has declared inflation defeated. The president has said for months that he’s made up his mind about who should lead the central bank but, as the Journal’s Nick Timiraos and Meridith McGraw write, he wants something that may not exist: a new chair who will pursue his demands for lower rates while commanding enough Wall Street credibility to deliver them.

None of the finalists to run the Fed are exactly what Trump wants.

With each passing week without an announcement on a new central-bank leader, some people close to the process aren’t sure  any of Trump’s four finalists [https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/trump-federal-reserve-picks-68a01177] fully meet his requirements. Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, is the candidate Trump knows best and the one most aligned with his economic agenda. But naming his own adviser to the role could invite questions about Fed independence that some analysts have said could spook the bond market.

A deflation doom loop is trapping China’s economy.

The country’s consumers aren’t spending enough and producers are making too much. That leaves companies all along the supply chain earning less. With less money on hand, businesses are limiting wage growth, pausing hiring and shedding employees, which means workers aren’t spending as much,  continuing the vicious cycle [https://www.wsj.com/world/china/deflation-doom-loop-china-economy-25b0938a]. China managed to keep overall economic growth steady last year thanks to robust exports. But its relentless pursuit of growth through manufacturing has also created a lopsided economy, with much of it stuck in a deflationary spiral, reports Hannah Miao.

Q: What happens when you stop taking Ozempic or Wegovy?

Popular weight-loss drugs are meant to be lifelong treatments for chronic diseases, not lifestyle fixes. Health columnist Sumathi Reddy breaks down  the benefits and risks [https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-stop-what-happens-162b6dd2] of taking a GLP-1 short term.

A: While nearly 18% of U.S. adults have taken a GLP-1 for weight loss or to treat a chronic condition, about half of people will stop taking it within a year. Often, they don’t understand what is likely to come next.

Studies show that after stopping the drugs, people typically regain lost weight within about 1.5 years. Any improvements in blood sugar, blood pressure or cholesterol are reversed.

People who take GLP-1s regain weight four times faster than those who lose weight through lifestyle interventions, according to an analysis published in the British Medical Journal.

Doctors largely say the drugs are worth starting even if you can’t stay on them long term, but caution the need for proper counseling and lifestyle changes.

The greatest success stories come from combining lifestyle changes with obesity medications, says Dr. Gitanjali Srivastava, medical director of obesity medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

Dr. Robert Kushner, an obesity-medicine specialist, recommends GLP-1 users consider a long-term strategy that could involve transitioning to a less-expensive, older-generation weight-loss medication or starting a more intensive lifestyle intervention.

Supermarkets have a new food-stamp conundrum.            

GRAPHIC: ANDREW MOLLICA

Eighteen states are moving to restrict what can be bought with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds. But the limits vary widely by state, and grocery executives say that determining which products are and aren’t food-stamp eligible has become a complex undertaking. Small differences, such as whether kettle corn is prepopped or  if pretzels are covered in yogurt [https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/is-a-cookie-a-type-of-candy-supermarkets-have-a-new-food-stamp-conundrum-51c3653c], can now determine whether an item can be purchased with food-assistance funds.

Flapping Airplanes is  part of a new wave [https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/these-billion-dollar-ai-startups-have-no-products-no-revenue-and-eager-investors-97c0a9ba] of startups some have dubbed “neolabs,” which give priority to long-term research and developing new AI models over immediate profits. Interest in neolabs has skyrocketed as investors hunt for the next OpenAI, which began as a research lab.

Is this boy band good enough to get a visa?

In U.S. immigration law, “extraordinary ability” typically refers to Olympic athletes or renowned artists. A fledgling boy band is hoping that going viral counts. Four 20-somethings debuted  Boy Throb [https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/music/is-this-boy-band-good-enough-to-get-a-visa-39f17ea3] on TikTok in November. “We’re the world’s next biggest boy band,” they proclaimed in one video. There’s one problem: Member Darshan Magdum lives in India. For the band to be complete, he needs a visa. To get it, Boy Throb must convince the government that their act is, in fact, extraordinary.
