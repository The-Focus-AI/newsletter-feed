✏️ Good morning. Last night, President Trump told the Journal’s Josh Dawsey that the administration was  reviewing the latest fatal shooting [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-administration-is-reviewing-everything-about-minneapolis-shooting-a501f48e] in Minneapolis and signaled a willingness to eventually withdraw immigration enforcement officials from the Twin Cities. The conflict reflects the nation’s split views of immigration policy—an issue that helped carry Trump to the White House a year ago. Many residents  see it as a fight [https://www.wsj.com/us-news/minneapolis-pretti-trump-immigration-protests-068b69d4] against an occupying army bent on subduing their progressive city.

Trump  told the Journal [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-administration-is-reviewing-everything-about-minneapolis-shooting-a501f48e] that immigration-enforcement officers will “at some point” leave Minneapolis.  Some Republicans have criticized Alex Pretti—who was killed by a federal Border Patrol agent—for carrying a gun during protest activity. But  Second Amendment groups [https://www.wsj.com/us-news/gun-rights-groups-clash-with-trump-officials-over-fatal-shooting-of-armed-protester-acf5e433] have long fought for the right to do so.  Senate Democrats, angered by the shooting in Minneapolis, threatened a partial government shutdown,  saying they wouldn’t vote [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/senate-democrats-vow-to-block-dhs-funding-risking-another-shutdown-54759b51] for a funding package without major changes to its homeland security provisions.

Michelle Bowman, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, has slashed staff and pursued what many inside and outside the central bank  view as a housecleaning [https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/how-trumps-ally-at-the-fed-is-remaking-bank-oversight-b1f0fab3] of the supervision and regulation division’s senior leadership.

This American city found itself at war with the U.S. government.

For months, Minneapolis’s mayor watched with dread as the number of federal agents in his city swelled to carry out Trump’s promise of the largest deportation of illegal immigrants in American history. Then Renee Good was fatally shot on Jan. 7 by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent during one of the many protests against the action. On Saturday, it happened again when Pretti was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent. Those fatalities  marked a new and alarming phase [https://www.wsj.com/us-news/minneapolis-pretti-trump-immigration-protests-068b69d4] in a confrontation between the residents of an American city, carrying phones and whistles, and armed officers of the U.S. government, report Joshua Chaffin and Michelle Hackman.

Health insurance is now more expensive than the mortgage for these Americans.

Millions are starting to see their monthly health-insurance bills rise. Many of those facing the most dramatic dollar increases are  middle-income earners [https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/aca-health-insurance-cost-subsidies-expire-37a595a9] who buy health insurance through the marketplaces set up by the government’s Affordable Care Act. Expanded subsidies for those insured under the act expired on Dec. 31. Now, they are having to figure out how to pay, or go without, reports Rachel Louise Ensign.

Q: What new rules could get you a bigger refund this tax season?

Taxpayers can file 2025 returns starting today. Reporters Ashlea Ebeling and Richard Rubin explain the  most important changes [https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/taxes/tax-deductions-2025-refunds-7a6a64bd] you need to be aware of.

A: Americans can expect smaller tax bills and bigger refunds this year—after they navigate a pile of new rules from last year’s tax law.

The standard deduction for 2025 is $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly. Last year’s tax law raised those by $750 and $1,500, respectively, on top of the Internal Revenue Service’s normal year-to-year inflation adjustments.

Taking the standard deduction is still the best option financially for nearly 90% of taxpayers. Still, this year’s changes might mean you would be better off itemizing your deductions.

Another change to be aware of: The maximum state-and-local-tax deduction for property taxes plus income or sales taxes is $40,000 for 2025, up from $10,000. As a result, many taxpayers will be better off itemizing instead of taking the standard deduction this year.

Be aware, however, that the maximum SALT deduction begins phasing down to $10,000 once a taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income crosses $500,000, whether single or married filing jointly.

Other tax laws offer credits and deductions for parents, seniors and those with overtime pay, among other categories.

Just because you get a new federal tax break doesn’t mean it also applies to your state income-tax return. California, for example, doesn’t have its own versions of the tax law’s new deductions for people 65 and up, tipped and overtime workers or auto-loan interest.

In one Kyiv apartment building, they are freezing—but not giving up.

Four years of Russian airstrikes have devastated Ukraine’s electricity grid and disrupted heating. A million Kyiv residents were without power as of Tuesday evening. But there hasn’t been the societal collapse that Russia has long sought by attacking civilian infrastructure. Instead, Ukrainians are showing the  resilience and make-do attitude [https://www.wsj.com/world/here-in-one-kyiv-apartment-building-they-are-freezingbut-not-giving-up-a66d812f] that have frustrated Moscow’s efforts to pummel them into submission.

The estimated number of people in the path of  a massive winter storm [https://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/winter-storm-blankets-central-and-eastern-u-s-628cd9f7] lashing parts of the U.S. with snow, causing frozen roads and thousands of flight cancellations and power outages. Forecasters said the storm would stretch 2,000 miles from New Mexico to Maine; one meteorologist at the National Weather Service told the Journal it is “rare” for a storm to have that wide of an expanse.

There’s a secret society of people who know the formula for WD-40.

The handwritten formula for WD-40 is kept in a lockbox at an undisclosed Bank of America location in San Diego. The notebook is the only version that has the full makeup of the original formula, which accounted for nearly  80% of WD-40’s revenue [https://www.wsj.com/business/the-secret-society-of-people-who-know-the-formula-for-wd-40-e9c0ff54] as of August 2025. Seeing it requires a special key, nondisclosure agreements, passage through a bank vault and, typically, an executive title. Steve Brass, the chief executive at WD-40, was only admitted 18 months ago.

Opinion: Alex Pretti  made a mistake [https://www.wsj.com/opinion/time-for-ice-to-pause-in-minneapolis-e9ecf097] by interfering with ICE agents, but he wasn’t a “domestic terrorist” who deserved to be shot.
