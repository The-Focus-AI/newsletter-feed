Washington’s new lobbyists are paid online influencers with few rules.

Trump’s return to the White House has transformed the federal government and disrupted the business of lobbying. Industry groups and foreign governments are now tapping  pro-Trump social-media stars [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/washington-lobbyists-paid-online-influencers-few-rules-69eccd13] to push their causes. Gen-Z social-media natives—many of whom were too young to vote when Trump announced his first run for office—are reaping the rewards. From Israel fighting negative sentiment on the right to the solar industry promoting its agenda, the goal is the same: turning viral reach into political results, report Maggie Severns, Natalie Andrews, Josh Dawsey and Eliza Collins.

Q: The flu is surging. How can antivirals help?

Influenza climbed to unusually high levels across the country, thanks to a flu strain that  caught us off guard [https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/the-flu-is-surging-how-antivirals-can-help-179245dc]. Columnist Sumathi Reddy asked doctors how antiviral drugs work, who should take them and why timing matters.

A: It is the worst flu season in recent years. This year’s dominant H3N2 “subclade K” strain mutated after the strains for the current flu vaccine were picked. Still, doctors recommend getting vaccinated to reduce the severity of the flu.

Antivirals like Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) and Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) can shorten the flu by about a day if started within 48 hours of symptom onset. Both can also be prescribed if you’ve been exposed to the flu and want to take it prophylactically.

Xofluza prevents the virus from replicating inside a cell, while Tamiflu prevents the virus’s copies from leaving the cell to infect others, Dr. Neha Vyas, a family medicine physician at the Cleveland Clinic, explains.

The main advantage of Xofluza is it’s a single-dose pill; Tamiflu requires taking two doses for five days. Xofluza can be taken by anyone age 5 or older, but isn’t recommended for pregnant or breast-feeding mothers, or those with a known hypersensitivity to baloxavir marboxil. Tamiflu can be taken by babies and even infants who are over 2 weeks old.

Doctors say Tamiflu can cause more side effects, namely nausea and vomiting, while Xofluza’s main side effect is diarrhea.

One common misconception: You don’t need to get the flu vaccine if you’ve already had the flu. Not so, given there can be two peaks and there are different strains.

The rough percentage of rentals in Phoenix that are giving tenants at least  one month off their rent [https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/commercial/housing-supply-prices-free-rent-a8278a65], the highest proportion in the country. To attract tenants, landlords are offering discounts ranging from one to three months, plus perks like Amazon gift cards, discounted sports tickets and free moving trucks. The renter-friendly environment in Phoenix is a symptom of the city’s enormous glut of high-end apartments.

They loved their Roomba like a pet. Then it lost its way.

Long before there were chatbots and humanoids, there was the Roomba. The autonomous floor cleaner wasn’t the first robotic vacuum on the market, but it became the best known. Humans bonded with their Roombas, giving them  names like Dirt Reynolds [https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/roomba-bankruptcy-irobot-vacuum-cleaner-724d1164], but the agents of chaos tested their affection. Videos abound of Roombas terrorizing pets, making epic messes and going AWOL.
