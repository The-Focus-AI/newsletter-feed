✏️ After an audition fit for reality TV, Kevin Warsh finally won the Fed chair contest. The former Fed governor  boxed out the other Kevin [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/how-warsh-won-fed-job-ff9d02bc]—Kevin Hassett—to win President Trump’s nomination to lead the central bank. But now comes the hard part. Warsh must find a way to shrink the balance sheet and reduce inflation without compromising the Fed’s independence. Plus, he needs to avoid upsetting the markets—or Trump.  It won’t be easy [https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/kevin-warshs-three-tasks-shrink-the-fed-tame-inflation-manage-the-president-2640eace], writes Greg Ip. Wall Street, meanwhile, can’t seem to decide whether  Warsh will be a friend or foe [https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/wall-street-cant-decide-whether-kevin-warsh-will-be-a-friend-or-foe-3d344c67].

Here’s how Warsh survived Trump’s ultimate reality show.

The president's announcement that Warsh was his pick to replace Jerome Powell capped one of the most public personnel contests of Trump’s second term. The choice came after some White House officials had written off Warsh entirely, report Nick Timiraos and Brian Schwartz. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, thought he had the job wrapped up in November. But  Warsh had something Hassett didn’t [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/how-warsh-won-fed-job-ff9d02bc]: a big network of CEOs, finance bigwigs and creatures of the GOP establishment. Warsh leveraged those connections to reinsert himself into the conversation. Hassett’s closeness to Trump—once his greatest asset—ultimately became a liability.

“America First” risks becoming “America Alone.”

In the past year, Trump has cut off most forms of U.S. foreign aid, pulled out of scores of multilateral institutions and hurled insults and threats at longtime allies. Predictably, positive  views of the U.S. are declining [https://www.wsj.com/world/how-america-first-risks-becoming-america-alone-6592701a] in much of the world. But the shift won’t merely make it less comfortable for Americans to travel abroad, report David Luhnow, Sune Engel Rasmussen and Bertrand Benoit. It will hurt U.S. companies competing overseas and it may also mean a more dangerous world, as countries from Europe to Asia are left with no choice but to rearm as they lose faith in U.S. security guarantees.

EXPERT TAKE

Q: A Hong Kong company’s contract to run two Panama Canal ports was canceled. Why does it matter?

Panama’s supreme court annulled CK Hutchison’s license to operate the ports at either end of the canal. Reporters Santiago Pérez, Costas Paris and James T. Areddy wrote about the  strategic implications of the decision [https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/why-a-ruling-over-ck-hutchisons-panama-canal-ports-mattersand-whats-next-a2f09720].

A: The decision sets the stage for the Hong Kong company’s departure from the facilities in a move with broad geopolitical ramifications. It represents a diplomatic defeat for China, as it dents Beijing’s influence in Latin America. It also hands President Trump a symbolic victory for his political and security priorities in the Western Hemisphere.

The termination of Hutchison’s license throws a wrench into the company’s plans to sell more than 40 ports globally to BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Co. for almost $23 billion. The deal already looked to be in peril prior to the ruling, with China’s government threatening to block the transaction if state-run shipping company Cosco wasn’t added as an equal partner with veto power.

But removing the two coveted Panama container terminals from the equation could clear a path to a deal for the remaining ports, which are less politically contentious.

The decision adds to pressure on China in the Western Hemisphere and suggests to other governments that they might re-examine their ties to the world’s second-biggest economy while Trump is in office.

The hype around the fluffy dolls—which are sold by Beijing-based toy maker Pop Mart—is giving  China’s global cultural profile [https://www.wsj.com/world/china/labubu-youtube-influencers-gen-z-7271596a] some timely gloss, just as U.S. soft power is losing some of its sheen. In a shift away from staid state-led diplomacy initiatives, the Communist Party is now allowing commercial successes—from Labubus to TikTok to hit films—to help to define China’s standing on the world stage.
