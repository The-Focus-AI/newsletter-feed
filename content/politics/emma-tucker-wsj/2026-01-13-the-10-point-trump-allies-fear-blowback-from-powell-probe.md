Trump allies and officials fear blowback from the Powell probe.

Several Senate Republicans have expressed concern with the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Powell, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said he hoped the dispute was resolved quickly. Others  worried that the fight [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-allies-and-officials-fear-blowback-from-powell-probe-ad5fe594] would rattle markets and boost borrowing costs. Some aides in the White House were concerned about the market reaction to the probe, according to administration officials, one of whom said the White House wasn’t made aware of the investigation in advance. One administration official who lobbied for a probe was Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, report Brian Schwartz, Meridith McGraw, Josh Dawsey and Nick Timiraos.

America’s biggest power-grid operator has an AI problem.

America’s artificial intelligence boom is pushing the nation’s largest power-grid operator to  the brink of a supply crisis [https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/power-grid-ai-data-centers-1235f296]. Sixty-seven million people get their power from a market operated by nonprofit PJM. So, too, do the many AI data centers springing up in Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley,” which have a bottomless appetite for electricity. Rates are going up for consumers and the grid’s capacity is in danger of maxing out during periods of high demand, report Katherine Blunt and Jennifer Hiller.

EXPERT TAKE

Q: What is the investigation into Powell about and why does it matter?

The Justice Department’s probe represents an escalation of an unprecedented White House campaign to shape what happens at the central bank. Reporter Matt Grossman explains what you need to know about the conflict and  what it could mean [https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/the-fed-trump-feud-what-you-need-to-know-ef8fbe93] for the Fed’s future.

A: The investigation is centered on testimony Powell gave to Congress last summer, when he defended the Fed’s efforts to renovate its headquarters in Washington. Trump and his allies have seized on the project’s duration and expense to argue Powell has managed the central bank poorly.

Powell said Sunday that Trump’s fixation on the construction project is only a pretext for gaining leverage in a deeper conflict: Trump’s demands, going back years, that Powell more aggressively slash interest rates.

Fed independence is a highly sensitive issue for financial markets, where investors rely on the Fed to make policy based on economic reality, not the president’s political preferences.

Investors worry that presidents would often favor cutting rates too aggressively, prioritizing a booming economy over keeping inflation low.

On Monday, markets didn’t move dramatically. Yet gold prices rallied and the dollar depreciated against foreign currencies, moves that could signal jitters about the U.S. policy landscape.

Powell’s term as Fed chair ends in May, but his term as an ordinary Fed governor extends until 2028. Powell hasn’t said whether he will stay on.

In Midland, Texas, the last thing anyone wants is cheap Venezuelan oil.

For most Americans, cheap oil is good news. In Midland, Texas,  it is a problem [https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/oil-prices-jobs-midland-texas-2a818d55]. Oil prices have mostly slumped since last spring, and the U.S. intervention in oil-rich Venezuela is stoking Trump’s desire to push prices down further. This raises a new risk for Midland, where a host of businesses linked to the oil field are feeling squeezed.
