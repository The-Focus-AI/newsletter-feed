✏️ What to make of Trumponomics? In April, “Liberation Day” tariffs spooked analysts. Today it’s more of a mixed bag. Though economists are  boosting their previously gloomy forecasts [https://www.wsj.com/economy/economist-survey-2026-growth-outlook-7e5d8feb], uncertainty persists. President Trump’s challenge to Fed independence, for example, is  threatening the dollar’s dominance [https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/fed-turmoil-is-threatening-dollar-supremacy-just-as-china-pushes-the-yuan-3ebb781d]—just as Beijing pushes the yuan. Speaking of economics, I'm heading to Davos this week for the World Economic Forum, where I'll interview the CEOs of Anthropic and Goldman Sachs at  WSJ [https://journalhouse.wsj.com/world-economic-forum/] ’s [https://journalhouse.wsj.com/world-economic-forum/]  Journal House [https://journalhouse.wsj.com/world-economic-forum/].

This Wall Street legend ran a penthouse sex dungeon, prosecutors say.

Howard Rubin rose, fell and rose again as a star trader in the 1980s, embodying the excessive wealth and risk of a gunslinger era in finance. Now he’s been  charged with luring women [https://www.wsj.com/us-news/howard-rubin-wall-street-sex-trafficking-aabc00c4] into what he called his sex “dungeon,” where he abused and tortured them high above the Manhattan skyline. Since being arrested for sex trafficking and other crimes in September, the 70-year-old now lives in a Brooklyn jail cell. His attorneys, allies and even his estranged wife say he’s a retiree living a quiet life. He has pleaded not guilty. Rubin’s lawyers have argued that the women were aware of what the encounters involved and were willing participants.

Germany’s military recruitment drive has a Gen Z problem.

European nations have stepped up military spending to prepare for a potential conflict with Russia, and the country on the front line of the rearmament effort is struggling to meet its recruitment goals, reports Bertrand Benoit. The problem isn’t pacifism, but young people posing a new variation on the age-old question: “What is in it for me?” After Germany introduced a new military service, for now on a voluntary basis, tens of thousands of school-age demonstrators took to the streets. Their objections are more about economics than politics— a big difference from the idealism [https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/germanys-military-recruitment-drive-has-a-gen-z-problem-577d535b] of the German peace movement in the 1970s and 1980s.

Q: Silicon Valley worries the American Dream is dying. Why?

Some in the tech world fear this is the  last chance to amass generational wealth [https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/why-the-tech-world-thinks-the-american-dream-is-dying-daf793dc] before AI makes money essentially worthless. Columnist Tim Higgins explains where this perspective comes from.

A: One of Silicon Valley’s wild-eyed ideas—long debated on subreddits and in hacker houses—is becoming a real-life nightmare.

The argument is that tech companies (and their leaders) will become a class unto their own with infinite wealth. No one else will have the means to generate money for themselves because AI will have taken their jobs and opportunities.

In other words, the bridge is about to be raised for those chasing the American dream. And everyone is worried about being left on the wrong side.

It’s the kind of FOMO that on first blush seems to require a huge suspension of disbelief. But the idea’s mere existence helps explain some of the increasing class worries in California, where a growing movement to tax billionaires is roiling the Democratic Party, affordable housing is a real concern and the idea of the middle class seems out of reach.

Yes, it smacks of sci-fi thinking. But in San Francisco it feels real. And it’s made more believable by the exploits of Elon Musk, the rise of OpenAI’s Sam Altman and warnings by Anthropic’s Dario Amodei about Great Depression-like worker displacement.
