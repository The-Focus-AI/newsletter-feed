Good morning! ☀️ I’ve taken a brief break from vibe coding WSJ articles to vibe write this newsletter. (Seriously, I just type what I want to see here and it appears!) This week’s Big Thing is all about everyone’s ❤️ for Claude Code. Then, Apple Siri and AI hardware reports have reached new levels, Silicon Valley’s hottest AI startups are in peak chaos and OpenAI is putting ads in ChatGPT. Plus: Spotify has rolled out a new AI playlist feature—which is not the same as its old AI playlist feature. 🎧

The Big Thing

Ben Cohen, the WSJʼs Science of Success columnist, and I love vibe coding together. This is not a euphemism. (Please donʼt report me to HR.) We type ideas for apps, websites and other software features into Claude Code, watch the AI spit out the working creations, then brag about them via text message.

For the unfamiliar, vibe coding is the ancient practice of having AI write computer code for you. You don’t even need to know how to code. You type in a prompt (“Make a WSJ article with iMessage-like chats”) and the AI builds a working prototype. Anthropic’s Claude Code has taken the internet by storm over the past few weeks because of the fun and useful things people have made with it.

So when Ben and I started comparing our creations—kids’ games, expense apps, column-search tools—we decided the obvious next step was to write a column about Claude Code using Claude Code. That’s how we ended up with  this interactive column that posted this morning [https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-claude-vibe-coding-experiment-a4a3bb0f].

I started by asking Claude Code to design a website that looked like iMessage chats. Then I asked it to make those chats look like old-school AIM messages. Then I asked for a newspaper mode. At each step, I guided Claude with plain-English requests.

I’d watched people gush about the tool for weeks, but I didn’t really get it until I was making this article. I’d previously used Cursor to make a game for my kids, but with Claude Code, I hit far fewer roadblocks and errors.

It still requires a bit of technical patience, but Anthropic has also released Claude Cowork, which makes things even easier. The simplest way to try it is through the Mac or Windows Claude apps. (You’ll need a $20-a-month Pro account to use it.)

If you’re willing to learn a few new tricks, I highly recommend giving it a shot—if only so you can brag to your friends about what you made. And if you want to report any bugs or issues with our interactive column, please contact my new colleague, Claude Code.

Apple’s Next AI Moves 🍎🔮

After a slow start in the contest for AI supremacy, Apple is working on an  AI-powered wearable pin [https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-developing-ai-wearable-pin] that could arrive in 2027, according to the Information. At this point, the bar is low—nowhere to go but up from the  failed Humane Pin [https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/the-ai-gadget-that-can-make-your-life-betterand-two-that-definitely-wont-c51f49f0?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqfWhTJ6TCFkp6-heHsy5w-oMJeTvdYotf5-PtuTTGvQTxzPoS4y8drtqUru_A4%3D&gaa_ts=6972cdc0&gaa_sig=5XVtuDHv2meOvJPLDrUKkFm7wgiy6dmQ_pTskCDHJuxBa3ZVYxhUfVdBReLVvvtPMn71IFmpCymTtStM4Xy1rQ%3D%3D]. Also, just a thought: Wouldn’t the Apple Watch make a pretty great AI wearable? The device could position Apple to compete with OpenAI, which is developing its own wearable with former Apple designer Jony Ive. More likely to happen sooner: Apple is reportedly planning to  transform Siri into a ChatGPT-style bot [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/ios-27-apple-to-revamp-siri-as-built-in-iphone-mac-chatbot-to-fend-off-openai] later in 2026 that works across iPhones, iPads and Macs, according to Bloomberg.

The Real Housebros of Silicon Valley 🤖🍿

The tech world is currently glued to the drama that is  Thinking Machines Lab [https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-messy-human-drama-that-dealt-a-blow-to-one-of-ais-hottest-startups-b86d736a], the AI startup founded by a crew of ex-OpenAI employees. Turns out even large language models can’t predict the behavior of the human heart. Barret Zoph, a co-founder of Thinking Machines and former OpenAI exec, was fired after CEO Mira Murati (also former OpenAI) learned about an undisclosed romantic relationship with a colleague (yes, a human one…who also came from OpenAI). Within hours of being shown the door, Zoph signed an offer to return to—say it with me—OpenAI. And he brought two other defectors with him. Zoph said he was fired after he expressed an intent to take a job elsewhere.

AI’s Advertising Schism 💸🛡️

OpenAI said it plans to  start testing ads in ChatGPT [https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-to-begin-testing-ads-in-chatgpt-in-push-for-fresh-revenue-a5e0e993?] for the first time, marking a screeching turnaround for a company whose CEO, Sam Altman, once described advertising as “a last resort.” The move comes as Altman scrambles for new revenue sources for OpenAI, which has committed to spending hundreds of billions in the coming years. Newsflash: It doesn’t currently make hundreds of billions. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis told Axios he was  “surprised” OpenAI would bring ads to ChatGPT [https://www.axios.com/2026/01/21/chatgpt-ads-google-gemini-demis-hassabis] so soon, saying Google had no plans for ads in its Gemini assistant. To be clear, Google has ads everywhere else.

A Thing to Try

This week, Spotify announced a new AI tool called Prompted Playlist, NOT to be confused with Spotify’s earlier—and still kicking—AI Playlist, which I  wrote about back in October 2024 [https://techthings.cmail19.com/t/d-e-euhddky-l-r/].

In the iOS and Android app, tap Create in the bottom right, then Prompted Playlist. I typed: “a playlist I can write and work to, with a mix of acoustic rock, classic rock and newer bands I might like.” I hit Generate playlist and, within a minute, had a new “Rockin’ Work Mix.” The picks weren’t bad—Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Eagles, The Lumineers, Mumford & Sons—but Spotify stacked the classic rock at the top and pushed the newer bands to the back half, where I would’ve preferred them mixed together. You can set the playlist to update daily or weekly.

The tool is rolling out this week to most Premium users in the U.S. and Canada. One could reasonably ask why this couldn’t have just been an update to the original feature. But I like this thing so whatever!

Throwback Thing                 Who?

Calvin Mew from New York

What?

Nintendo Game Boy Color

When?

1998

Why?

In 1999 I visited my godson William, who was playing with a Nintendo Game Boy Color. He was eight at the time, and I’d never seen anything like it before. He let me play “Pac-Man” on the device. Then he showed me the game that intrigued him at the time: “Pokémon.” On the following Father’s Day, William gave me a Game Boy Color, and he included the game “Pokémon Gold.” Soon I was involved with capturing Pokémons. The game was not addictive—well, maybe it was—but it was an excellent diversion from my work life. After I graduated to “Pokémon Silver” and “Pokémon Crystal,” William would give me hints about how to be more successful in my battles. When I pulled out my Game Boy to replace my IBM ThinkPad on long flights for business, my traveling companions were interested and amused.
