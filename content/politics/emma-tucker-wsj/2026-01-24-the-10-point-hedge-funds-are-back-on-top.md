✏️ Hedge funds are back on top of Wall Street’s pecking order. In 2025, performance across these funds was the best it’s been in over a decade, and investors are poised to keep  pumping money into the asset class [https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/hedge-funds-are-back-on-top-after-a-long-alpha-winter-f5c7cd21] this year. For Intel, it’s been a tougher ride. After months of positive vibes, investors saw the chip maker’s stock come crashing back to earth this week. We look at how the company missed out on what should’ve been  an easy win [https://www.wsj.com/tech/intel-problems-trump-bump-17d2c941].

As some progressives  push to disband ICE, [https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/democrat-respone-abolish-ice-bc51a946] Democrats face a familiar debate about how to resist Trump policies without being perceived as the anti-law-and-order party.  At Davos,  President Trump’s disruptive presence [https://www.wsj.com/business/sometimes-you-need-a-dictator-trump-davos-world-economic-forum-4f3d141d] forced attendees to make decisions about big issues (a prospective U.S. takeover of Greenland) and small ones (conflicting parties).  China’s Xi Jinping has put his No. 1 general under investigation, extending a crackdown on military corruption and disloyalty that is  hollowing out the top ranks [https://www.wsj.com/world/china/chinas-xi-places-his-top-general-under-investigation-as-military-purges-heat-up-d07f9c7d].  The Syrian president’s offensive against a Kurdish-led militia has proved his military boldness and willingness to  risk his relationship [https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/syria-ahmed-sharaa-us-troops-a1b0a1d9] with the U.S.  Generative AI is making voice interactions with devices more productive and less annoying, and  tech will never be the same [https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/voice-technology-ai-hardware-4d39f6d2], writes Christopher Mims.

The  Dow industrials ticked 0.5% lower this week [https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/u-s-stocks-zigzag-on-geopolitical-news-ending-week-where-they-started-50855d49], while the S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.1%, showing few signs that markets had narrowly avoided a potential trade shock.  A 17% dive in Intel’s stock—which had been  buoyed by votes of confidence [https://www.wsj.com/tech/intel-problems-trump-bump-17d2c941] from the White House, Nvidia and SoftBank—came after an earnings call revealed the chip maker had struggled to meet booming AI-linked demand.  Adam Jonas, a top researcher at Morgan Stanley, is betting his reputation on  robots and flying cars [https://www.wsj.com/tech/profile-of-morgan-stanley-adam-jonas-robot-strategist-42ffcc6c].

With the fate of Greenland in flux, it’s back to the age of empire.

Though Trump has backed down—for now—from threats to use economic or military coercion to take over the Danish territory,  the shock of the U.S.’s expansionist ambition [https://www.wsj.com/world/with-the-fate-of-greenland-in-flux-its-back-to-the-age-of-empire-b7b7f552] still hangs in the air, report Drew Hinshaw and Marcus Walker. In European capitals, there’s little confidence trans-Atlantic relations will return to normal. In remarks this week, Trump cast territorial expansion as a normal historical process. What he failed to mention: Most land gains in the age of empires were achieved through bloodshed, not purchase. And when money changed hands, it was sometimes under duress as the victor in a war imposed a sale on the loser.

This NFL season’s fiercest rivalry is sports betting vs. prediction markets.

Americans are expected to set a record by wagering more than $1.5 billion on the Super Bowl. For the first time, nearly everyone in the U.S. will be able to get in on the action thanks to prediction-market companies Polymarket and Kalshi, which are  challenging sports-betting giants [https://www.wsj.com/business/media/this-nfl-seasons-fiercest-rivalry-is-sports-betting-vs-prediction-markets-1952aa61] FanDuel and DraftKings. Though sports betting remains illegal in 11 states, federally regulated prediction markets allow a way in, report Katherine Sayre and Jared Diamond. These markets let users bet on outcomes in many fields, including politics and popular culture, but sports remain the majority of their business.

Q: Europe is worried the U.S. could block access to its tech. How big of a problem would that be?

Rising tensions with the U.S. are spurring new  plans in Europe to break with American technology [https://www.wsj.com/tech/europe-prepares-for-a-nightmare-scenario-the-u-s-blocking-access-to-tech-1967b39b] in favor of homegrown alternatives. Reporters Sam Schechner, Berber Jin and Kim Mackrael wrote about the region’s push for “technological sovereignty.”

A: Trump’s approach to Greenland has pushed European officials and diplomats to toughen their views on the need for Europe to curb its dependence on the U.S., from tech to defense to trade. The European Parliament on Thursday passed a “technological sovereignty” resolution that supports using public procurement criteria to favor European products where possible and proposes new legislation to promote European cloud providers.

A potential “decoupling” of Europe and U.S. tech was a hot topic among business leaders and policymakers at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. Many said it would be a complex undertaking given the breadth of American tech used.

The scale of Europe’s dependence on U.S. tech has never been so large, particularly for cloud-computing services from companies including Amazon, Google and Microsoft. In 2024, European customers spent nearly $25 billion on infrastructure services from the top five U.S. cloud companies, or 83% of the total market in Europe, according to research firm IDC.

Many European entrepreneurs blame Europe’s plight on a risk-averse culture, a fragmented market and onerous regulations. That’s in large part why the EU is now trying to relax some of its digital rules, though progress has so far been slow.

Investors are flocking back to hedge funds after an ‘alpha winter.’                                                        

A recent stretch of strong returns is making hedge funds  the most favored asset class [https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/hedge-funds-are-back-on-top-after-a-long-alpha-winter-f5c7cd21] for institutions that allocate money to outside investment firms, according to a Goldman Sachs survey of 317 fund investors viewed by WSJ. About 45% of them plan to increase their exposure to hedge funds in 2026, net of those looking to decrease it, an all-time high in survey records going back to 2017 and an 18-percentage-point increase from last year.

The number of  barrels of Venezuelan oil [https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/china-venezuela-oil-trump-65ce1da2] to which Chinese government-owned oil companies hold claims, nearly five times as much as Chevron, the only U.S. major that today produces in the South American nation. Beijing’s production deals, oil rigs and debt-backed supply arrangements have long bought it enormous sway in Venezuela—and all of it is now subject to the Trump administration’s preferences.

Why choose between a ski vacation and an urban escape?

A day on the mountain might not be the type of escape you usually tack onto a vacation at the last minute. But it’s surprisingly  easy to pull off from a few cities [https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/travel/three-cities-where-its-easy-to-tack-on-a-day-of-skiing-05c8acbc], including Denver, Tokyo and Munich. In these three locations on three continents, here’s how you can get out on the snow after breakfast and still be back in time for après-ski cocktails at the hotel bar.
