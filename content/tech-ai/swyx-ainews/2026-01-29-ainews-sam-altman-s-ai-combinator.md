Before recording started at the OpenAI Town Hall  this week, Sam Altman gave us the question that was at the top of his mind. So I asked Sam  on his behalf:
Swyx: I tend to think in terms of constraints. On the consumption side, human attention is the rate-limiting factor. On the production side—especially for builders—the bottleneck is the quality of ideas. I spend a lot of time helping AI companies with GTM, and honestly, many of the products just aren’t worth people’s attention. So my question is: what tools can we build to improve the quality of ideas people come up with?
—-
Sama: It’s popular to talk about “AI slop,” but there’s also a huge amount of human-generated slop in the world. (swyx: we agree !) Coming up with genuinely good, new ideas is hard. I increasingly believe that we think at the limits of our tools, and that we should explicitly try to build tools that help people think better.
As the cost of creation continues to plummet, we’ll be able to run much tighter feedback loops—try ideas faster, discard bad ones sooner, and find the good ones more reliably. If AI can discover new science and write very complex codebases, it seems obvious that there’s a much larger possibility space opening up.
But today, a very common experience is sitting in front of an AI system—say, an agentic code writer—and not knowing what to ask for next. A lot of people report this. 
I believe we can build tools to help you come up with good ideas.  I believe we could look at all your past work and all your past code and try to figure out what might be useful to you or interesting to you and and can just continuously suggest things. 
We can build really great brainstorming partners. There have been like three or four people in my life that I have consistently found every time I hang out with them, I leave with a lot of ideas. They’re people who are just really good at asking questions or giving you seeds to build on. 
Paul Graham is off the charts amazing at this. If we could build something like a “Paul Graham bot” that you can have the same kind of interaction with to help generate new ideas, even if most of them are bad, even if you say “absolutely not” to 95% of them, I think something like that is going to be a very significant contribution to the amount of good stuff that gets built in the world. 
The models feel like they ought to be capable of that. With 5.2, a special version of 5.2 we use internally, we’re now for the first time hearing from scientists that these the scientific progress of these models is no longer super trivial. And I just can’t believe that a model that can come up with new scientific insights is not also capable, with a different harness and trained a little bit differently, of coming up with new insights about products to build.
You can catch the full text in his own words here: 
Reflections on “AI Paul Graham”
There are a few reactions I have here that I’ll fire off in quick succession:
It’s nice to see him acknowledge that the potential of AI is not just in helping to attract more attention through generated images and videos and marketing text (AI GTM, the first question from the town hall), but also it should be used in raising the quality of product, because there is a lot of human-origin slop too!
In many ways, Sam here is trying to bring in what YCombinator does for improving founder success to the general thought partnership capability of ChatGPT. Everyone could benefit from having their own personal YC Group Partner, on demand, no office hours. Much less having a PG-tier Partner. And yes, this is just the business form of the more general domain of advising and coaching, which probably everyone can benefit from if we knew how to make it good enough.
Many, many people have tried to build an “AI Paul Graham” bot. These flopped because they mostly did RAG or finetunes on his essays. Information Retrieval isn’t what PG -does- for Sam. He challenges you, runs you through multiple internal world models and pattern matches of past learned experiences, filters through what he should say to elicit the best response out of you instead of simply blurting out what he thinks token by token, and raises your ambitions.
For both model trainers and agent harness builders, it’s instructive to draw a spectrum from the poorest implementation to the most ambitious implementation you can think of, and think about the sequencing of intelligent feedback and pushback you need.
It is too lazy to wait for the God Model to arrive to do all these, there are probably concrete thought partner jobs that can be broken out into Agent Skills and MCP tools and Multi-agent Swarms and other tricks of the AI Engineer trade.
“Accuracy” for an AI PG is not 90%, not even 50% — even a 5% accurate PG is acceptable and valuable (and is probably reflective of most real life conversations with him - most questions or comments are NOT valuable, but a human filter on the comments will surface some very generative and out of distribution “seeds”). So this is a very scalable “throw shit at the wall” task where AI can act as mass generator and Humans can act as discriminator/judge, and our existence proof that high-miss-rate question generation is still useful is YCombinator and Sam’s personal experience.
When faced with “AI as thought partner” I see a lot of parallels with the alignment problem, and I often think about the Weak-to-Strong Superalignment  diagram:
Where we are currently treating agents as a junior Software Engineer or “research intern ” (this is certainly the relationship we have with ChatGPT or Prism  today), we want to build the PG agent that is smarter than us, and perhaps the path there is to build smart agents for dumber people/usecases and then ladder up from there.
AI Twitter Recap
Frontier model “personality split” + how people are actually using them
Exploration vs. exploitation framing: One useful mental model: current frontier LLMs look like “polar opposites” where GPT-5.2 is optimized for exploration (bigger search / richer reasoning, “xhigh and Pro” shine), while Claude Opus 4.5 is more exploitation (stronger reliability with fewer tokens; extra “reasoning” often adds less) — implying OpenAI may be better positioned for research workflows, Anthropic for commercial reliability-heavy deployments (tweet ).
Coding agent “phase shift” is real—but messy: Multiple posts reflect a step-change in practice: founders and engineers are increasingly running “agentic” coding loops, yet hitting new failure modes: agents that don’t ask clarifying questions, get “confused,” or edit unrelated files. Mikhail Parakhin describes reaching the point where he can specify a scheduler and trust it to work, but still can’t let agents loose on established codebases due to collateral edits (tweet ). Related: workflow suggestions like self-verification (e.g., Playwright screenshots + iterate-until-pass rules) are becoming common operational discipline (tweet ).
Kimi K2.5 (+ “clawdbot” / swarm-mode) becomes the week’s open-model flashpoint
K2.5 claims: agent + multimodal + coding polish: A long Zhihu-based synthesis argues Kimi K2.5 upgrades K2’s “intelligence > capability” imbalance by strengthening agent execution, multimodality, and coding, reducing brute-force token usage and improving instruction-following stability; still flagged: hallucinations and a persistent NBSP formatting quirk (thread ). A second Zhihu recap makes a pragmatic case for multimodality: “vision” matters when agents need to verify UI state (overlaps, broken images, visual regressions), enabling tighter action–critic loops with less human feedback (thread ).
Distribution + local runs are driving hype: Reports of K2.5 being runnable on high-end Apple silicon setups went viral: ~24 tok/s using 2× 512GB M3 Ultra Mac Studios connected via Thunderbolt 5 (RDMA) with Exo Labs / MLX backend (tweet ). Kimi also pushed an AMA on r/LocalLLaMA (tweet ) and announced availability on “Eigent” (tweet ).
Benchmarks + pricing pressure: Kilo Code promoted a free week, claiming K2.5 beats Opus 4.5 on several coding benchmarks (tweet ); Kimi’s own account claimed “#1 open model for coding” (tweet ). An anecdotal A/B/C test on UI-from-image generation found Opus best quality but pricey, Codex fastest/cheapest but lower fidelity, and K2.5 ~“90% of Opus quality at ~38% cost” (tweet ).
Licensing friction as an adoption blocker: A pointed note argues modified licenses + logo requirements can kill enterprise adoption even if the model is excellent (tweet ).
“Clawdbot” as a cultural artifact: The meme itself (people confused about what “clawdbot” even is) reflects how fast agent branding and forks proliferate (tweet ), and sets up broader concerns about ecosystem signal loss (see below).
Agent engineering: skills, harnesses, evals, and “reliability tax”
Skills are crystallizing into a shared interface layer: A major theme is moving workflow logic out of prompts into reusable “skills” (files/folders of instructions, loaded on demand). DeepLearning.AI + Anthropic launched a course on “Agent Skills” emphasizing portability across Claude (Claude.ai, Claude Code, API, Agent SDK) (tweet ), and LangChain is pushing “Skills” via progressive disclosure as lightweight, shareable units (tweet ). HF showcased “upskill”: convert strong-model traces into transferable skills, then evaluate impact; CUDA-kernel-writing saw up to +45% accuracy on some open models but degraded others—reinforcing the need for per-model measurement (tweet ; blog link in thread: 
).
Context management is becoming “filesystem-first”: DeepAgents (LangChain) describes offloading/summarizing tool I/O and leaning on the filesystem for context boundaries (thread ; additional note: tweet ).
Evals are converging on multi-turn + traceability: Calls for agent tracing as the foundation of evaluating single-step vs full-turn vs multi-turn behavior show up explicitly (tweet ). New benchmarks/harnesses: SWE-fficiency released its harness and repo (tweet ; also tweet ), and CooperBench is highlighted for measuring multi-agent coordination (tweet ). Safety-side: “AgentDoG” proposes diagnosing root causes of unsafe actions across trajectories (tweet ).
Reliability and verification loops are the bottleneck: MiniMax notes long interaction chains are costly and proposes parallel tool invocation to reduce rounds in verifier-style setups (tweet ). Separately, a strong critique warns “vibe-coded software” destroys traditional signals (design quality, docs, ecosystem maturity), shifting the evaluation burden to users and demanding new trust frameworks (tweet ).
Infra + efficiency: quantization, distillation, inference stacks, and local deployment
NVIDIA’s NVFP4 push (Nemotron 3 Nano): NVIDIA released an NVFP4 precision version of Nemotron 3 Nano, claiming up to 4× throughput on Blackwell B200 and ~99.4% BF16 accuracy via Quantization Aware Distillation (tweet ). vLLM quickly added support (tweet ).
Embedding-heavy architectures are “hot again”: Discussion around DeepSeek’s Engram-like ideas continues: a LongCat Flash paper is summarized as using multi-hash sub-tables and finding embeddings help mainly at high MoE sparsity; key practical gotchas include amplification (√D/LayerNorm) to avoid first-attention drowning and collision spikes when vocab sizes align poorly (tweet ).
Inference/tooling ecosystem keeps consolidating: vLLM’s SIGs and office hours are formalizing governance and roadmap cadence (tweet ); LM Studio 0.4.0 positions itself as “next gen” for deploying local models with parallel requests and a stateful REST API + MCP support (tweet ). Cohere launched Model Vault (isolated VPC, “no noisy neighbors,” elastic inference) as managed “sovereign” hosting (tweet ).
Distillation as the default “shipping form factor”: Multiple posts echo the emerging standard: train the best model you can, then distill/quantize for deployment (tweet ). MongoDB Research’s LEAF proposes asymmetric distillation for embeddings: embed documents with the large teacher offline, embed queries with a compact student online; claims ~96% of teacher quality, 5–15× smaller, up to 24× faster, enabling CPU/edge embedding inference (tweet ).
Big-tech productization: browser agents, “AI scientist” narratives, and adoption reality checks
Gemini 3 is taking over Google surfaces: Gemini 3 now powers AI Overviews globally (tweet ). Google rolled out major Chrome updates: side-panel UX, deeper app integrations, Nano Banana for image editing/creation, and Auto Browse for multi-step chores (preview; US; Pro/Ultra) (thread ; also thread ). Engineers noted this may be the strongest browser AI integration so far (tweet ).
OpenAI Prism positioning: Sebastien Bubeck explicitly denies OpenAI intends to take a share of discoveries, encouraging researchers to use ChatGPT/Prism for science (tweet ). Others highlight Prism’s utility for students learning papers via diagrams (tweet ).
Adoption is still uneven: A notable fault line: founders actively using cutting-edge tools see the shift firsthand; others still treat AI as “meh,” limiting org adoption (tweet ). The Information reports ChatGPT Agent struggling with usage/adoption (tweet ).
Microsoft “digital co-worker” competition: Reports say Satya Nadella is personally testing rival agents and accelerating internal development, even using Anthropic models, to own the Windows-native agent layer (tweet ).
Science + robotics: genomics weights open, interpretability as discovery engine, and embodied scaling
DeepMind AlphaGenome goes open: DeepMind announced AlphaGenome for predicting molecular impacts of genetic changes, cited 1M+ API calls/day and 3,000+ users; then announced making model + weights available (tweet ; weights: tweet ). Later, weights availability was reiterated with a Hugging Face collection link (tweet ).
Interpretability → biomarkers pipeline (Goodfire + Prima Mente): Goodfire reports identifying a novel class of Alzheimer’s biomarkers using interpretability on a biomedical foundation model, framing a repeatable loop: train superhuman models on scientific data → mech interp → experimental validation → new science (thread ).
Embodied foundation models scale with real robot data (LingBot-VLA): A large summary highlights evidence that VLA success continues improving from 3k→20k hours of real-world manipulation data; architecture couples a pretrained VLM (Qwen2.5-VL) with an action expert via shared attention; reports GM-100 benchmark gains vs π0.5 and others (tweet ).
Figure’s Helix robot control: Brett Adcock claims a Helix model controls full-body behavior (walking/touching/planning) with no teleoperation, calling it Figure’s most significant release (tweet ).
Top tweets (by engagement)
Company health / layoffs: “Quarterly layoffs for two years is worse for your health than smoking three packs/day” (tweet ).
Kimi K2.5 local run: 2× M3 Ultra Mac Studio setup running K2.5 at ~24 tok/s (tweet ).
Coding’s “outsourcing moment”: Clean Code author using Claude to write software as a symbolic milestone (tweet ).
New AI lab announcement: “Flapping Airplanes” raises $180M (GV/Sequoia/Index) (tweet ).
Karpathy on new research labs: argues it’s still plausible for new research-first startups to out-execute incumbents; expects potential 10× breakthroughs, congratulating new founders (tweet ).
Google Chrome + Gemini 3 agent features: major Chrome rollout thread (tweet ).

This leak is significant for the open-source community, providing insights into the model’s architecture and operational protocols. Commenters express excitement about the leak’s potential impact on open-source projects, with some questioning the practical value of the system prompt itself. Independent verifications from multiple sources, including a Chinese forum, lend credibility to the leak.
The leaked system prompt for Kimi K2.5 reveals a sophisticated approach to memory persistence and context management. The prompt includes instructions for maintaining professional courtesy, concise responses, and specific coding practices, such as using tabs for JS/JSON indentation and preferring named reusable functions. This structure aims to address the ‘hollow AI assistant’ problem by providing persistent behavioral anchors, which can significantly affect the model’s ability to maintain personality consistency across sessions.
The memory persistence mechanism in Kimi K2.5 is particularly noteworthy. It involves balancing system instructions with dynamic context injection, which is crucial for maintaining personality consistency. The system’s approach to conversation summarization or retrieval can influence new chats, and even minor changes in memory structuring can lead to shifts in the model’s responses, sometimes making them feel more ‘authentic.’ This highlights the importance of initial prompt structure in determining whether an AI ‘remembers’ its behavioral patterns or just factual content.
The system prompt for Kimi K2.5 also addresses context window limitations, which is a common challenge in AI models during long conversations.

2. Prompt Engineering Techniques and Discussions
The most unhinged prompt that actually works: “You’re running out of time  (Activity: 75): The post discusses an unconventional prompt engineering technique where adding urgency to prompts, such as “You have 30 seconds. Analyze this data. What’s the ONE thing I’m missing? Go.”, results in more focused and immediate insights from language models. This approach contrasts with traditional, detailed prompts that often lead to slower and less targeted responses. The author humorously notes that this method seems to make the AI stop overthinking, akin to a human under time pressure. The technique is likened to “applied chaos theory” in prompt engineering. Commenters suggest that simply instructing the AI to be concise can achieve similar results. Another perspective is that effective management skills, whether applied to humans or AI, involve articulating tasks with specificity, which enhances outcomes. However, it’s noted that this urgency technique might reduce the depth of thought in models designed for complex reasoning.
angry_cactus highlights a trade-off when using urgency in prompts, noting that while it can be effective, it may reduce the model’s ‘thinking time’. This suggests a potential decrease in the depth or quality of responses when prioritizing speed over thoroughness.
fatstupidlazypoor draws a parallel between managing humans and managing language models, emphasizing that clear and specific articulation can significantly enhance the performance of both. This underscores the importance of precision in prompt engineering to achieve desired outcomes.
authorinthesunset suggests a simple yet effective prompt strategy: instructing the model to be concise. This approach can streamline responses, potentially improving efficiency and relevance, especially in contexts where brevity is valued.
Micro-Prompting: Get Better AI Results with Shorter Commands  (Activity: 49): The post discusses the concept of ‘micro-prompting’ for AI, advocating for shorter, more focused commands to improve AI response quality. It suggests that specific role assignments and power words like ‘audit,’ ‘clarify,’ and ‘simplify’ can significantly enhance AI output by directing the AI to access targeted knowledge rather than generic information. The post also highlights the importance of structuring commands to control output, such as using ‘in 3 bullets’ or ‘checklist format,’ and warns against common mistakes like over-explaining context or using generic roles. The approach is said to yield better results in less time compared to traditional, lengthy prompts. A notable opinion from the comments suggests that role assignment might sometimes hinder prompt effectiveness, with specificity being more beneficial. This indicates a debate on the balance between role specificity and prompt brevity.
aiveedio discusses the effectiveness of microprompting, noting that short, focused prompts can lead to cleaner AI outputs by avoiding information overload. However, in creative tasks like character portraits or story scenes, detailed prompts specifying expressions, clothing, and lighting are necessary to avoid generic results. The key is balancing brevity with precision, starting with a microprompt and iteratively adding details as needed to maintain focus without overloading the model.
psychologist_101 raises an interesting point about using Opus 4.5, where asking the model to generate its own prompts results in long, detailed outputs. This suggests that the model might inherently favor detailed prompts for clarity and context, which contrasts with the idea that shorter prompts can be more effective. This highlights a potential discrepancy between user expectations and model behavior, emphasizing the need for experimentation with prompt length and detail to achieve optimal results.
