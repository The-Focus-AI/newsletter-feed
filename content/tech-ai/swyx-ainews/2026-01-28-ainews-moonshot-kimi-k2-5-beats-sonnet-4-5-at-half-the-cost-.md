Kimi has been on an absolute tear in the past year [ http://China takes another huge leap ahead in open models ], and we last heard from them in November with Kimi K2 Thinking . Like K2, today’s K2.5 is still a 32B active-1T param model (384 experts), “built through continual pretraining on 15 trillion mixed visual and text tokens atop Kimi-K2-Base”  (which itself was on 15T tokens), and with an EXTREMELY well produced video from their founder (3 minutes, just watch it):
They again claim SOTA on HLE and BrowseComp (footnotes  give confidence the tests are legit), but also open model SOTA for vision and coding tasks:
There are a few notables here - Kimi K2.5 is “natively multimodal” for the first time, perhaps borrowing from Kimi VL , but is attributed to “massive-scale vision-text joint pre-training” including VIDEO understanding - “simply upload a screen recording” and K2.5 can reconstruct the website for you:
The fact that this is a continued pretrain that changes arch (+400M param MoonViT  vision encoder) is VERY exciting for model training folks who rarely get to see a scaled up model do stuff like this.
The other 2 headline features are equally exciting: Agent Swarm (only for paid users on the Kimi app) which “learns to self-direct an agent swarm of up to 100 sub-agents, executing parallel workflows across up to 1,500 coordinated steps, without predefined roles or hand-crafted workflows. ” This parallelism results in higher end result performance with up to 4.5x faster speed… ignoring token cost of course.
and “Office Productivity” with K2.5 Agent focused on “high-density, large-scale office work end to end”.
This is not empty regurgitation - We saw enough to sign up as a paying subscriber of the Kimi App going forward. As Artificial Analysis notes , the China-Western gap in open models just took another big leap today.
AI Twitter Recap
MoonshotAI’s Kimi K2.5 ecosystem: open multimodal MoE + “Agent Swarm” push
Kimi K2.5 model drop and positioning: Moonshot positions Kimi K2.5 as a flagship open-weights model with native multimodality (image + video), strong agentic performance, and aggressive API pricing/latency claims. Official launch media and messaging: founder intro video , pricing/throughput claims incl. “Turbo-level speed 60–100 tok/s” , plus early community reactions emphasizing “agent swarm” and multimodal capability (kimmonismus , kimmonismus on multimodal/video ).
Technical gist (as surfaced by the community): A useful unpacking of K2.5’s reported ingredients—~15T mixed visual+text tokens continual pretraining, context 128K→256K via YaRN, release in INT4 with selective quantization (only routed experts quantized), and the “Agent Swarm” orchestration concept (dynamic generation of subagents; up to 100 parallel subagents / 1,500 steps; wall-time improvements claimed 3–4.5×) is summarized by @TheZachMueller  (and points to the technical report ).
Benchmarks/third-party eval framing: Artificial Analysis positions K2.5 as “leading open weights” and closer to frontier labs, highlighting GDPval-AA Elo 1309 (agentic knowledge work harness), MMMU Pro 75%, INT4 ~595GB, and a 64% hallucination rate (improved vs K2 Thinking) among other stats: @ArtificialAnlys . LMArena announcements also place K2.5 Thinking at #1 open model in their Text Arena snapshot: @arena . (Treat leaderboards as point-in-time; harness/tooling and prompting matter.)
Distribution and “runs at home” signals: K2.5 landed quickly across infra surfaces: Ollama cloud with launch integrations (@ollama ), Together AI listing (@togethercompute ), and Fireworks as a partner (Moonshot ). A notable local-inference datapoint: K2.5 reportedly runs (slowly but “usable”) on 2× M3 Ultra via MLX with sharded generation, ~21.9 tok/s at high memory use: @awnihannun  (+ command snippet here ).
Product surface area around Kimi: Moonshot also pushed adjacent tooling: Kimi Code, an Apache-2.0 open-source coding agent integrating with common IDEs/editors (announcement ), and an Agent SDK to build custom agents (link ). A “Kimi Product” account is explicitly aimed at distributing prompts/use-cases (launch ), with a viral demo of “video-to-code” website cloning (demo ).
Open “American comeback” at scale: Arcee/Prime Intellect Trinity Large Preview (400B MoE)
Trinity Large Preview release: Arcee dropped Trinity Large initial weights as a “preview” release: @arcee_ai , with expanded details from @latkins . Prime Intellect frames it as an open 400B MoE with 13B active trained with Datology data: @PrimeIntellect . OpenRouter offered limited-time free access: @OpenRouterAI .
Architecture/training details (most concrete technical tweet): A strong technical snapshot comes from @samsja19 : 400B/A13B MoE, trained over 17T tokens; 3:1 interleaved local/global gated attention, SWA, NoPE on global layers + RoPE on local layers (as written in tweet), depth-scaled sandwich norm, sigmoid routing, trained with Muon; trained on ~2,000 B300s for a month on Prime Intellect infra, with data curation by DatologyAI.
Data scaling emphasis: Datology’s involvement is highlighted as a major part of the project: “6.5T tokens overall” and “800B synthetic code” (plus multilingual curation) in one team member’s recap: @code_star . Separate recaps mention 8T synthetic as part of 17T: @pratyushmaini .
Ecosystem readiness: vLLM announced day-0 support for serving Trinity Large: @vllm_project . The meta-story in the replies is that a Western org is again attempting frontier-ish pretraining from scratch with an open model, rather than only post-training/evals.
Agents everywhere: orchestration, subagents, planning critics, and IDE/CLI integration
Agent “swarm” vs “subagents” convergence: Kimi’s “Agent Swarm” pitch (dynamic subagent creation) parallels the broader pattern of central orchestrator + parallel specialists. The most explicit “starter pattern” articulation is LangChain’s stateless subagent model (parallel execution + minimized context bloat): @sydneyrunkle . Meanwhile, Kimi’s swarm is framed as trainable orchestration via Parallel-Agent RL (PARL) in community summaries (Zach Mueller ).
Reliability via “critique before execute”: Google’s Jules introduced a Planning Critic—a second agent that critiques plans pre-execution, claiming a 9.5% drop in task failure rates: @julesagent . Jules also added “Suggested Tasks” for proactive optimizations: @julesagent .
Coding-agent products intensifying: Mistral shipped Vibe 2.0 upgrades (subagents, user-defined agents, skills/slash commands, and paid plans): @mistralvibe  and @qtnx_ . MiniMax launched an “Agent Desktop” workspace pitched as more polished than Claude Cowork: @omarsar0  (and MiniMax’s own onboarding automation: @MiniMax_AI ).
IDE infrastructure and retrieval: Cursor claims semantic search materially improves coding-agent performance and that indexing for large codebases is “orders of magnitude faster”: @cursor_ai . VS Code continues tightening agent UX (e.g., safer command execution explanations): @aerezk , plus MCP servers returning UI via MCP Apps spec (LIFX control panel example): @burkeholland .
Document AI & multimodal systems: DeepSeek-OCR 2 and “Agentic Vision”
DeepSeek-OCR 2: learned reading order + token compression: DeepSeek-OCR 2 is framed as a shift from fixed raster scans to learned Visual Causal Flow with DeepEncoder V2, including 16× visual token compression (256–1120 tokens/image) and 91.09% OmniDocBench v1.5 (+3.73%); vLLM shipped day-0 support: @vllm_project . Unsloth notes similar headline improvements: @danielhanchen .
Mechanistic intuition (why it matters for pipelines): Jerry Liu provides a clear “why learned order helps” explanation: avoid semantically shredding tables/forms by allowing query tokens to attend to contiguous regions instead of strict left-to-right: @jerryjliu0 . Teortaxes adds a pragmatic eval take: OCR 2 is “on par with dots.ocr” and “nowhere near SOTA,” but the ideas may influence later multimodal products: @teortaxesTex .
Gemini “Agentic Vision” = vision + code execution loop: Google is productizing a “Think, Act, Observe” loop where the model writes/executes Python to crop/zoom/annotate images, claiming 5–10% quality boosts across many vision benchmarks: @_philschmid  and the official thread: @GoogleAI . This is an explicit move toward tool-augmented vision being first-class, not bolted on.
AI for science & research workflows: OpenAI Prism as “Overleaf with AI”
Prism launch: OpenAI introduced Prism, a free “AI-native workspace for scientists” powered by GPT-5.2, positioned as a unified LaTeX collaboration environment: @OpenAI  and @kevinweil . Community summaries frame it as “Overleaf with AI” (proofreading, citations, literature search): @scaling01 .
Data/IP clarification: Kevin Weil clarified that Prism follows your ChatGPT data controls and that OpenAI is not taking a share of individual discoveries; any IP-alignment deals would be bespoke for large orgs: @kevinweil .
Why it matters technically: Prism is a product bet that collaboration context + tool integration (LaTeX, citations, project state) becomes a durable advantage—mirroring the “context > intelligence” theme circulating in Chinese discussions about OpenAI infra and org design: @ZhihuFrontier .
Research notes & benchmarks worth tracking (RL, planning, multilingual scaling)
Long-horizon planning benchmark: DeepPlanning proposes verifiable-constraint planning tasks (multi-day travel, shopping) and reports frontier agents still struggle; emphasizes explicit reasoning patterns and parallel tool use: @iScienceLuvr . (This pairs nicely with the “travel planning again” meme: @teortaxesTex .)
RL efficiency and reuse of traces: PrefixRL idea—condition on off-policy prefixes to speed RL on hard reasoning, claiming 2× faster to same reward vs strong baseline: @iScienceLuvr .
Multilingual scaling laws: Google Research announced ATLAS scaling laws for massively multilingual LMs with data-driven guidance on balancing data mix vs model size: @GoogleResearch .
Math research reality check: Epoch’s FrontierMath: Open Problems benchmark invites attempts; “AI hasn’t solved any of these yet”: @EpochAIResearch .
