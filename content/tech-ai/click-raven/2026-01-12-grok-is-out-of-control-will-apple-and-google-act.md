## Apple and Google Are Letting X Break App Store Rules

**The What**
An opinion piece on [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/policy/859902/apple-google-run-by-cowards) by Elizabeth Lopatto says **Apple** and **Google** are not enforcing their own app-store policies against **X**, where users have used the AI tool **Grok** to create non-consensual sexual deepfake images, including of minors.

Countries like India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Britain, and France have even [threatened](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/x-formerly-twitter-faces-bans-due-to-ai-generated-grok-sexualized-images/809179/) to ban X in their countries.

**They Why**
Despite clear policy violations, X remains in both app stores. The article argues Apple and Google are avoiding action because of the political and economic influence of **Elon Musk** and his ties to **Donald Trump**.

**Takeaway**
If app-store rules aren’t enforced when it matters most, Big Tech’s claims about safety and user protection lose credibility.

## 3 Digital Marketing Trends That Will Shape 2026

In his latest analysis, Andrew Hutchinson outlines how digital marketing is set to evolve in 2026, driven by shifting user behavior, new platforms, and growing backlash against automation.

* **First**, **short-form video:** remains the dominant attention format. Platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts now account for the majority of time spent on social apps, reinforcing the need for brands to prioritize vertical video in both organic content and ads.

* **Second**, **augmented reality (AR):** is moving from experimentation to real adoption. With consumer-ready AR glasses expected to launch this year. Lled by Snap and followed closely by Meta. Marketers will soon have entirely new, location-aware ways to reach users.

* **Third**, **platform dynamics are shifting**, with Threads poised to overtake X, while Reddit risks being diluted by aggressive brand participation driven by AI search visibility.

These are just three of **seven key trends** shaping digital marketing in 2026.

## Google Gemini Is Gaining Ground as ChatGPT’s Web Traffic Slips

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f1d2aeb3-0e3f-4467-a743-62e07b0c615c/image.png?t=1768072943)

**What happened**
According to Similarweb’s January 2026 Global AI Tracker, **ChatGPT** now accounts for **64.5%** of global web traffic to generative AI chatbot sites, down sharply from **86% a year ago**.

Meanwhile, **Google Gemini** has surged to **21.5%**, up from just 5% last year. Over the past 12 weeks alone, Gemini’s visits rose **49%**, while ChatGPT’s fell **22%**.

**Why it matters**
The data suggests user attention is spreading beyond ChatGPT, especially at the web level. 

Google’s ability to bundle Gemini into Android and Workspace appears to be accelerating adoption, while standalone writing tools are losing relevance as users consolidate into general-purpose assistants.

**When this shift showed up**
The decline became more visible during the recent 12-week period, though Similarweb notes that winter holidays reduced overall traffic across the category.

**How to read the data**
These figures track **direct website visits only**, not API usage or in-app assistants.

**The takeaway: **web-based AI discovery is diversifying, even if total AI usage continues to grow elsewhere.

## Google Shows Fewer AI Overviews When Users Don’t Engage

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/e7ff0a38-1e35-4ffc-b0ab-b5e01248a58d/image.png?t=1768073056)

**What’s happening**
Google says AI Overviews don’t appear by default in Search.

According to Robby Stein, Google actively reduces AI Overviews for query types where users don’t click, engage, or find them useful.

If people consistently ignore an Overview, the system learns and stops showing it for those searches.

**Why it matters**
This explains why AI Overview visibility can fluctuate without any clear algorithm update. 

The presence (or absence) of Overviews often reflects user behavior, not ranking changes. It also clarifies why some informational queries still trigger Overviews while navigational or image-heavy searches (like athlete names) often don’t.

**How the system works**
Google sometimes runs **“under the hood” expanded queries** beyond what users type, pulling in related context and sub-answers. 

That’s why pages can appear in AI citations even without matching exact keywords. 

Personalization exists, but Google says it’s intentionally limited to keep results consistent across users.

## Google Warns Against “Chunking” Content for AI Visibility

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/4a3be948-c2e2-48a7-bd0c-0f731319fc47/image.png?t=1768073123)
Caption: 

**What’s happening**
Google says publishers **should not rewrite content into bite-sized chunks** just to appeal to AI Overviews or large language models (LLMs). 

Speaking on the Search Off the Record podcast, Danny Sullivan said Google explicitly does not want creators producing LLM-optimized versions of their content.

**Why Google is pushing back**
While chunked content may appear to work in some edge cases today, Sullivan warned that any gains will be temporary.

As Google’s ranking systems evolve, they will continue to prioritize content written for humans, not formats designed to “please” AI systems.

Tactics aimed at gaming LLM behavior are unlikely to hold up long term.

**What this means for publishers**
Google’s message is consistent: don’t split your strategy into “AI content” and “human content.”

Focus on clarity, usefulness, and audience value. Short-term AI visibility hacks may fade, but content built for humans is what Google expects to reward over time.
