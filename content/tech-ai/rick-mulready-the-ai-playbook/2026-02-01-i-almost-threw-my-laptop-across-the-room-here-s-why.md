# I almost threw my laptop across the room (here's why)

Hey, it's Rick!



Last Friday morning, I sat down to write this newsletter using
the workflow I'd built the previous week in Claude Code.



I was on my second coffee (or third?) and was pumped to dive in.



The week before, I'd spent hours building out my newsletter
system.



It pulled themes from my Q&A transcripts and notes from
throughout the week, gave me a solid outline.



The outline it gave me that first week was awesome. The workflow
took just minutes to run once it was built.



So Friday rolls around, I fire up the same workflow, and...



The output was terrible.



It was like Claude and I'd never talked before.



☕☕☕



I spent the next couple hours trying to fix it.



Revising instructions.



Trying different prompts.



Going in circles.



Same workflow I'd built and worked so well the previous week.
Same files. Same AI. Completely different results.



I honestly wanted to throw my laptop across the room.



Finally, I just closed it and walked away.





And then it hit me.



AI isn't inconsistent. I was. My system was broken.



The AI was doing exactly what I asked.



But I'd missed something in the system/workflow I created.



Your AI isn't broken. Your system you created to accomplish your
task is.
-----------------------------------------------------------------





So I audited the system. Looked at every step, read through all
the instructions, checked the context files and examples.



Here's what I found:



My instructions weren't clear enough about which examples to
model. The specific newsletter structure I wanted wasn't
well-defined.



The AI was being consistent. My system wasn't.



So I decided to have Claude interview me. What did I actually
want this newsletter to sound like? What structure? What tone?
What context did it need access to?



Then we cross-referenced those answers against my existing
instructions. Updated every mismatch. One step at a time.



Now it works. Every Friday, same workflow, consistently good
output.



No more laptop-throwing urges.



No more circling.



Just results.



It's not the AI. It's the system you created.

When your outputs are inconsistent, something in your setup
is broken:

• Instructions aren't specific enough

• Context is missing or wrong

• Steps are out of order

• Examples don't match expectations

• Constraints aren't defined





---------------------------------------------------
Here's what this actually looks like in practice...
---------------------------------------------------



Every week, I run a Claude Cowork prompt that generates my
content ideas for YouTube, this newsletter, my AI Playbook
Community (
https://13a5ec89.click.convertkit-mail4.com/gku7228409b5hlgvqnxhrh8eele99c8xne5k84x07vxdmnzd5d9pm29vqxplonedvorx78nwwl0vzoon6xzkm9e8k4gk39ovn94r6nr770m69dornr3oro2vm65a2z9m/g3hkkdk7fwumgw5n9ph3/aHR0cHM6Ly9yaWNrbXVscmVhZHkuY29tL3Nrb29sLW5ld3NsZXR0ZXItMg==
), social content.





It's not about clever prompting. It's about system architecture.


Real example from my workflow:

I have a Google Sheet that tracks daily what new members want
from my Community (their "Top 3 Things" I call it).



I also have a content memory directory with all my past
newsletters.



I give Claude Cowork access to both.



Then I run a simple prompt:



Analyze member feedback patterns in my 3 Things Google
Sheet.

Generate the following:

• 5 email ideas

• 5 YouTube video ideas

• 5 community content ideas

• 15 short form content ideas

• 3 LinkedIn content ideas

Check Content_Recommendations_Tracker.json first, do not
duplicate past recommendations.

Add new batch with today's date.

Here's the path to the Google Sheet: [PATH]



That's it. The system handles the rest.



It works because it has memory (prevents repetition), clear
inputs (the Sheet + directory), and defined constraints (no
duplicates).



Same principle works for you too:



Give AI access to your inputs (customer feedback, past work,
preferences) + memory of what you've already created +
constraints on what you don't want repeated.














And of course, you're never simply copy/pasting the output AI
writes for you and publishing.



Once AI does it's work, then you get to personalize and customize
it to you.



I see this pattern constantly in my community.
----------------------------------------------



Someone builds an AI workflow that works once, then mysteriously
stops working.



And they blame the AI.



If your results vary, something's missing from the workflow you
created, or was incomplete from the start.





The question isn't "Why isn't AI working?" It's "What's missing
in the system I created?"


When your AI workflow isn't working, audit these six things:



AI Workflow Diagnostic Checklist:

• Instructions: Are they specific enough? Do they include
examples of "good"?

• Context: What files or data are you providing? Is
anything missing or outdated?

• Steps: Are they in the right order? Any unnecessary
steps?

• Examples: Have you shown the AI what success looks
like?

• Constraints: Have you defined what you DON'T want?

• Memory: Does the AI have access to previous context it
needs?

This checklist will help you discover exactly what to audit.



And if you want my help, that's one thing my AI Playbook

One Month In...
Are Your 2026 Goals Already Slipping?
-------------------------------------

Most people abandon their goals by February. Not because they
lack motivation - because they lack a system.

You consumed content to improve. You took notes. But when you
needed that insight most? Nowhere to find it.

Recall users are different. They're building knowledge that
compounds:

* Every podcast becomes actionable: AI summaries turn 90-minute
episodes into 5-minute insights you can actually use.
* Your past work informs your future: "Show me everything I've
saved about email marketing + my Q4 campaign notes." Instant
strategy session.
* Learning sticks: Spaced repetition and AI quizzes turn
consumption into retention. You remember what matters.
* Connections you'd never see: The knowledge graph surfaces
patterns across months of saved content automatically.

The difference between those who hit their 2026 goals and those
who don't? A system that makes knowledge stick.

COMMUNITY USE CASES 💡

Sometimes the best ideas come from seeing what others are doing.
Here are some wins from our AIP members over the last week.



* Prerna built an AI automation in Relay.app that helps her
clients get better, more personalized results in minutes -- for
pennies.


* Alan used AI last week to create a super useful tool for one of
his clients to use on a product launch. The tool provides the
client both stress-free planning and solid data for future
projects.

* Shelly leveraged AI to create targeted sales emails for her
farm business focusing on clearing freezer inventory and
increasing cash flow.

* Laura built a resource in Notion she calls the Chat Extractor
Kit that transforms endless AI conversations into structured
strategy templates, turning chaotic idea dumps into organized
insights fast.

* Adriana automated her client onboarding documentation using
Notion AI to create SOPs and checklists, making a tedious manual
process into a streamlined system.

* Joni created a Claude Skill loaded with book PDFs related to
her coaching topics. The Skill will now save her a ton of time,
give her access to consistent knowledge files (without her having
to think about it) wherever she is having conversations in
Claude, while also reducing token costs.

* Nancy transformed her coaching practice organization using
NotebookLM for tracking client progress, planning conversations,
condensing educational materials, and creating post-session
visuals.
