Hey, it's Rick!



I was doing a podcast interview recently and the topic of AI and
business data came up.



One of the hosts was sharing how their students, who are
short-term rental owners, have access to every metric Airbnb
tracks: Occupancy, Revenue, Booking windows, Guest ratings, etc.



It's all right there in their dashboard. But most of the students
feel super overwhelmed when it comes to numbers.



These aren't hobbyists. The students are business owners with
properties generating actual revenue.



And they're stuck by data they’re not sure how to interpret.



I see the same thing happening with a lot of people when they
come into my AI Playbook community (
https://13a5ec89.click.convertkit-mail4.com/lmuroo6xnqtmhnqwowzb6h8kxn400i58veon5l892d8qgvmqoqkxg0kd38x64veqd4z825vpp69dm44v78mngke5nlwnrk4dvklz7vz229g7kq4zvzr4z40dg7os297q/g3hk5kzvbwumgo567rf3/aHR0cHM6Ly9yaWNrbXVscmVhZHkuY29tL3Nrb29sLW5ld3NsZXR0ZXItMg==
). You've got things like:



* You've got Google Analytics tracking your site traffic.
* Kajabi or whatever platform showing your course completion
rates.
* Stripe telling you revenue numbers.
* Email open rates in your email CRM.
* Maybe you're even tracking it all in a spreadsheet or Notion.



But what does it actually mean?



And more importantly, what should you be focusing on to grow your
business?



---------------------------
What's In Today's Playbook:
---------------------------



* Why your business data is sitting there telling you exactly
what to fix (and you're missing it)
* The 3-minute AI play that turns dashboard overwhelm into clear
action steps
* How to stop fixing random things and let your numbers guide you



Here's the approach I shared with the podcast hosts for their
students…



The first question to ask is:



What do you actually want to know from all these numbers?



Students were looking at their dashboard every month. Exporting
reports. Feeling overwhelmed.



But they'd never asked themselves what they were trying to learn
from the numbers.



This is the part most people skip.



We collect data because we're told we should.



We glance at it.



We feel bad when numbers are down and good when they're up. But
we're not actually using it to make strategic decisions.



Here's what I recommended they have their students try...



They screenshot their dashboard and drop it into Claude with an
overly-simple prompt:



I own a short-term rental property. Act as a Small
Business Financial Analyst and analyze my monthly stats.

Based on your analysis, tell me what’s costing me the most right
now in my business. What’s my biggest bottleneck?

My stats: [the stats go here]



The AI comes back in a matter of seconds:





I own a short-term rental property. Act as a Small
Business Financial Analyst and analyze my monthly stats. Based on
your analysis, tell me what’s costing me the most right now in my
business. What’s my biggest bottleneck?

Stats: [the stats go here]

Your problem isn't guest experience. Your 4.9-star rating
proves that's working. Your occupancy is 62% when competitors hit
78-82%. That's leaving $18,000 a year on the table, money you
were about to spend on a bathroom that didn't need fixing.

You need visibility, not renovations



That's the shift.



They were about to spend money renovating the bathroom and
upgrading the coffee maker (which I’m all for, good coffee
matters after all).



Why?



Because when you don't know what the actual problem is, you just
start fixing random things and hoping something works.



Let the data dictate what your next steps are. And let AI help
you figure it out.
-----------------------------------------------------------------



I see this pattern a lot in my community.



Someone's got a course with great completion rates, awesome
testimonials, and students that get great results.



But sales are flat, and they're starting to wonder if they should
create a whole new offer.



So what do they do?



They start adding bonus content, creating more resources, stuff
like that.



But if the data showed you that 10,000 people visited your sales
page last month and only 14 bought...



Your problem isn't the course.



It's getting more qualified traffic to the page. Or it's your
positioning. Or your pricing strategy.



The course itself is working fine.



But you won't know that unless you actually look at what the data
is telling you.



And here's the thing, you probably KNOW your sales are flat.



You've been staring at that number for months.



But knowing you have a problem isn't the same as knowing WHICH
problem to solve.



That's where most business owners spin their wheels.



Here's the AI strategy most people are missing:



You can’t have AI to do the work in your business until you know
what work needs to be done.


This is where AI becomes your business analyst instead of just
your task executor.



Towards the end of the podcast interview, I suggested the hosts
have their students (who are non-techy, btw) set up a simple GPT
in ChatGPT or Claude Project or Gemini Gem (same concept).



Give it instructions similar to what I shared above and then they
can feed their monthly stats to the GPT.



Every month, they screenshot their rental dashboard, drop it into
the GPT, and it gives them:



1. What's working that they should keep doing

2. What's the biggest bottleneck right now

3. The one thing to fix this month that moves the needle



Takes them three minutes.



No overwhelm.



No guessing.



Just clarity on what actually matters.



You're not asking AI to fix everything. You're asking it to find
your biggest bottleneck.



Your business has one bottleneck. AI can find it in 30 seconds.
Then you stop guessing and start growing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------



And here's where it gets interesting for you.



Many of the nearly 600 members in my Community came in thinking
they needed AI to execute things faster. Write emails quicker.
Repurpose content in half the time. Generate more ideas.



And of course, AI does all of that (really well).



But the strategic shift happens when you realize AI can also tell
you what's worth executing in the first place.



Because speed without direction is just doing the wrong things
faster.



You probably have data sitting in your business right now that
would tell you exactly where your bottleneck is.



You might be looking at the data every month. Maybe you're even
tracking it in a dashboard somewhere.



But are you asking it the right question?



Not "How do I get better at everything?"



But something like:



"Based on what's actually happening in my business right now,
what's the one thing I should focus on improving that will move
the needle most?"



Let AI help you interpret your stats and data, then use it to
tackle what needs the most attention in your business.



What data are you tracking that you wish you understood better?

P.S. - Inside my AI Playbook (AIP) Community we have a ready-made
"Business Bottleneck Analyzer" GPT + the exact prompt templates I
use monthly with my own business data.



We help you stop drowning in tools and start using AI where it
actually matters in YOUR business.

COMMUNITY USE CASES 💡
---------------------

Sometimes the best ideas come from seeing what others are doing.
Here are some wins from our AIP members over the last week.

* Alan used AI to teach college students storytelling skills
while maintaining creative integrity.

* Shelly strategized with my PickRick'sBrain coaching AI chatbot
on starting a YouTube Channel for her biz.

* Jamie is refining her Claude Project skills and is now using
Claude to refine her Claude prompts (meta!)

* Adriana has been using the Comet browser as a subject matter AI
expert when building out client dashboards in Notion. She opens
Notion in Comet, opens the AI assistant and when when she's stuck
just asks the AI in Comet to help her.

* Clif automated his iCloud organization using Claude Chat to
generate a complete folder index, then had Claude Cowork
instantly create the entire folder structure so fast he didn't
even see it happen.

* Colin built an automated content cannibalization checker that
transforms the previously manual and often-ignored SEO process
into an on-demand system to make client-work more efficient.

* Shene has been busy building custom ChatGPT prompts and GPTs
for her clients to help them do comprehensive analyses on heaps
of business files and documents saving them a ton of work and
time.
