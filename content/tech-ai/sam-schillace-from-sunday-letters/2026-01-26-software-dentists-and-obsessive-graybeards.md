I’ve been watching a lot of folks recently engage with Claude Code, Amplifier and other agentic tools. It’s been an intense experience, and I’ve started to notice some patterns emerging. I don’t know how well these will transfer to other uses and domains. Perhaps they are particular to programming. Though, as AI closes the gap between “thought” and “action”, the role software has taken for the past 40 years, everything is becoming software and programming, at some level. So, it’s still probably worth understanding even if you don’t make code for a living. 
One mode I’ve noticed, and experienced, centers around “gray beards” (which I consider myself to be): folks who came up in the 80’s and 90’s as programmers. For this cohort, programming was inherently fascinating and fun. The landscape we evolved in was messy, emerging, and hard to work with, so we all have “tinker’s skills”: we don’t mind wading in and figuring things out. 
This cohort is absolutely bananas right now - all of us are building like mad, having fun like we are kids again. For us, the new coding assistants are very much an assistant - they replace or augment the creaky parts of our brains that struggle with remembering nouns, details, specific syntax and so on - the annoying bits that you have to master (or used to) to build anything.
For most of us, programming gradually became less fun as it became harder with age. We still have the creativity, drive, and ideas - and now, the models can do the grind for us. It’s like all of this cohort are trying to do two decades of programming all at once. Perhaps we’ll burn ourselves out, but this is one of the most pure “AI as a cognitive assistant and aid” use cases I’ve seen - it’s really enabling a lot of creation that would otherwise not happen. 
There’s a younger cohort that I’m not as close to, but see a bit on my team: folks recently out of school. For them, the current moment is disruptive, but they have more tools to deal with it. When you are starting your career, you never have a clear path anyway, so they are well positioned to understand this landscape and do surprising things with it. When I was their age, old guys like me would say to avoid the PC, the mainframe was a “real computer”. I’m glad I didn’t listen - and that’s why I don’t think that group needs much of my advice. 
But there is a third group, that I call “software dentists” who I think are going to struggle. 
What’s a “software dentist”? If you came into the industry somewhere after the dot com crash and recovery - say 2005 to 2015 or so - software looked like a nice, easy, well-paid white collar job with a lot of stability. Like law, finance or medicine, but a bit easier per dollar and less icky in some ways, and easier to get into - the big tech companies were hiring like mad for a solid decade or more. 
But many of those folks don’t really like tech that much. Their job isn’t creative or exploratory like the gray beards or the new kids - it’s more “follow this complex set of instructions”. Unfortunately, there is less value to that now - models can easily do that kind of grind work. And many in this cohort jumped to management quickly because that was an even easier path to the lifestyle, without the hard technical work. 
I see these folks struggling right now. The folks who can bring energy and creativity to agentic coding are building at a more rapid pace than I’ve ever seen. I spent three days with my team at a hackathon. I have managed 500 person teams that were easier to keep track of than this group - I had to use the agent itself just to try to track down all they did. I personally started two major product projects, rebuilt a bunch of our tooling, built out and published new documentation, made new recipes from what did and didn’t work in the large projects, and designed our next major push with the help of agentic tools we built on the fly. And I was distracted! 
What I have seen in my long career as a technologist is the thing I used as the title of my book: there’s no real prize for being pessimistic. Change is uncomfortable for everyone, but it comes for us all. The best thing to do, particularly in a chaotic time like this, is bring our best, creative selves to the task at hand, with an open mind. 
There are amazing things to do now, tools we’ve never had, capabilities that used to be reserved for a few, now available for everyone. Don’t be a dentist!
