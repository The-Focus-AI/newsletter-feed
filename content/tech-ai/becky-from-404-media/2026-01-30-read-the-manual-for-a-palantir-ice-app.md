The week is over, and it's time to round up what the heck happened. On 404 Media, at least.

On the podcast this week [https://www.404media.co/r/7e3ce914?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410]: Why some creators believe a popular porn platform’s leadership may be experiencing ‘AI psychosis,’ and mysterious disappearing ICE footage. In the section for subscribers at the Supporter level, we talk about Flock and what police are being told to do: not describe what they’re using the AI cameras for.

SEE FOR YOURSELF

Earlier this month we revealed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is using a Palantir tool called ELITE to decide which neighborhoods to raid. The tool lets ICE populate a map with potential deportation targets, bring up dossiers on each person, and view an address “confidence score” based on data sourced from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other government agencies. This is according to a user guide for ELITE 404 Media obtained. 404 Media is now publishing a version of that user guide so people can read it for themselves.

PROBABLY FINE

Researchers are raising alarms [https://www.404media.co/r/f198bb4d?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] over “unexplained pauses” that have interrupted dozens of U.S. federal health surveillance databases covering vaccinations and overdose deaths during the second Trump administration. The breakdown is creating critical gaps in public health according to a study published on Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine. During 2025, nearly half (46 percent) of 82 routinely-updated databases managed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) experienced delays or total cessations of new data, an interdisciplinary team reports in their new audit. The majority (87 percent) of the affected databases monitor vaccination-related topics, and most experienced data blackouts for a period of more than six months as of late October 2025.

COPS TALKING TO COPS

Police officers are being told to “be as vague as permissible” [https://www.404media.co/r/57bfd5b6?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] about why they are using the Flock surveillance system in order to not leak sensitive information via public records requests, according to records obtained using a public records request. The warning originated from a Houston-area police intelligence center that includes members of the FBI and ICE and suggests without evidence that people are using a website called HaveIBeenFlocked.com to “potentially retaliate against law enforcement.”

HAND CHECK

An app that purports to help people stop consuming pornography [https://www.404media.co/r/1aa23b7b?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] has exposed highly sensitive data, including its users’ masturbation habits. Some of the data exposed includes the users’ age, how often they masturbate, and how viewing pornography makes them feel. According to the data, many of them are minors. An example of the personal data of one user said they were “14,” that their “frequency” of porn consumption was “several times a week,” with a maximum of three times a day, and that their “triggers” were “boredom” and “Sexual Urges.” This user was given a “dependence score” and listed their “symptoms” as “Feeling unmotivated, lack of ambition to pursue goals, difficulty concentrating, poor memory or ‘brain fog.’”

THE DOG ATE MY EVIDENCE

The Department of Homeland Security now says that two weeks of critical surveillance footage [https://www.404media.co/r/8b4fed61?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] from within Immigrations and Customs Enforcement’s Broadview detention center wasn’t actually lost in a “system crash,” but rather, was never recorded in the first place. It is also arguing that, had the footage been recorded, it would be irrelevant because prisoner living conditions have improved since the time it was supposed to be recorded. The filings, made by U.S. attorneys on behalf of Greg Bovino, Kristi Noem, and other DHS officials, are the latest in an ongoing class action lawsuit against the U.S. government filed by detainees at the Chicago-area ICE detention center.

This is Behind the Blog [https://www.404media.co/r/43121d00?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], where we share our behind-the-scenes thoughts about how a few of our top stories of the week came together. This week, we discuss a trip to Kenya, reconstructing images, and lying developers.

JASON: Last week, I was in Kenya, a trip that turned out so overwhelmingly positive and left me in such a good mood that I am still somehow a week still carrying with me. I was invited to give a presentation at a conference about how AI is changing journalism, and how journalists can navigate an age of disinformation, slop, and general chaos. 

It was a very small conference, with about 30 people, and everyone was incredibly interesting and cool; it was a mix of people who run independent newsrooms across Africa, Europe, and Asia, as well as human rights and nonprofit researcher types. At the conference itself, I met a lot of people who I hope we’ll be able to partner with in some way in the future.

We’ve been invited to participate in a few international journalism conferences and things of this nature over the last couple years and I have jumped at the opportunity whenever they come up. When I worked at VICE, I was invited to travel for work all the time, but I almost never got to do it, because leaving for any length of time was incredibly stressful because the company could and often did fall apart while I was gone (not because I was gone, but while I was gone), and I would have to deal with the fallout from some inconvenient time zone. I would also inevitably return to a pile of work to do that didn’t get done while I was gone, so I was basically traveling but trying to find time to do my normal job while I was traveling, which I think is probably a pretty common experience for people who travel for work. I said no to a lot of things I wanted to say yes to, and I think that it was probably the right thing to do at the time, but honestly it ingrained some sort of guilt or stress in me that I’m still trying to work through. I still feel guilty and stressed when I travel for work even though my colleagues are very supportive. But I’m still getting used to looking at “talk about journalism on a free trip to Kenya” as part of my job that I can simply enjoy and feel overwhelmingly lucky about.

The other thing, of course, is that last week and the last year in general has been an absolute shitshow in the United States, and so being lucky and privileged enough to leave it at all feels both like a million pound weight comes off my shoulders and like I am abdicating my duty as a journalist and as an American do be here and cover what’s going on. This felt especially bad when I saw the killing of Alex Pretti—there’s a bit of hopelessness and helplessness seeing something happen in your country and being on the other side of the world. The flip side of this is that taking a short break from the horrors is re-energizing and I guess, to use some annoying language, an act of self care. Not being fully immersed in the American news cycle for a week … I cannot explain how much it helped me emotionally. I feel more energized to do the work we do today than I have in months, I think in part because I was able to use a different part of my brain, go to a place I had never been before, and meet so many inspiring people from around the world. 

I mentioned back in September that I was asked to give a talk at a larger conference in Athens, and, at the time, a few people from places that have authoritarian governments, no First Amendment, and are generally precarious for journalists asked me how I was holding up reporting on the Trump administration. That was a whoa dude situation at the time and in Kenya, that was all dialed up a bit. People who have been reporting on government surveillance and crackdowns in Kenya, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and South Africa were telling me that what was happening in the United States is crazy, which, hard agree. There were also a lot of Germans there who were discussing how it took an incredibly long time for Germany to de-Nazify (and that of course it was not entirely 100 percent successful), and they said we are in for a very long road. Getting this perspective from other journalists in other countries feels very valuable to me, and I’m thankful for it. 

A few last things: One of the journalists I met in Kenya told me that four years ago, he and his friends began saving up for a road trip from Mexico to Canada for the World Cup, with the plan to see one game in each country. He told me that, obviously, because of the ICE crackdowns they said fuck this and are now going to Europe during the World Cup instead. This exact same calculus must be happening millions of times with millions of would-be tourists around the world. What a terrible, stupid own goal. Also, I did spend some time in Kenya actively reporting stories about data labelers and the people who train AI. There’s a huge industry of human workers in Kenya who work on content moderation, training AI, etc. It’s grueling, extremely underpaid work. The interviews I did were extremely harrowing; they’ll be showing up on the site sometime in the next week or two. 

Finally: I went to Kenya a few days early to go on safari. I did not know what to expect but it was incredible. Here are some pictures of animals I took, as a timeline cleanse:

EMANUEL: Getting out this story about exposed data in an app that aims to help people stop consuming pornography [https://www.404media.co/r/fddc7e0c?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] is one of the more frustrating reporting experiences I’ve had in a while. 

I’ve written many times in previous BTBs about the idea of “amplification” and making sure that our reporting never causes unnecessary harm to innocent people. Generally, I’ve talked about this idea in the context of covering nonconsensual content and other forms of bad, harmful content that people share online. The basic rule there is that we either wait until that content is removed before we publish a story, or we write about in a way that doesn’t point more people there. 

But that type of strategy dates back to our days of publishing stories about many hacks at Motherboard. If we learned about some devastating leak of personal information, or a vulnerability that allowed anyone to get that data, we didn’t report on it until after that vulnerability was fixed. This is how whitehat hackers and security researchers responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities they find as well. First they go to the company and tell it about the vulnerability, and then, sometimes, only after it's fixed, do they tell the press about it or make that discovery public. This way the public can learn from the incident without increasing risk to the users who were impacted by it. 

One reason hackers and security researchers often came to tell us about these vulnerabilities is that companies didn’t fix them after the hackers disclosed it to them directly. In most cases, once we know about the vulnerability and reach out to the company with questions indicating we’re about to publish a story, fear of public scrutiny drives them to fix the issue where a private disclosure from a single unknown hacker did not, which is another way reporting on these vulnerabilities can result in good impact. 

Very rarely, a hacker or researcher would come to us after a company failed to fix a vulnerability they disclosed to it directly, and the company would similarly ignore our questions and fail to fix the issue after we reached out. This has happened a few times, so it’s not a new experience for us, but it never fails to shock me. 

This is what happened with the porn quitting app I covered and it’s one of the worst examples of this situation I’ve seen. The data is incredibly damaging in the wrong hands, and I know for a fact that the developer of the app was aware of the problem and had all the information they needed to fix it, but didn’t. 

The other thing that happened while reporting this story that is pretty rare is that the developer blatantly lied to me directly. I talked to them over the phone and told him exactly how the app was compromised, that I know they had a conversation about it with the researcher, and that it’s still an active problem. They said the data was faked, that there is no security issue, and never was. 

It was such a definitive statement contradicting all the evidence I had that I had to pause for a moment and ask myself if I missed something. To confirm beyond a doubt that the vulnerability was still active, I immediately created an account on the app, and within minutes the researcher was able to show me my private data in that app. When I told this to the developer he no longer responded to my messages or picked up the phone. 

We really want to name the app and the developer because they deserve that accountability, and because users of that app deserve to know their data was at risk. It also would have made it a much wilder and more interesting story for reasons I hope to share when the vulnerability is finally fixed or the app is removed from the app store, making it safe to tell that story. For now, it isn’t, and we have to put those users’ safety first.

We did this for source protection reasons, rather than publishing the original document itself.

I don’t want to get into those reasons here, but talk more about the retyping of the guide and the reconstructing of the images. We’ve published retyped text before. We did that here [https://www.404media.co/r/4e08942c?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] about Palantir’s internal wiki justifying its work with ICE (I actually don’t love that headline now; at the time there was a lot of reporting coming from other outlets about a so-called master database. I’ve never heard that term myself from my own reporting, but it was more throwing to their coverage. I think it should have been more just about ‘this what Palantir says internally about its work with ICE’).

Way back at Motherboard, I got a big leak of Facebook content moderation documents. These were the basis of a ton of articles. Those ranged from Leaked Documents Show Facebook’s Struggles With Dick Pics [https://www.404media.co/r/9b3da7bf?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], to mine and Jason’s super indepth piece The Impossible Job: Inside Facebook’s Struggle to Moderate Two Billion People [https://www.404media.co/r/6bac1be2?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410]. For some of those articles, we wanted to publish the leaked materials so people could see them for themselves. But we didn’t want to jeopardize our source either. So, we reconstructed many of the slides, one by one. This involved me painstakingly typing each one. But it was worth it so people could see the material.

We did similar here with the ELITE guide, typing that up. But we went a step further and reconstructed images from the guide. Or rather, Evy did, who manages our socials and also saved the day by doing this.

It is very unusual to reconstruct images. I absolutely think that. To play the other side for a second: journalism is about showing people what is real, not some recreation of it. What is the value in making these images? And how do we know they’re real, when they’re not literally a screenshot of the document?

I hear all of that (because I just wrote it) but there’s a few things. Reconstructions are very useful journalistic tools. Imagine something like the visual analyses done by Bellingcat or the New York Times. Often they create diagrams to show where people are during a situation. Maybe they annotate footage with their own shapes and notes to explain to a reader what happened. Some, like Forensic Architecture [https://www.404media.co/r/735c248a?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], make entire computer-generated simulations of what happened. I see these images more like that.

I would always prefer if possible to publish the original stuff. That was one of the great things about the Snowden revelations. Because Snowden came forward as the source himself, to stop any speculation that it was really the Chinese, or the Russians, or whoever, there weren't really any source protection considerations around publication. Journalists could just publish the slides or documents so people could see them (after considering if they needed to do any redactions of things that weren’t in the public interest).

I don’t think reconstructing images like this should be the norm. It’s a pretty out there thing to do. I would always prefer to publish the original material, like we often do. But here it feels the story is so important—the technological infrastructure underpinning ICE’s mass deportation effort—that it was worth doing. Now members of the public, experts, immigration attorneys, government officials, anyone, can read through and see the guide for themselves. Maybe they pick up on stuff that didn’t make it into our original article.    

SAM: What is there to even say. I don’t have anything to add to the conversation at large that you probably aren’t already getting by reading our blogs or other trustworthy news outlets; the US government is arresting journalists [https://www.404media.co/r/258b74d1?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], the latest in a parade of disturbing and disgusting escalations of authoritarianism in this country. We all see it and I don’t want to pretend we don’t; it feels absurd to talk about anything else. I haven’t personally been covering things like Palantir and ICE apps because my colleagues have got it covered better than literally anyone in tech media right now, and I’m proud to be part of a newsroom with their expertise and care. But that doesn’t mean the things I’m covering are completely detached from what’s ultimately all part of the same story: the way power influences people, and all the ways the tech industry is responsible. 

In the last week and a half I’ve been talking a lot about ManyVids, a porn platform you might not have heard of before, but regardless, is massively popular and moves a lot of money in the adult industry. We talked about this on the podcast this week, but I first started noticing something odd happening on the ManyVids X account months ago, along with a lot of creators who have been replying “wtf?” to their AI-generated corpogoddess-speak posts since at least August. I kind of filed it away to quirky porn site stuff — the adult industry and its characters are wonderfully eclectic, after all — but it didn’t stop. And more people started noticing. And then, creators started DMing and emailing us about it. And a few weeks ago, people started noticing that the personal website of the platform’s “still standing” CEO changed to say she aims to transition sex workers out of the adult industry and wants to see no one else enter it. To be clear, this is SWERF [https://www.404media.co/r/f164176b?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] language and ideology: that sex workers need saving from themselves.

I’ve emailed ManyVids many times asking for the platform to be clear about if, when, and how the creators who made it a success will be affected by these apparent shifts in mission. So far, they’ve only doled out more nonsense slopified statements [https://www.404media.co/r/f79a2efe?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], or posted fantasies about being an astronaut, or fireman, or wished aloud they could go on conservative podcasters’ shows. But yesterday, ManyVids posted on X [https://www.404media.co/r/c0fb58b3?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] for the first time since September: three pages of Lisa Frank-style highlighter and coloring book scribbles on top of accusing an unnamed outlet of publishing hit pieces and being “connected to other industry players.” For the record, I don't know if this is a dig at 404 Media or someone else. It’s three pages that still answer or account for nothing.

Since these statements are kind of hard to read due to being stylized to look like a middle schooler made them, here’s the text in full:   

"ManyVids is an incredibly disruptive company. We don't accept the status quo, and we are not afraid of voicing injustice. MV is currently leading a second revolution in the adult industry-for the second time in 12 years-and our actions are making waves. At ManyVids, we began integrating Al into our internal workflows over two years ago, and it quickly became clear that this technology would play an important role in achieving our mission, driven by a very clear vision. At MV, Al is primarily a tool for efficiency, not a replacement for creativity, which is crucial to delivering an exceptional, multi-layered, one-stop-shop platform. When it comes to Al-generated or Al-assisted content on the platform, less than 0.38% of all content (from approximately 67 Al creator profiles) is Al, and it is clearly labeled in its own category. Those creators must follow the same strict Trust & Safety, age-verification, co-performer identification, and consent standards as all other creators on ManyVids. We have historically been among the strictest platforms in the industry when it comes to age verification, co-performer identification, and identity verification for content creators since day one. We have always taken strong public positions against platforms that were built on stolen content, impersonation, or non-consensual distribution. Those behaviors cause real harm, and that is precisely why ManyVids was created to bring better, safer, and more ethical options to a historically exploitative industry. Traffic-based adult platforms are becoming less viable under stricter age-verification and compliance regulations, which we fully support. It is quite clear that traditional traffic-based tube sites will not stand the test of time under those regulations. We believe the industry needs to start respecting its creators and move away from offering free, unregulated NSFW content, as we shared in a pinned post on our X account months ago. Requiring payment methods such as credit cards helps protect both consumers and content creators through stronger accountability and compliance. It is also important to say that ManyVids is a woman-led tech company in an industry that is dominated by men, for men. Our CEO, Bella French, intentionally stopped doing interviews almost five years ago and has not maintained personal social media for many years. The company's social presence has also been intentionally paused. Updates to her bio-for the first time in close to six months on her bellafrench.com website recently reflected long-term strategic positioning, not a sudden shift in direction. Those changes were not promoted anywhere and were intended for a business-focused audience to help our community grow. Within hours of making those edits, a negative article was published out of context by a blog closely connected to other industry players. We have navigated misinformation and coordinated pushback for over a decade - this is not new in our industry. We are used to dealing with intentional attempts to discredit our team, our community, and our disruptive vision. We also believe strongly in educating adults who may be considering a career in the adult industry. The internet's memory is permanent, and the promotional gimmick of instant explosive financial success is false and potentially dangerous. ManyVids is a creative pop-culture community for adults where positive freedom of speech and creative expression are welcomed, but where we also understand that sustainable success requires long-term effort and business skills. ManyVids' News feed offers daily entertainment with original informational content, well-researched historical references, art, and humor. For that level of human creativity combined with Al intelligence to thrive, it is crucial to offer a safe space, which is why we do not allow public comments on our free social posts-this helps maintain an uplifting and joyful environment. ManyVids is an inclusive, decentralized, human-driven ecosystem for adults first and always will be. Our offering of both 18+ NSFW and SFW content is our biggest strength and differentiation. The evolved intimacy products of the future will likely include humanoid robotics with interactive capabilities. Al companions with sexual capabilities will become increasingly in demand, and tech firms with strong, proven ethical expertise, supported by real-time creator uploads that reflect constantly evolving human sexual expression and interaction, will become extremely valuable in the near future. As we all know, we are about to experience unprecedented job-market disruption. To ensure a positive future for humanity, we need to act now and have solutions in place for this upcoming transformational tsunami. At ManyVids, we have created a Human-Centered Economy a job-creation model of the future where humans can monetize their passions, stay connected, and remain motivated. We believe Al companies should take this job-displacement challenge as seriously as their Al development, and we are open to collaborating with leading Al companies that want to help champion a worldwide transformation within the online adult industry in a way that makes it unrecognizable from what it is today, while also providing solutions for merit-based job creation for adults an ecosystem where redistribution through universal monthly or bi-weekly bonus-based income would be possible. We see Al not as taking jobs from humans, but as freeing people from work they never wanted to do in the first place, so they can pursue more meaningful, human-centered paths based on respect and creativity on platforms such as ManyVids. With bold and courageous visionaries, the future can be filled with abundance if we take the right actions today. At ManyVids, we hope to play an important role in building a world where human health, respect for all, and meaning are celebrated and protected in an increasingly Al- and robotics-driven world. -MV Team"
