'TARGET RICH' NEIGHBORHOODS

Palantir is working on a tool for ICE [https://www.404media.co/r/7c894f1c?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address, 404 Media has learned. ICE is using it to find locations where lots of people it might detain could be based. The findings, based on internal ICE material obtained by 404 Media, public procurement records, and recent sworn testimony from an ICE official, show the clearest link yet between the technological infrastructure Palantir is building for ICE and the agency’s activities on the ground. The tool receives peoples’ addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services among a range of other sources, according to the material.

THE NEW META

AI generated influencers are sharing fake images on Instagram [https://www.404media.co/r/0b6413b7?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] that appear to show them having sex with celebrities like LeBron James, iShowSpeed, and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. One AI influencer even shared an image of her in bed with Venezuela’s president Nicolás Maduro. The images are AI generated but are not disclosed as such, and funnel users to an adult content site where the AI generated influencers sell nude images. This recent trend is the latest strategy from the growing business of monetizing AI generated porn by harvesting attention on Instagram with shocking or salacious content.

NICE WORK GUYS

A handful of police departments that use Flock have unwittingly leaked details of millions of surveillance targets [https://www.404media.co/r/ebfb90a7?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] and a large number of active police investigations around the country because they have failed to redact license plates information in public records releases. Flock responded to this revelation by threatening a site that exposed it and by limiting the information the public can get via public records requests. Completely unredacted Flock audit logs have been released to the public by numerous police departments and in some cases include details on millions of Flock license plate searches made by thousands of police departments from around the country.

DASHCAMS FOR THE PEOPLE

When self-employed software engineer Nick Benson put out the call for dashcams online, he thought he’d get maybe 10 people to donate. More than 500 dashcams have shown up on his front porch [https://www.404media.co/r/c717eba8?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] in suburban Minneapolis. “The state apparatus, of course, has cameras everywhere,” Benson told 404 Media. “The citizens will also benefit from having the same cameras around to document what's going on and making sure that everything is on the up and up.” On January 7, two days after Benson put out his call for dashcams, ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot legal observer Renee Good in the face. In the wake of that killing, multiple people have filmed agents threatening the lives of other observers. Benson feels like he has to do something, so he gets dashcams into the hands of people who want them. “We need more documentation showing what these people are doing. Because I don't know—other than a compelling visual documentation of what's going on—I don't know what other tools we have until the legislative branch of our government can stand up and do its job and provide a check to all of this, because our state government can't,” he said.

This is Behind the Blog [https://www.404media.co/r/5eba8fd2?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], where we share our behind-the-scenes thoughts about how a few of our top stories of the week came together. This week, we discuss the staying power of surveillance coverage, the jigsaw of reporting, and eyestrain.

JASON: I’ve started this year in the same way I spent a lot of last year: Writing about the automated license plate reader company Flock. In my career it’s been sort of weird for me to focus on one company or one thing so much for so long. I tend to get a little restless about the topics I cover, and there can sometimes be a very real fatigue with specific types of stories. After a while, people “get it,” and so the bar for a new story on a topic keeps going up. I wish this weren’t the case, and we try to cover things we feel are important, but if you’re writing about a topic and no one is reading it, then the audience might be telling you they don’t find that thing interesting anymore. 

This has not yet been the case with Flock, somewhat to my surprise. I’ve been writing about surveillance technologies for a long time, and it’s rare for a specific company or specific type of technology to hold people’s interest and attention for too long.

With Flock, if anything, I have noticed that there is more awareness and more concern about what this company is doing. I am proud that our work has led to tangible changes at the company as well as actual impact on the ground, with city councils and people in towns across America reconsidering whether they want this technology to spread essentially unfettered in their communities. Earlier this week I was sent video of a three-hour city council meeting in Florence, Oregon [https://www.404media.co/r/2bffdd6c?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], in which the only topic was Flock. Person after person went up to the mic and talked eloquently about their concerns with the technology, and a lot of them cited reporting that I have worked on in some way. This is happening all over the country, we hear about it basically every day at this point. This reporting has been some of the work I’m proudest of in my career, because of that impact.

In my interview with YouTuber Benn Jordan [https://www.404media.co/r/169d0002?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], who has done extremely good work on Flock while also amplifying a lot of ours, he brought up the fact that he doesn’t like to make more than one video on any topic. He has now made three about Flock. At 404 Media, we have had the same experience with working on stories about Flock: Anytime we publish anything about the company, we get 10 more tips about other things we should look into. This is pretty unusual. We often get new tips about a topic whenever we write about anything, but the depth and breadth of tips we’ve gotten about Flock show that this is affecting people all over the country, and that mistakes big and small are being made by the company, the police, and local governments in how it’s being used. I think this speaks not just to the interest in Flock, but also the fact that it is now in so many different places, in so many different types of communities. 

For every Flock story you see on 404 Media, there are (at least) 10 that we haven’t had time to track down or dig into. We are trying to be discerning about what we spend our time on, and I don’t want to spend all of my time writing about this technology only, but it seems the interest is still there. And the types of stories end up feeling novel; it has been notable how many new and interesting ways this technology has been used in ways that feel story worthy. 

JOSEPH: I wanted to write a little bit about the difficulty in building up a picture of Palantir’s work with ICE. 

This latest round of Palantir coverage and finding out what the company was doing in the second Trump administration started in April when I reported on procurement records showing ICE paid Palantir tens of millions [https://www.404media.co/r/47138478?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] for “complete target analysis of known populations.” A day later, I published Leaked: Palantir’s Plan to Help ICE Deport People [https://www.404media.co/r/aec68500?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], which was based on leaked Slacks and a wiki from inside Palantir. 

Since then, many other journalists have published really interesting stuff about Palantir and its work with ICE and the wider government. A day after my Palantir leak story, WIRED had DOGE Is Building a Master Database to Surveil and Track Immigrants [https://www.404media.co/r/6ce687db?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410]. Later that month CNN largely matched and built upon that with DOGE is building a master database for immigration enforcement, sources say [https://www.404media.co/r/b3a9ef15?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410]. You’ve also had ProPublica do really deep reporting [https://www.404media.co/r/fc20f20e?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] on the system being built to share IRS data with ICE, even if that one doesn’t discuss Palantir.  

It feels like we’re all trying to put a jigsaw puzzle together, but I have one corner piece, CNN has another, another outlet has another, etc. But it’s not necessarily clear what the jigsaw actually is. Some reports say “master database,” others don’t. I have deferred to this term when referencing other’s coverage, but I haven’t heard that term myself. What I hear are the specific tool or system names. ATrac (also known as Alien Tracker), ImmigrationOS, ELITE, etc. ATrac came up in an article I wrote called ICE Plans Central Database of Health, Labor, Housing Agency Data to Find Targets [https://www.404media.co/r/b7bd2ed7?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410]. To be honest, it’s not always clear if we’re talking about the same thing or not, story to story. It really depends on the current article I’m writing and what comes out. Even my own stories don’t necessarily relate to one another. ICE seems to have a lot of tools.

That’s why I think our latest piece, ‘ELITE’: The Palantir App ICE Uses to Find Neighborhoods to Raid [https://www.404media.co/r/55fc0bda?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], is important. It finally draws a line between what Palantir is building and what ICE is doing on the ground. It’s no longer some abstract tech project happening somewhere over there. It’s a system being used to target specific neighborhoods.

I like that piece too because it is based on multiple, very different sources of information. There’s the leaked ELITE user guide. Public procurement records which show the Palantir connection. And the transcript from an ICE official.

I had to pay more than $650 to get those transcripts. I pinged the court to buy them and got an out of office response. The lawyers defending the woman ICE detained declined to share them, saying a redaction window was underway. I don’t think that matters though, I’ve bought countless transcripts during this time; it just means the transcript isn’t available on PACER, the U.S. court records system, yet. Fortunately, the court reporter got back to me and gave that ~$650 quote. Paying these people is always funny. I don’t know how their pay works exactly, but you have to pay them with Venmo or CashApp, or they send you a credit card payment portal that goes directly to them. You’re not paying the court really, you’re paying the person who typed up what was said in the room.

Anyway at VICE, one of the catalysts for me wanting to leave was that I couldn’t even pull up a 10 cents court record because VICE wasn’t paying its bills. Here, because we own the company and we have the support of our paying subscribers like you, I was able to make an immediate decision of ‘this is a lot of money, but it is worth it for this story, that transcript is really important to see what they’re using ELITE for’. So I just bought it. No agonizing emails back and forth with company bureaucracy. Just a note to Sam, Emanuel, and Jason saying hey, FYI I’m buying this, and did it. We probably will publish the transcripts themselves, I’m just working on something else related to them so not just yet. We have power inside our own company to do the shit that lets us get important stuff out.

SAM: I don’t know about you, but my eyeballs hurt. I mean psychologically, they are taking in a lot of horrors all the time, as state-sanctioned violence escalates to the point of flashbanging babies in car seats and shooting teenagers and moms in the face. But I also mean literally, physically, they’re strained from not blinking enough and sitting two feet from a screen all day. 

I have very bad eyesight — like, if I was dropped in an unfamiliar place without my thicc glasses I would be in real trouble — and I’ve been wearing contacts almost every day since I was 13. So these poor old globes get dry and tired. In my previously-mentioned quest to stop muddling through life with a Joyce Manor Constant Headache, I have tried all sorts of weird cures for this problem including blue light blocking glasses, screen filters and protectors, and whole-head ice packs. This week I tried a new one. I downloaded a timer that forces me to stop looking at the screen every 30 minutes for 30 seconds. 

As a side note: the catchy version of this is something called the 20-20-20 rule [https://www.404media.co/r/d0ab6276?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], which says every 20 minutes spent using a screen you should try to look away at something that is 20 feet away from you for a total of 20 seconds. But I’m doing it the way that works best for me because 20 minutes is not quite enough time to finish a full paragraph or thought sometimes.

The first timer I tried was LookAway [https://www.404media.co/r/0f440d25?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], which is free to try and costs $38 for a license if you like it, and is only on Mac. Every 30 minutes (or whatever time intervals you want to set it to) it blurs out the entire screen for 30 seconds (again, adjustable). I liked this a lot because it’s got a very soothing UI and makes a nice noise when the timer starts and stops. But I switch between my Macbook and my desktop PC throughout the day, and needed something that works on both, so now I’m using a Chrome extension called Eye Saver [https://www.404media.co/r/32aa1f82?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410]. It does the same job but is less cute. It’s free, but obviously use at your own risk re: browser extensions.  

I like these timers a lot for a couple reasons, some of them I didn’t expect.

Physically: During the break, ideally you’re looking at things in the distance, like out a window or across the room. I realized that this actually hurt at first. It felt like my eyes were tight muscles I was trying to stretch. Looking at one of our cats was fine; looking out the window across the street was uncomfortable. Not good! Within a couple days of taking breaks, the tight feeling lessened.

Mentally: The breaks have become essential. I actually ended up lengthening the breaks to a full minute after a few days, because they get me out of a scroll hole that’s primarily videos and images of The Horrors. Taking a minute to reset means I feel less overwhelmed, am losing track of time less, and have a tiny bit of space to let my brain attempt some idle processing. 

Existentially: The timer makes me feel something that’s uncomfortable to face, that I need something external to remove my constant stimulus so I don’t end up in pain or go insane and start climbing the cage walls. But as it’s been said many times: We weren’t meant to consume this much information all of the time. It’s bad. So I’ll take my little Pavlovian timer if that’s what it takes. If you have your own coping mechanisms for looking at the bad screens for too long, I'd love to hear them in the comments.
