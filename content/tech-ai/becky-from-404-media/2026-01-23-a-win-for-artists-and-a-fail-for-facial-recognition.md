EUREKA!

Scientists have discovered that men with larger penises are not only more attractive to women, they are also deemed more threatening to men, which is “the first experimental evidence that males assess rivals’ [https://www.404media.co/r/0a7bcc91?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] fighting ability and attractiveness to females based partly on a rival’s penis size,” according to a study published in PLOS Biology on Thursday. “In humans, height and body shape are well known to influence attractiveness, but penis size has rarely been tested alongside these traits in a controlled, experimental setup,” said Upama Aich, a behavioral and evolutionary biologist at the University of Western Australia who led the study, in an email to 404 Media.

EARTH TO MANYVIDS

In posts on ManyVids, the porn platform’s official account holds imaginary conversations with aliens, alongside AI-generated videos of UFOs, fractal images, “angel numbers,” and a video of its founder Bella French in a space suit shooting lasers from her eyes. Adult content creators use ManyVids to sell custom videos and subscriptions, and perform live on camera. French recently changed her personal website to state her new goal is to “transition one million people out of the adult industry and do everything we can to ensure no one new enters it.” This sudden shift away from years of messaging [https://www.404media.co/r/2248a997?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] about being a compatriot with sex workers, combined with bizarre AI-generated text and images about talking to aliens and numerology on social media, has made some creators worry for their livelihoods, and caused others to leave the site completely.

YOU HAD ONE JOB

When authorities used Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) facial recognition app on a detained woman in an attempt to learn her identity and immigration status, it returned two different and incorrect names [https://www.404media.co/r/59c1331b?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], raising serious questions about the accuracy of the app ICE is using to determine who should be removed from the United States, according to testimony from a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official obtained by 404 Media. ICE has told lawmakers the app, called Mobile Fortify, provides a “definitive” determination of someone’s immigration status, and should be trusted over a birth certificate. The incident, which happened last year in Oregon, casts doubt on that claim.

"WE'RE NOT GOING TO SIT BY THE SIDELINES"

San Diego Comic-Con changed an AI art friendly policy following an artist-led backlash last week [https://www.404media.co/r/f49c63ad?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410]. It was a small victory for working artists in an industry where jobs are slipping away as movie and video game studios adopt generative AI tools to save time and money. Every year, tens of thousands of people descend on San Diego for Comic-Con, the world’s premier comic book convention that over the years has also become a major pan-media event where every major media company announces new movies, TV shows, and video games. For the past few years, Comic-Con has allowed some forms of AI-generated art at this art show at the convention. According to archived rules for the show, artists could display AI-generated material so long as it wasn’t for sale, was marked as AI-produced, and credited the original artist whose style was used.

COMMENTS OF THE WEEK

Replying to ICE’s Facial Recognition App Misidentified a Woman. Twice [https://www.404media.co/r/3ffcdd82?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], Brian D Jordan writes:

And in response to Comic-Con Bans AI Art After Artist Pushback [https://www.404media.co/r/e5550744?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], Conrad writes: 

> “This feels like a huge W for artists! Wonderful to read some happy news today. IMO only sentient creatures can make art, and so I prefer to say AI-generated imagery or AI-generated music but it's a mouthful. A person prompting a tool to generate images on their behalf and ‘curating it’ isn't art to me. AI image generators are digital colonizers. Sure, the stuff in the British Museum may look cool but when you think about how it arrived there, it's pretty damn devastating, but even those pieces of art were painstakingly crafted by people. I find myself looking at less art online these days from artists I don't know because it's exhausting trying to figure out pieces' provenance and have been enjoying more time seeking out traditional art in museums.” 

This is Behind the Blog [https://www.404media.co/r/e99d24cf?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], where we share our behind-the-scenes thoughts about how a few of our top stories of the week came together. This week, we discuss stances on AI, a conference about money laundering, and signs about slavery coming down.

EMANUEL: Last week we published my interview with the Wikimedia Foundation CTO Selena Deckelmann [https://www.404media.co/r/c0077feb?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410]. I was happy to talk to her because she’s uniquely positioned to talk about generative AI’s impact on the internet both as the CTO of the website that creates some of the most valuable training data, and one of the sites that’s threatened by generative AI output the most. 

I thought it was a good conversation that gives us a good look at how Wikimedia is thinking about the issue, but judging by the comments on the article not everyone was happy with it. I had the thought that some people would react this way in the back of my mind during the interview, so I’m not entirely surprised. The issue, according to those who expressed it in the comments, is that I didn’t push back hard enough on Deckelmann when she discussed her position on AI, and specifically, that she herself used AI to code some things and doesn’t forbid others who report to her from doing the same. 

I’ve written a few [https://www.404media.co/r/e7c916da?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] stories [https://www.404media.co/r/6c99a1cc?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] about [https://www.404media.co/r/122abfb9?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] the dangers of vibe coding, which like all generative AI tools, is prone to errors. In retrospect, I think I should have spent a minute or two noting those dangers and asking Deckelmann how she thinks about them. My sense of it, given how she talked about AI generations compromising the reliability of Wikipedia's articles and her admiration of the editors combating that problem, is that she’s well aware of the risk, but it would have been better to get her on the record. I think that’s a fair note on the interview. 

More broadly, however, a problem that I think we’re going to run into over and over again at 404 Media is that people don’t think our position exactly matches their own, which is going to happen when we are transparent about how we approach stories. My position is that generative AI is, at the moment, an inherently flawed technology, that it’s wildly misrepresented by the companies that create it, and that it’s creating a lot of unnecessary chaos in the world. I could spend more time explaining how I arrived at this position but it’s easier for me to point to my author page, where you’ll find three years of stories, most of which outline all of these problems in great detail.

At the same time, I can recognize that “AI” is an incredibly broad term that covers everything from the software I use to create interview transcription (that I then have to correct, because they always get something wrong), to nonconsensual AI-generated sexual abuse images. I’m not a prophet, but as terrible as the rollout of AI has been, my reporting also leads me to believe that even after many of these overvalued AI companies are crushed by reality, generative AI as a technology will stick around in some form. My hope is that our reporting makes it better than it would be without it. 

I think because we have been so critical of AI and have exposed many abuses it and the companies that profit from it have enabled, we’ve gained many readers who have an even more critical view of AI, and we hope they continue reading and supporting us and voice their opinions in the comments. Some people think AI is entirely irredeemable. I would not rule out the possibility that it can be useful, and would encourage people to continue being critical of it while recognizing how it’s already been integrated into our lives in non-harmful ways. I think our reporting can be valuable to you even if you disagree with that position. 

JOSEPH: So right now I'm at an anti-money laundering conference I was invited to speak at, about a small part of my book DARK WIRE. That discussed a specific guy who exchanged money for drug traffickers, either moving cash around the globe from safehouse to safehouse or converting bitcoin to cash and vice versa. That was a really interesting part of my research into that book because it showed how drug traffickers are able to use a shadow banking system and bypass KYC, or know your customer, checks on things like crypto exchanges. They just work with essentially a criminal bitcoin trader instead.

The conference is run by the Central Bank of the Bahamas. There's a couple of journalists here–myself and one from ICIJ, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the people who do the Panama papers, the FinCEN files, all of that sort of thing. But mostly it is academics. I haven't been sort of around academics or to an academic conference in a long time and although our disciplines are incredibly different, it is pretty refreshing to be around them. The work is obviously a completely different approach when they look at money laundering and drug traffickers or whatever they look at. It is of course much more systematic and slower pace, and I wouldn't say it's more rigorous but it is rigorous in different ways. 

There’s been some really interesting stuff presented about the mega rich’s super yachts, how they move, where they move, when they move. So maybe when I'm back I'll write an article on that, about how this research show was able to combine a bunch of different data sets to plot that out. There was also an Italian researcher who in their position, I believe, inside the Italian government, essentially they had access to very sensitive data such as the credit rating of businesses and other quite confidential information that they say had the names of the businesses stripped. They were able to plot whether when the mafia took over or assisted a particular business, because they were desperate for whatever reason the Mafia was able to extract value while the performance of the company continued to plummet. There are a couple other things which I will look into while here but a very interesting conference and a good chance to meet people who are in the same sort of space and look at kind of the same sort of issues but in a very different way.

SAM: I want to highlight something that happened in the last 24 hours that I think will get too easily buried in everything else happening this week. Yesterday, a couple of guys from, reportedly, the National Park Service, went to the President’s House in Philadelphia, where George Washington and John Adams lived, and ripped down signs about the history of slavery and specifically the slaves who lived there.

This is a result of Trump’s March 2025 executive order, [https://www.404media.co/r/79650d96?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] “Restoring Truth and Sanity To American History,” that demanded public officials ensure that public monuments and markers under the Department of the Interior’s jurisdiction never address anything negative about American history, past or present. I will admit, when I read that EO, my first thought was: they’ll never actually put in the time and manpower to get these signs taken down. It’s a big country with a lot of national parks, a lot of placards. I guess I also kind of hoped no one working in the park system would take it seriously or comply; Trump has gutted parks using budget cuts [https://www.404media.co/r/a6b18f60?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], to a dangerous level, and seeing your colleagues worked to the bone just to be laid off is usually a radicalizing experience. Maybe there is resistance to these signs coming down internally, but some already have been removed before the President’s House signs yesterday, and of course we don’t know for sure who the guys who took those down work for.

 

[https://www.404media.co/r/b3b9625a?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410]

Philly’s National Inquirer talked to one of them [https://www.404media.co/r/d2cf06df?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] while he was taking the signs down—an Independence Park employee who would not give his name—and reported that “his supervisor had instructed him to take down all the displays at the iconic site earlier that day. Three other individuals later joined the employee to help remove the educational exhibits. The final display was removed at 4:30 p.m. The displays were then loaded into the back of a white Park Service pickup truck.” 

“I’m just following my orders,” the employee told the Inquirer. 

Archivists know better than to wait and see what happens, or assume anything but the worst-case scenario is plausible. The Save Our Signs project [https://www.404media.co/r/f5e24dd3?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410], which I’ve written about a couple times, started archiving signs immediately. In November, [https://www.404media.co/r/c03fe37a?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410] I got to talk to two leaders from the project, so give that a listen if you haven’t. We’ll probably see a lot more of this, since these signs are being removed in the middle of the day in major cities now.
