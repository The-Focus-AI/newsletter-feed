### 🤝 From our partners: Vault-Free Privileged Access for Modern Engineering Teams

As AI and cloud infrastructure scale, managing privileged access with static credentials and vaults becomes both a bottleneck and a risk. Teleport replaces rotated credentials and vaulted secrets with real Zero Trust, issuing short-lived, cryptographic certificates at runtime for every human, machine, and AI agent.

**Last week at CES:** Robots! More Robots! And Jensen Huang says they will have human-level capabilities THIS year. We went to see if robots were aware of that. [Watch the video :)](https://youtu.be/PAjb83HHLaU)

Also last week: **Why OpenAI and Anthropic Chose Healthcare at the Same Time**

Right after the holidays, both [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-for-healthcare/) and [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/healthcare-life-sciences) announced healthcare-focused initiatives within days of each other. For the first time, I don’t think about it as a competition, what I like about it is that it’s a signal that **healthcare has crossed a threshold where staying out is no longer the cautious choice.** 

For several years, healthcare was treated as a deferred domain for leading AI labs. Understandably: the sector is heavily regulated, operationally fragmented, and unforgiving to confident mistakes. Earlier generations of models were difficult to bound, difficult to audit, and prone to failure modes that could not be cleanly isolated from their successes. In low-stakes domains, this was ok. In healthcare – not at all.

The decision by both labs to move now implies a shared conclusion that something fundamental has changed. The **models are **for sure more capable now, but most importantly – they are **more governable. **

**Healthcare is **therefore better understood as **a systems test **rather than a market opportunity. **This is a hugely important step in AI adoption.**

Another moment worth mentioning: doctors should not be worried. **What AI is being applied to is coordination. **It’s an old problem in healthcare that no one is structurally positioned to assemble full context under time pressure: information is distributed across multiple systems, and signals from medications, labs, imaging, wearables, genetics, and prior history are rarely considered together when decisions are made – and patients are left to play detectives putting all the pieces together on their own. In this framing, **LLMs** are not making medical judgments. They **mainly help bring existing information together so it can be reviewed more easily**. 

Both labs appear to believe this coordination role is now stable enough to **turn into a product.**

**Where the two labs differ is in how they approach this coordination role.** 

**OpenAI is extending its general assistant** into healthcare, treating health data as another high-value context that can sit alongside documents, calendars, and enterprise tools, with additional privacy and access controls layered on top. The underlying assumption is that a single, familiar interface can serve patients, clinicians, and administrative workflows, as long as the boundaries around data use are clearly defined.

**Anthropic is taking a narrower approach.** Its healthcare effort is oriented less toward a patient-facing assistant and more toward embedding Claude inside existing institutional workflows. The emphasis is on predictable behavior, limited scope, and alignment with how healthcare organizations already operate. Rather than broad continuity across use cases, the focus is on fitting cleanly into specific professional contexts.

The choices what to focus on reflect different theories of how trust is built in regulated systems. One assumes trust emerges from continuity and widespread use, the other from constraint and institutional alignment. It is not yet clear which approach will prove more durable, and it is possible that both will coexist in different parts of the system. What matters is that both labs are now willing to test their models in an environment where responsibility cannot remain abstract. I’m very excited about this new development.

### News from the usual suspects

* **Gmail Gets Gemini-fied**
Gmail is [stepping into](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/gmail/gmail-is-entering-the-gemini-era/) 2026 with Gemini AI at the helm. Google’s flagship inbox now offers AI Overviews to summarize email threads, answer natural language queries, and filter clutter with the upcoming “AI Inbox.” Help Me Write and Suggested Replies get smarter, while proofreading goes premium. It’s no longer just email – it’s your AI-powered executive assistant.

* **Apple + Google: The Gemini Marriage**
Apple has [picked](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/12/apple-google-ai-siri-gemini.html?) Google’s Gemini to power the long-delayed AI upgrade to Siri, marking a rare alliance between rivals. The multiyear partnership puts Gemini models at the core of Apple’s upcoming “Foundation Models,” keeping compute mostly on-device and in Apple’s private cloud. Apple remains mum on the $1B/year price tag, but this move signals Cupertino is finally showing up to the AI arms race – fashionably late, of course.

* **Musk's Macrohard Moment**
xAI, Elon Musk’s AI venture, [torched $7.8 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-09/musk-s-xai-reports-higher-quarterly-loss-plans-to-power-optimus) in just nine months, chasing its dream of powering humanoid robots like Optimus. Despite swelling quarterly losses, revenue doubled to $107 million, and a $20B cash injection (featuring Nvidia) suggests the spending spree is far from over. "Macrohard" may be a pun on Microsoft – but the burn rate is no joke.

Caption: 

Researchers from MIT CSAIL present Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a novel inference-time architecture enabling LLMs to process arbitrarily long prompts – scaling beyond 10 million tokens, over 100× typical context windows. Instead of consuming the prompt directly, RLMs offload it into a Python REPL as a variable (`context`), allowing the LLM to symbolically interact with the prompt via code. The model can read, transform, and decompose the context and recursively call sub-LLMs through a built-in `llm_query()` function. This enables dynamic task decomposition, selective context access, and unbounded reasoning. RLMs require no retraining and work with existing models (GPT-5, Qwen3-Coder), achieving up to 2× higher accuracy than base LLMs and long-context agents on benchmarks like BrowseComp+, OOLONG, and OOLONG-Pairs, while keeping inference cost comparable or lower. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of both the REPL environment and recursive sub-calls in solving complex, information-dense tasks.
**This is a significant step forward because RLMs break the fundamental context window barrier of LLMs – enabling scalable, symbolic, and recursive reasoning over massive inputs without retraining or architectural changes** →[read the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601)
