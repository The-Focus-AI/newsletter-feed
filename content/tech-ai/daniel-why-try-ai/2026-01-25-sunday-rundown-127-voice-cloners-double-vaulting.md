💰 Sunday Bonus #87: Extract insights from messy notes with "Note Decoder"
If you’re anything like me, you often take notes during meetings or brainstorming sessions that end up just…sitting there.
I jot stuff down with the best intentions but rarely get around to organizing them.
That’s where Note Decoder comes in!
This Claude artifact turns scribbles and half-baked notes into structured insights. Simply snap a photo and feed it to Note Decoder.
It can handle pretty much any input: handwritten notes on a paper napkin, whiteboard filled with post-its, doodles with cryptic labels, whatever.
Here’s what happens:
Clean transcription: You get a copy-ready text version of your notes.
Guided cleanup: The tool walks you through its interpretation and asks for clarifications (“WTF does ‘PX689 at 7 o’clock blue’ even mean, bro?”).
Structured output: You get a nicely formatted page with key decisions, action items, and other outputs relevant to your notes and answers.
Note Decoder makes sure your notes become something actionable instead of gathering dust in a corner somewhere.
All you need is a free Claude account :...
