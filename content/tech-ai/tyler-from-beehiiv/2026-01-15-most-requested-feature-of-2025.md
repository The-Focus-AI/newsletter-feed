With Dynamic Content, you can tailor a single newsletter for every reader.

It’s the same approach used by the pros at brands like Morning Brew, TheSkimm, and Axios to deliver personalized newsletters at scale.

This was our most requested feature of 2025. After rolling out early access to Enterprise customers, Dynamic Content is now available more widely 🤝

And that’s not all. Today’s release also includes:

🤖 Automations v3
🌐 Website Builder v2
➕ Bulk Actions

Let’s dive in 👇

Imagine if every email you sent felt like it was written just for the person reading it.
That’s the power of Dynamic Content, one of our most requested features ever.

Dynamic Content lets you personalize your emails by showing different content to different readers, all within a single send. There’s no code, no custom templating, and no extra complexity.

**Here’s an example: **Say** **I want to promote a new playbook I’m selling, but only to readers who _haven’t_ already bought it.

With Dynamic Content, I can set this up in three simple steps:

1. Add the digital product to my newsletter

2. Open **Visibility Settings** and set a new dynamic content condition (e.g., _whether a reader has already__ purchased this playbook_)

3. Toggle visibility **off** for readers who meet that condition

When I send my newsletter, past buyers won’t see the promotion, but everyone else will. 

But why stop there? You can also…

* Show different sponsors to different reader cohorts

* Promote events only to readers in specific regions

* Nudge readers who haven’t completed your onboarding survey

**Dynamic Content **is now available to all users on our [Max plan](https://app.beehiiv.com/settings/workspace/billing_and_plan).  

Upgrade to Max (https://app.beehiiv.com/settings/workspace/billing_and_plan)

“**Note: **Dynamic Content is only available to users on our Max or Enterprise plans. You can learn more and/or upgrade [here](https://app.beehiiv.com/settings/workspace/billing_and_plan).“ —

## Automations v3

--------------------
Last month, we released **Automations v3 **— our most powerful automation suite yet.

But it’s not just more capable. It’s also easier to use, with a faster, more intuitive design. 

Today, we’re building on that foundation with a few new additions:

**Product Purchase Trigger **

You can now start an automation the moment a reader buys one of your digital products. This connects your products to the entire beehiiv ecosystem, unlocking new ways to serve your customers.

**Automations Home Base**

We also launched a new home base for all of your automations. The redesigned table adds more data, plus improved search, filtering, and sorting.

## Website Builder

--------------------
Each week, we ship dozens of new features and enhancements to the Website Builder. Here are two of my recent favorites…

**Image Carousel **

You can now add multiple images within a single image element to create a carousel. It’s fully customizable, so you can edit the layout, pagination type, sizing, arrow design, and more.

**Insert Elements from Layers**

Instead of dropping new elements onto a webpage and hoping they land in the right place, you can now insert elements directly from the Layers tab, giving you more precision and control over your website design.

Launch Your Dream Website (https://app.beehiiv.com/website_builder_v2)

“**Note: **These features are only available on our v2 Website Builder. If you’re still on our Legacy Builder, we’ve built a 1-click migration that will seamlessly move your site to v2 [here](https://app.beehiiv.com/website_builder).“ —

## Bulk Post Actions

--------------------
By popular demand, you can now take bulk actions across multiple posts at once.

Simply select the posts you want to update, then:

* Add or remove tags

* Add or remove authors

* Hide posts from the feed or show them again

* Archive, unarchive, or delete the posts

Welcome to content management, simplified.
