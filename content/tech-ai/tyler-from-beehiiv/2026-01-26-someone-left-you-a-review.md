⭐️  Native product reviews
💶  International currency support
🍎  Apple Pay + Google Pay
📉  Discount codes
💰️  Full and partial refunds
📂  Improved notifications

Let’s dive in 👇

For the first time, your newsletter, website, and storefront all live in one place.
No third-party tools. No redirects. Just you, your audience, and what you create.

Digital Products are as diverse and flexible as the publishers creating them. Today, you can sell:

* **Files: **Guides, templates, eBooks, or research reports

* **Links: **Exclusive website access, memberships, or affiliate offers

* **Time: **Paid coaching, consulting, or 1:1 sessions

As always, beehiiv takes **0% of your revenue**. What you charge is what you earn.

Launching your first product takes minutes. And when you do, it lives on a fully customizable product page optimized for both performance (driving sales) and design (impressing your friends).

--------------------
## Product Reviews ⭐️ 

--------------------
Reviews build trust, and trust drives sales.

You can now automatically collect product reviews and display them directly on your product page. It’s social proof that helps turn more visitors into buyers. 

Getting started is simple. Just navigate to your [product settings](https://app.beehiiv.com/monetize/products/settings) and choose when you’d like customers to submit a review:

* Immediately 

* 24 hours after purchase

* 48 hours after purchase 

We’ll take it from there. Your customers will receive an automated review request, and you’ll see the responses start to populate in your [Reviews Dashboard](https://app.beehiiv.com/monetize/products/reviews).

Through the entire process, you’re always in control. Approve the reviews you want, and reject the ones you don’t. Only approved reviews appear on your product page.

## Global Payments 

--------------------
Your readers are everywhere. Your payments should be, too.

We now support payments in 10 major currencies, so more customers can buy without friction. And with Apple Pay and Google Pay now available, checkout is smoother than ever.

--------------------
## Discount Codes and Refunds

--------------------
With **Discount Codes**, it’s easier than ever to run promotions, test offers, and scale revenue with confidence.

Your codes are fully customizable. You control:

* Which products qualify

* How much customers save

* When the promotion ends

* How often a code can be used

In addition, you can now issue full or partial refunds directly from beehiiv, so your entire customer lifecycle — from first purchase to ongoing support — lives in one place.

## The beehiiv Advantage

--------------------
Beyond being one of the few platforms that doesn’t take a single penny of your product revenue, there are plenty more reasons why launching on beehiiv just makes more cents (sorry).

With a simple backslash in our post editor, you can seamlessly embed your digital product into your newsletter and let readers purchase without leaving your email.

Plus, you don’t need to settle for your product looking exactly like everyone else’s. While other platforms force you into rigid layouts, beehiiv’s powerful Website Builder lets you fully customize your product page to match your brand.

Your digital product also integrates seamlessly into our entire automation suite. With the recently introduced **Product Purchase Trigger**, you can kick off an automated journey the moment a reader becomes a customer.

And when it comes time to manage your revenue, there’s no need to juggle multiple tools.

The beehiiv Wallet powers Digital Products, giving you full insight into revenue, performance, and growth over time. That data lives alongside the other monetization features in our ecosystem — the Ad Network, Paid Subscriptions, and Boosts. A complete 360° view of your business is just a click away.
