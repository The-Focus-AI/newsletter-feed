Today let’s talk about the government’s effort to deflect outrage over the killing of American citizens by spreading disinformation about their deaths on X and other channels. The facts of the cases are outrageous, and suggest that many of the worst-case scenarios of a second Trump presidency are now increasingly likely. 

And at the same time, the enormous outcry over the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti underlines just how ineffective the Trump Administration’s disinformation campaign has been this time around. Trump officials have repeatedly lied and shared manipulated images in an effort to defend and promote their disastrous campaign in Minneapolis. But the story they are selling has increasingly few buyers. 

I’ve hesitated to write about Minneapolis until now out of the assumption that you can already guess what I think about it. Many journalists are doing brave and essential work documenting ICE’s terror campaign, its chilling use of sophisticated surveillance technology, and the lies that administration officials regularly tell about it on X and elsewhere.

But Pretti’s death, along with Renee Good’s before it, demands our full attention. For so long in this column I’ve covered the possibility that technological advances, platform failures, and the collapse of traditional journalism would result in a world where truth and fiction become ever harder to separate. We have seen that blurring be exploited by authoritarians in China, Russia, the Philippines, and India, among other countries.

And we saw it here in the United States during the first Trump Administration. But one advantage we had then that we have since lost is that tech platforms were then committed to serving as imperfect bulwarks against threats to our democracy. Chastened by the revelations that Russia had sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election by running large-scale influence campaigns on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter, the major social platforms invested in increased content moderation, fact-checking, labeling, and other tools intended to bolster the integrity of their systems. 

Now Twitter is X, those systems are gravely diminished, and a platform that once strived for rough political neutrality is now weighted to favor conservative voices [https://www.platformer.news/r/c991d27a?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]. When Trump shared misinformation about mail-in voting during his first term, Twitter placed a label on his tweet linking to accurate voting information. It also suspended the accounts of people who repeatedly spread hoaxes.

When Elon Musk bought the platform, he welcomed most of those people back onto the platform. And that created the perfect conditions for what immediately followed after federal agents shot to death a man who had been disarmed moments earlier.

Here are Tiffany Hsu, Stuart A. Thompson and Steven Lee Myers in the New York Times [https://www.platformer.news/r/5694fd1b?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]:

> While verified videos [https://www.platformer.news/r/7cb6e965?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] and witnesses showed how federal immigration agents tackled and shot Alex Pretti, 37, the posts tried to warp the events, including in ways intended to support the Trump Administration’s claims [https://www.platformer.news/r/d0eac8fe?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] that Mr. Pretti was at fault for his own death. Some posts smeared him or portrayed him as a radical activist.
> 
> Nick Sortor, a pro-Trump influencer with 1.4 million followers on X, incorrectly identified Mr. Pretti, a U.S. citizen, as an unauthorized immigrant. Jack Posobiec, a Trump loyalist with 3.3 million followers on X, falsely described Mr. Pretti as having “run up on police” and drawn a gun — claims that other users on X corrected in an appended note. Photos of different men — dressed in drag or shirtless at a street festival — were wrongly identified as Mr. Pretti and shared widely.

In ordinary times, lies like this might be removed or corrected by the platform. (Instead, it is left to X users to write corrections and hope they are surfaced by its Community Notes feature.)

Instead, though, posts like these have been reshared by Trump Administration officials, who often add their own inaccurate and inflammatory rhetoric. As Peter Baker put it elsewhere in the Times [https://www.platformer.news/r/5f53a3c3?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]:

> Twice since the start of the year, federal officers have gunned down protesters in Minneapolis with cellphone cameras rolling, and twice President Trump and his lieutenants have rushed forward with a message to the American people: Don’t believe what you see with your own eyes.
> 
> Without waiting for facts, the Trump team has advanced one-sided narratives to justify each of the killings and demonize the victims. Renee Good [https://www.platformer.news/r/0f711120?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670], a mother of three, was engaged in “domestic terrorism” and “viciously ran over the ICE Officer,” they declared. Alex Pretti [https://www.platformer.news/r/f54983bb?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670], an I.C.U. nurse at a veterans’ hospital, was an “assassin” aiming to “massacre law enforcement.”

As Baker notes, Trump does this because it works. If he can get a majority of Republicans [https://www.platformer.news/r/16385edd?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] to say that they believe the 2020 election was stolen, what else might he get them to believe?

The question is particularly pressing because the tech tools that are now widely available make it trivial to manufacture evidence to support almost any claim. I began the year by using Google’s SynthID tool to uncover a viral hoax on Reddit [https://www.platformer.news/r/5f412326?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]; the Times found that some social media accounts are using Gemini to “enhance” images related to Pretti’s death. In reality this introduced errors into them, such as by removing a gun from an agent’s hand.

We saw a similar case after Good’s shooting, when anti-ICE online detectives asked Grok to “unmask” [https://www.platformer.news/r/cb66d3de?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] and attempt to identify the federal agent who shot and killed her. It failed, but not before multiple people were falsely accused of the shooting.  

The White House itself has leaned into AI-altered images. Last week the activist Nekima Levy Armstrong was arrested at an anti-ICE protest that disrupted a church service. The White House’s official X account posted an image of Armstrong [https://www.platformer.news/r/76d82ca2?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] manipulated to make it look like she was bawling. It was reshared by Vice President JD Vance [https://www.platformer.news/r/59af00c0?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670].

Asked about why it was sharing fake images of a tragedy, a White House spokesman responded in part [https://www.platformer.news/r/b6430499?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]: “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.”

In that awful message, the administration signaled that the same just-joking logic it uses to justify some of its most offensive messages would also be used in its propaganda campaign in Minneapolis. The killing of American citizens bearing witness to ICE’s rampage and the arrests of anyone who protests their deaths would be reduced to meme fodder.

The only consolation here — and it is surely a minor one — is that Trump’s disinformation campaign does not appear to be working this time. Pretti’s shooting was documented by several verified videos taken from multiple angles and spread all across social media. In its wake, the Republican candidate for governor of Minnesota dropped out of the race [https://www.platformer.news/r/23113914?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670], calling ICE’s actions unconstitutional. The National Rifle Association and other gun activists called for a “full investigation” [https://www.platformer.news/r/5db21337?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] into the killing of Pretti, who was legally carrying a firearm at the protest. (A federal agent took his gun away shortly before agents shot him as many as 10 times.)

Trump himself appeared to seek to de-escalate the situation [https://www.platformer.news/r/bb673bf8?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] in Minneapolis on Monday, speaking positively about a phone call with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and (according to Walz) agreeing to an independent investigation of both killings.

Here, at last, was a case where Trump’s lies found few buyers. Pretti’s death, which anyone could see from multiple angles on social platforms, shocked the conscience of Democrats and Republicans alike. Even in a world where video can be fabricated, Pretti’s death had enough witnesses and enough documentary evidence that few were willing to disbelieve their eyes. 

The question now is how long that state of affairs will hold. We only know what happened in the Good and Pretti cases because they happened in the open, in the full view of other protesters and journalists who were filming. In future cases the evidence may be more limited, or ambiguous. And among the many grim lessons of the past few weeks it is that the worse it looks for Trump, the more likely it is that we will be lied to.

Following

The TikTok deal is done (and everyone is suspicious)

What happened: On Thursday, ByteDance struck a deal [https://www.platformer.news/r/32e4aa49?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] with a group of investors to officially create a new US TikTok spinoff aimed at loosening the app’s ties with China. Investors including Oracle, Abu Dhabi’s state investment firm MGX, and Silver Lake will own more than 80 percent of the new venture. Billionaire Michael Dell is also part of the investor group. ByteDance owns the remaining 20 percent and is the largest individual shareholder.

Adam Presser, a trust and safety exec and longtime lieutenant [https://www.platformer.news/r/4e9028f4?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] of CEO Shou Chew with deep ties to Hollywood, will lead the new US business, dubbed TikTok US Data Security Joint Venture LLC.

And while Chew’s memo to staff [https://www.platformer.news/r/06759e57?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] emphasized data protection for US users, the new TikTok might actually collect more detailed information on its users than before, a Wired review [https://www.platformer.news/r/925479f1?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] of its updated privacy policy showed. The app now tracks users’ precise locations, AI interactions, and may use collected data for targeted ads outside of the app. 

But any celebrations at TikTok US were short-lived. The app had a host of technical problems over the weekend [https://www.platformer.news/r/ff658bd8?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670], leading to conspiracy theories that the new owners were suppressing anti-ICE content. TikTok blamed an outage at a data center.

Why we’re following: The deal marks the end of a years-long saga that often seemed as though it would continue dragging on, unconstitutionally, forever. 

It will also have ripple effects for Chinese startups. More companies are “China shedding,” downplaying [https://www.platformer.news/r/a0966059?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] their Chinese roots as they grow and following in TikTok’s footsteps by moving their headquarters to Singapore. No one wants to be the next TikTok — or Manus [https://www.platformer.news/r/7de0e8e4?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670].

What people are saying: Jim Secreto, a strategic advisor and former Commerce and Treasury official, questioned [https://www.platformer.news/r/0792dab6?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] whether the deal was really worth it.

“Trump’s deal solved a narrow political problem: keeping a popular app online without backlash," he wrote. "ByteDance was constrained not by technical capacity but political risk. That constraint is now gone. Whether securing TikTok’s future in the US has made the country safer, or simply cleared the runway for a formidable global competitor, remains an open question."

Singer Billie Eilish said “tiktok is silencing people btw” on her Instagram account, screenshotting her brother Finneas O’Connell’s TikTok video about Alex Pretti’s death that logged fewer viewers than usual.

Claims of shadowbanning are notoriously hard to prove. (Even in the best of times, every individual person believes that every individual post of their is getting less attention than it should be.) TikTok’s problem seemed to extend beyond political content — reports surged on Downdetector over the weekend as thousands reported an inability to post videos and videos that displayed a view count of zero.

“It would be disturbing if the fear of foreign content manipulation was replaced by concerns over domestic censorship,” Glenn Gerstell, former National Security Agency general counsel told the Washington Post.

TikTok blamed [https://www.platformer.news/r/98008ecf?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] the disruption on “a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate.”

Dario Amodei’s Oppenheimer moment

What happened: Last year, Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei received wide attention for his essay “Machines of Loving Grace [https://www.platformer.news/r/4817553e?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670],” which was about how “powerful AI” might be really awesome. Today Amodei released [https://www.platformer.news/r/8d86de9c?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] a 38-page follow-up called “The Adolescence of Technology [https://www.platformer.news/r/77dbdc29?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670].” It’s about how “powerful AI” might be really, really bad.

What could go wrong if we get powerful AI within the next two years, as Amodei believes we might? He worries that given AIs can be “unpredictable and difficult to control,” and that smarter-than-human AIs might work against us in scary ways. (One section is cheekily titled “I’m sorry Dave,” after the famous pod-bay door scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey.) 

For another thing, making superintelligent AI widely available could give disturbed individuals access to weapons of mass destruction, Amodei writes. With powerful AI in their hands, a government or AI company might take over the world. (In that section Amodei says, “It is somewhat awkward to say this as the CEO of an AI company, but…”). He thinks AI could cause profound economic disruption, including “50% of entry level white collar jobs being disrupted is 1–5 years.”

But our AI Oppenheimer believes there is still hope. “In my time as a researcher, leader, and citizen, I have seen enough courage and nobility to believe that we can win,” Amodei writes.

He adds: “We have no time to lose.”

Why we’re following: Even in a landscape where multiple AI company CEOs have talked about how their product could kill us all, this essay is an interesting artifact: part manifesto, part exhortation to other AI companies, part government lobbying.

In a way, “The Adolescence of Technology” reads like a monologue in the third act of a movie, where a supervillain explains how all of the stuff they’ve been doing so far is part of their grand plan. In this case, it’s Amodei’s grand plan to prevent AI from literally ruining everything. While being the CEO of one of the biggest AI companies.

Amodei stresses the importance of AI companies taking voluntary action to address the risks they create. But he says that “the worst ones can still be a danger to everyone even if the best ones have excellent practices,” name-checking xAI’s CSAM scandal.

To address that gap, Amodei floats a ton of AI policy proposals, many of which Anthropic has lobbied for previously; the most interesting new-ish stuff is a suggestion of international cooperation for preventing AI-enabled bioweapons, and a tease that Anthropic might hedge against AI automation by offering its staffers lifetime employment.

Some Anthropic-backed proposals, including California AI transparency bill SB 53, have already passed. Amodei thinks transparency legislation will help society reckon with the challenge it’s about to face.

But it’s not clear how many of Anthropic's policy ideas will get traction under the current administration, especially given that Amodei has been vocally critical of Trump. 

He has something to say about that, too: AI companies should be developing a “healthier relationship with government — one based on substantive policy engagement rather than political alignment.”

What people are saying: In Lawfare, AI policy researcher Kevin Frazier writes [https://www.platformer.news/r/2b1db824?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] that he appreciates the effort Amodei took to discuss AI policy in a nuanced way. “Amodei’s call for an evidence-driven approach is a necessary rebuke to the vibes-based policymaking that characterizes the legislative hearings I’ve been a part of at many state capitals.”
