Today, let’s talk once again about Meta’s scam problem [https://www.platformer.news/r/6f8edd62?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670].

Reuters reported [https://www.platformer.news/r/889e362c?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] that in 2024 Meta projected that around 10 percent of its annual revenue — about $16 billion — would come from ads for scams and banned goods. While the company faces fines for the prevalence of scams on Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, it generates more from the scam ads than it loses to penalties. 

Reuters’ investigation documented how the company limits its ad safety team from taking steps that would reduce the amount of scam revenue it generates. Among its innovations has been to charge suspected scammers more, on the theory that it will drive bad advertisers away. It seems like a bad theory, but it’s also a hugely profitable one, and so the so-called “penalty bids” remain in place.

On New Year’s Eve, Reuters’ Jeff Horwitz documented another strategy [https://www.platformer.news/r/169a4045?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] Meta has used to deflect attention from its scam problem. Meta has a public ad library that anyone can use to view and report bad ads; it’s a popular tool for regulators and journalists. In Japan, where the company was under regulatory scrutiny, Meta determined which keyword searches were most often used to find scam ads in the library. It then ran a “sprint” to purge bad ads related to those keywords.

It’s great that Meta purged the bad ads, of course. But the result was the creation of a kind of digital Potemkin village that made the company’s Japanese ad problem appear better than it actually was. And the project succeeded in its primary goal: to get the Japanese government back down from a threat to force Meta to verify the identities of its advertisers.

But Meta’s scam problem is bigger than any one country. And it seems that the company’s ad library sprints missed a few spots. In the United Kingdom, for example, the country’s gambling regulator easily found unlicensed gambling sites advertising to UK citizens. 

Here’s Olivia Solon at Bloomberg [https://www.platformer.news/r/a407a6fd?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]:

> The regulator has been checking Meta’s searchable ad library for operators that don’t have a license but are targeting people in the UK, according to a speech by executive director Tim Miller, delivered at the ICE gaming conference in Barcelona on Monday.
> 
> “It’s effectively a window into criminality,” Miller said, according to a transcript of his speech [https://www.platformer.news/r/9f378ca7?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]. “If we can find them then so can Meta: they simply choose not to look.”

The commission searched the ad library for the phrase “not on GamStop.” GamStop is a service that allows people with gambling problems to block themselves from playing on gaming sites.

Meta spokesman Andy Stone told me that just because an ad includes that phrase does not mean it is linked to an illegal gambling site. Some of those ads link to other kinds of mobile games that do not involve gambling with real money, and are allowed on the platform. The gambling commission has better information about this than Meta does, Stone said.

The company further said that it is “working closely with the commission to identify and remove all the flagged ads found in violation of our policies, and we’re using this intelligence to further improve the proactive detection tools we already have in place.”

But Miller said Meta told the gambling commission to use Meta’s own artificial intelligence tools — Llama, I guess? — to find and report bad ads. “The situation we all face is that regulatory resources or taxpayer money around the world is currently having to be spent on doing Meta’s job for them,” Miller said.

And it is a global issue. Earlier this month, Rest of World used Meta’s ad library to find illegal gambling ads running on Meta platforms in at least 13 countries [https://www.platformer.news/r/6c599908?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]. Dozens of pages ran nearly 1,000 illegal ads across the Middle East and Asia, according to the outlet's December analysis. Malaysia’s communications minister said in September [https://www.platformer.news/r/c877a67b?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] that it had submitted more than 120,000 takedown requests to Meta over gambling issues.

There are legitimate challenges in removing scam ads. Rest of World reported that gambling sites register as advertisers using fake addresses, and run ads for only six to eight hours before removing them and disappearing.

Still, regulators around the world are telling a story consistent with the documents that Reuters unearthed. Meta’s strategic under-investment in trust and safety has been hugely lucrative for the company, at the ongoing expense of its user base. 

On Tuesday, the Federal Trade Commission said it would seek to revive [https://www.platformer.news/r/52f1bdc4?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] its doomed antitrust lawsuit against Meta, seeking once again to unwind the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp from more than a decade ago. If the agency truly wants to do something positive for consumers, it ought to declare defeat on the heists that Meta pulled off all those years ago — and focus instead on the ongoing fleecing of Meta’s customers at the hands of its ad platform.

Writers react to Claude Code for writers

(See ethics disclosure [https://www.platformer.news/r/b14c874d?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]!)

Welcome to everyone who signed up after reading Thursday’s post on Claude Code for writers [https://www.platformer.news/r/85f63bd9?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670], which generated more new paid subscriptions than any in the past year. I took the long weekend off from vibe coding, and for what seemed like the right reason: the tools I built last week are actually useful, and I’m enjoying using them. 

It has been fun to see some of my more AI-skeptical writer friends weighing in on the post. Today in Tabs’ Rusty Foster [https://www.platformer.news/r/d8cfee91?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670], citing Struan Donald [https://www.platformer.news/r/60e29650?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670], worries that generative AI offers us the wrong kind of shortcut: the one that forecloses thinking in the name of expediency. (It absolutely does, which is why so far I’ve tried to build tools that assist with thinking: improving my recall, gathering context, and offering me starting points for discussion.)

At Deez Links, Delia Cai likes the idea [https://www.platformer.news/r/dae41c39?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] of a journal companion like the one I built to run semantic queries on my old entries. “While it does give me a bit of Luddite disdain to think about feeding my personal thoughts through some corporate tool, I can’t deny that it would be pretty much a writer’s dream to search around in your own thoughts like that,” she writes. “Until then, it’s my business and my business alone how and why I always get murderously despondent for the exact same 3 reasons for the rest of my life.”

Finally, at Garbage Day, Ryan Broderick asks: “Am I too stupid to vibe code? [https://www.platformer.news/r/67edc8bc?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670]” The answer: almost certainly not, though it does seem likely he is on the wrong plan. Rate limits on Claude’s free tier are punishingly low, and the next tier up didn’t get him much further. After shelling out for the Max plan, I’ve yet to get rate-limited, though plenty of more intense programmers do so constantly, at least if the Claude subreddit is to be believed. 

I liked what Ryan had to say about how vibe coding can be a gateway into learning:

> I did not know what an SQL database was, and GitHub’s interface used to give me hives. And through this process I have actually learned quite a bit about how to use them. That’s actually super cool! For whatever reason — perhaps by design — ChatGPT has never taught me anything about anything ever.

At the same time, he writes, vibe coding turns “the entire act of creativity … into a slot machine. One more pull on the AI and maybe it will figure it out for you.”

I want to protect the parts of my writing process that feel creative. But I don’t feel that way, at all, about the infrastructure that supports that creativity. I don’t understand how the plumbing in my house works, and someday that will surely create a problem for me. But I’m happy to call a plumber and trust that whatever it is doing will be more effective than anything I would have tried on my own.

Following

Elon Musk vs. OpenAI

What happened: A trove of documents from Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI has revealed juicy details about OpenAI’s for-profit conversion, and stoked more drama between Musk and OpenAI.

Emails, slides, and diary entries were released as part of a filing from [https://www.platformer.news/r/7fb50bc6?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] Musk’s legal team arguing that as an early donor to the OpenAI nonprofit, he is entitled to up to $134 billion in damages from OpenAI and its main investor, Microsoft. 

Musk’s team argues that the other co-founders transformed OpenAI into a for-profit venture against Musk’s will. OpenAI’s team replied with the transcript of a call in which Musk said he thought it might be good for OpenAI to become a “B corporation,” — its current corporate structure — and characterized [https://www.platformer.news/r/40435aa4?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] the suit as a “harassment tactic dressed up as a lawsuit.”

Other files released include [https://www.platformer.news/r/f7f7e2f3?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] a diary entry where co-founder Greg Brockman wrote he wants to be a billionaire. While weighing for-profit restructuring, Brockman wrote, “Financially, what will take me to $1 billion?” We also got more context on Altman's 2023 firing, including seemingly unjustified attempts to fire board member Adam D’Angelo and concerns about conflict of interest with the president of OpenAI’s current board. Plus there was a section of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s deposition where, when asked if OpenAI’s $500 billion valuation was justified, he said, “That was the willing buyer-willing seller market price, so I won’t argue with it,” before saying as an investor, he might squint at that number.

The documents also provide more detail [https://www.platformer.news/r/37bd028f?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] into the history of OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft — showing how under the terms of Microsoft’s initial investment, the company had approval rights over “major decisions” OpenAI made. Chats show Microsoft pushing OpenAI to release a paid version of ChatGPT earlier, and giving input into the choice of new board members during Sam Altman’s rehiring.

Why we’re following: Despite repeated attempts to dismiss Musk’s lawsuit, OpenAI and Microsoft will have to face him in trial this year. It’s not clear who will win, but in the meantime we're getting to read a lot of funny emails.

It’s also a valuable glimpse into how the one of the most influential companies in the world was founded. In this case, the documents show that basically everybody involved — including the co-founders and Microsoft — were less interested in OpenAI’s original, “democratic” non-profit mission than they were in acquiring money and power for themselves. A concerning look for the potential stewards of AGI.

What people are saying: In the wake of the documents’ release, Musk spent some time seemingly baiting [https://www.platformer.news/r/c3ccf5c5?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] OpenAI on his social platform, X. “Can’t wait to start the trial. The discovery and testimony will blow your mind,” he wrote.

Later, Musk started an fight [https://www.platformer.news/r/facbf753?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] with Altman when the former shared an article about a man who committed murder-suicide after talking to ChatGPT. Musk blamed [https://www.platformer.news/r/dc3860ee?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] OpenAI for the tragedy, calling it “diabolical.”

Altman replied [https://www.platformer.news/r/164a98d7?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] with a lengthy post. The problems OpenAI face are “genuinely hard; we need to protect vulnerable users, while also making sure our guardrails still allow all of our users to benefit,” he wrote. He thought Musk didn’t understand this: “Sometimes you complain about ChatGPT being too restrictive, and then in cases like this you claim it's too relaxed.”

Altman added jabs at Tesla, saying that its Autopilot feature had caused deaths and “it was far from a safe thing for Tesla to have released,” and said “I won't even start on some of the Grok decisions,” probably referencing Grok’s recent propensity to generate CSAM on X.

Entrepreneur Chris Bakke made a quip [https://www.platformer.news/r/4579eaff?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] about Brockman’s recently-released diary entries on X. “OpenAI team from 2017-2023: "hey - let's do some shady stuff… Greg Brockman: "perfect, I'll write it all down as we go."”

ChatGPT gets ads

What happened: OpenAI announced [https://www.platformer.news/r/d33bacbd?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] on Friday that it will begin testing ads in ChatGPT. The ads will appear on the free version and the newly-expanded [https://www.platformer.news/r/d4388f7d?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] $8 per month Go tier.

The company laid out [https://www.platformer.news/r/24b4a0ab?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] its principles for its ad approach, and said responses in ChatGPT will not be influenced by ads. Ads will be separate from responses and labeled, user conversations will be private from advertisers, and ads will not appear in the more expensive Plus, Pro, Business and Enterprise tiers. (For now!)

Why we’re following: For a company that has been losing billions of dollars every year — and has promised to spend more than a trillion dollars to build infrastructure — this move indicates the growing pressure OpenAI feels to reverse that trajectory. 

But it's a risky move. Most people don't like ads, and users will be watching closely to see whether the new commercial motives inside ChatGPT corrupt the core experience. The risk is particularly significant given that Google has promised to keep ads out of Gemini for now, and Anthropic seemingly has no plans to put ads into Claude ever.

In a separate blog post [https://www.platformer.news/r/c8779f61?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670], CFO Sarah Friar expanded on OpenAI’s business model, adding that “licensing, IP-based agreements, and outcome-based pricing” is on the horizon for the company. 

What people are saying: Tom Warren, a senior editor at The Verge, highlighted [https://www.platformer.news/r/2b947a3b?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] the difference in CEO Sam Altman’s philosophy a little more than a year ago. “I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us as a business model,” Altman said in October 2024.

DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis told [https://www.platformer.news/r/3cf132dc?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] Sources’ Alex Heath that the company doesn’t have any plans to put ads in Gemini, then offered a jab at his rival: “It’s interesting they’ve gone for that so early. Maybe they feel they need to make more revenue.” (Kevin Roose pointed out [https://www.platformer.news/r/5f9c2100?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] that Gemini is an ad-supported product, thanks to Google’s $100 billion quarterly ad revenue.)

“OpenAI has finally achieved AGI (Ad-Generated Income),” joked [https://www.platformer.news/r/46b37268?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670] Pedro Domingos, a University of Washington computer science professor.
