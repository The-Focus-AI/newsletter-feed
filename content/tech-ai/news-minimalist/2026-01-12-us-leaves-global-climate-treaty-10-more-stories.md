**[6.0] Trump withdraws US from UN climate treaty — **[**theguardian.com**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/07/trump-international-groups-un)** (**[**+115**](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/trump-withdraws-us-from-un-climate-treaty-e21e5107)**)**

President Donald Trump announced the United States will withdraw from the foundational UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and 65 other international organizations, isolating the nation from global climate cooperation.

The White House memorandum labels the UNFCCC and other bodies, including the IPCC and International Solar Alliance, as contrary to American interests. While critics decry the move as an economic and diplomatic setback, the administration argues these groups are dominated by progressive ideologies.

Though the Senate ratified the UNFCCC in 1992, the administration seeks to bypass the legislature. Experts warn this decision may permanently hamper American influence within the rapidly growing global clean energy market.

**[5.7] Iran's unprecedented protests gain momentum — **[**correiobraziliense.com.br**](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/mundo/2026/01/7331097-por-que-protestos-no-ira-atingiram-dimensao-inedita-na-historia-do-pais.html)** (Portuguese) (**[**+773**](https://www.newsminimalist.com/articles/irans-unprecedented-protests-gain-momentum-d00162e3)**)**

Unprecedented nationwide protests have reached a record scale in Iran’s 47-year history, with demonstrators demanding the removal of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and calling for fundamental regime change.

Sparked by a severe economic crisis and currency fluctuations, the movement has spread from major cities to remote towns. Unlike previous uprisings, these protests feature organized support from exiled figures like Reza Pahlavi, suggesting a more consistent challenge to the clerical government's authority.

Diminished regional influence and recent military setbacks have weakened the regime's standing. Increased vocal support from the United States and a reduced fear of state repression among the populace further distinguish this movement.
