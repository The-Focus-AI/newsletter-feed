OpenAI launches Prism, a free LaTeX workspace with project-aware GPT-5.2 editing built in
15,624 Likes
For years, scientific writing stayed fragmented across editors, PDF viewers, LaTeX compilers, and separate chat tools. OpenAI now releases
Prism
to unify that workflow in one browser-based environment.
The key shift is that
GPT-5.2
works inside the document itself, not beside it, with full awareness of equations, citations, and structure.
Prism builds on OpenAI’s acquisition of Crixet, a cloud LaTeX platform, and targets researchers who already rely on AI for scientific reasoning. OpenAI reports over
8 million weekly ChatGPT queries
on hard science topics, which sets the context for deeper document-level integration.
Key capabilities
LaTeX-native editor with live preview and managed cloud compilation
Project-aware AI that edits equations, sections, tables, and references in place
Built-in literature search with citation insertion from sources like
arXiv
Image-to-LaTeX conversion for handwritten or whiteboard equations
Real-time collaboration with unlimited collaborators and projects
How to use it
Log in with a ChatGPT personal account
Create or upload a LaTeX project
Ask GPT-5.2 to revise, refactor, or search literature directly inside the document

Build Custom AI Benchmarks for Free
As AI evolves at an unprecedented pace, measuring intelligence requires more than a few AI research labs alone. It requires the imagination and collective expertise of the global community
That’s why Kaggle has launched
Community Benchmarks
, a new way for anyone to build, run, and share custom benchmarks to evaluate AI models at no cost.
Highlights
Easy to use:
Our simple user interface – powered by the
kaggle-benchmarks SDK
– makes it easy to create custom tasks to test specific model abilities.
Free model access:
Run your tasks against state-of-the-art models from Google, Anthropic, and DeepSeek at no cost (within quota).
Powerful capabilities
: Support for multimodal I/O, multi-turn conversations, tool use, and built-in Assertions & LLM-as-a-judge
Leaderboards:
Group tasks into Benchmarks to generate public leaderboards that you can share & compare how different AI models rank.
Start building right away.

Google adds Agentic Vision to Gemini 3 Flash, enabling multi-step, code-driven reasoning on images
5,274 Likes
Traditional image understanding works in one pass. If the model misses a small object or dense text, the answer degrades. Agentic Vision changes the flow by turning vision into an active investigation that uses code as part of reasoning.
The core idea is simple. The model does not just look at an image. It plans steps, executes Python code to modify or analyze the image, then looks again. This loop grounds answers in pixels instead of latent guesses.
Google reports a
5-10% quality increase across most vision benchmarks
when you enable this mode.
How it works
Uses a Think-Act-Observe loop to plan actions and reprocess visual evidence
Executes Python code to crop, zoom, annotate, count objects, or compute values
Appends modified images to the context window before producing the final answer
What you can do
Inspect fine-grained regions in high-resolution images
Draw bounding boxes and labels to avoid counting errors
Run deterministic visual math and generate plots with Matplotlib
How to use it
Enable
Code Execution
in the Gemini API, Google AI Studio, or Vertex AI

DeepSeek ships OCR 2, an open-source VLM using semantic token ordering for documents
3,017 Likes
DeepSeek releases DeepSeek-OCR 2 to fix a long-standing weakness in OCR systems: reading complex documents in the wrong order.
Traditional vision models scan images like pixels on a screen, left to right, top to bottom. DeepSeek-OCR 2 changes that behavior by teaching the model to read documents more like a human.
At the core sits DeepEncoder V2. Instead of locking the model into a grid, the encoder first builds a global understanding of the page, then decides what to read first, next, and later. This shift matters for real documents where columns, tables, and forms break simple layouts.
What it does
Performs OCR, document understanding, and visual reasoning in a single model
Reorders visual tokens using semantic reading order rather than fixed raster scans
Why it matters
Avoids column hopping in multi-column documents
Preserves row-column structure when reading tables
Maintains label-value relationships in forms
Model and results
Uses a
3B parameter
vision-language architecture
