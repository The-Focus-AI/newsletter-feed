OpenAI introduces limited ChatGPT ads, rendered after responses without influencing model behavior
21,583 Likes
OpenAI
starts a new chapter for
ChatGPT
by introducing ads, carefully and with clear technical boundaries.
As ChatGPT scales to hundreds of millions of users, cost becomes the constraint. OpenAI answers that constraint by testing ads in the Free and Go tiers, while keeping the core model behavior unchanged.
OpenAI places ads after answers, not inside them. Ads exist as UI elements, not model inputs. They do not alter tokens, ranking, refusals, or reasoning paths, and model outputs remain independent from sponsorship.
Key features
Ads render
below responses
, fully separated from model output
Targeting uses
current conversation context
, processed internally only
No ads
for API, Business, or Enterprise users
ChatGPT Go
costs
$8/month
and expands usage limits globally
How to use
Free or Go users see ads only when relevant
You dismiss ads or disable personalization from settings

xAI activates Colossus 2, a single-site gigawatt cluster for frontier training
43,121 Likes
xAI entered large-scale AI training later than its peers, at a time when most labs already hit power and capacity limits. Training frontier models now bottlenecks on compute density, synchronization overhead, and time lost to fragmented clusters.
xAI brings
Colossus 2
online at
1 gigawatt
to train
Grok
, making it the first operational gigawatt-scale AI training cluster. This system already draws more power than
San Francisco
at peak and targets
1.5 GW in April
, with
2 GW planned
.
What Colossus 2 is
Single-site AI training supercomputer operating at city-scale electrical load
Built on dedicated grid connections, on-site substations, and liquid cooling
What it enables
Continuous large-scale training without cross-datacenter synchronization
Global batch sizes limited by optimization, not compute availability
Training regimes reaching
hundreds of billions to trillion-parameter models
How it is built
555,000 GPUs
purchased for approximately
$18B
Colossus 1 reached operation in
122 days
, setting the deployment pace

Cursor outlines how Bugbot scaled to millions of pull requests with agentic reviews
1,037 Likes
Bugbot began as an internal project at Cursor after coding agents reduced writing time but increased review load. Pull requests became larger, review time grew, and logic bugs escaped more often.
The team responded by building Bugbot and defining success as one concrete signal: whether engineers actually fix the bugs it reports.
Initial versions used fixed pipelines with multiple parallel model passes to control false positives. That approach improved signal quality but limited further gains.
The key change came when Cursor rebuilt Bugbot as a fully agentic system. Bugbot now inspects diffs, decides what code paths look risky, pulls additional repository context on demand, and uses tools to investigate issues instead of following a preset sequence.
To evaluate progress, the team introduced
resolution rate
, an AI-judged metric measured at pull request merge time that checks whether reported issues were resolved in final code.
What Bugbot does
Reviews pull requests for logic bugs, performance regressions, and security issues
Filters false positives using validator models and majority signals
Applies repository-specific rules for internal APIs and unsafe patterns
Results and usage
Resolution rate increased from
52%
to
over 70%
Resolved bugs per pull request increased from
0.2
to
0.5
Reviews more than
2 million pull requests per month
You use it by connecting a GitHub repository and running it on pull requests
