For years, Apple and Google have had a will-they-won’t-they type of relationship, as far as which AI company Apple would pick to underpin its Siri virtual assistant and give it new AI-fueled personalization and agentic capabilities. Apple has spent the last year or two playing the field, reportedly considering working with OpenAI or Anthropic to support the new Siri. But in a multiyear partnership announcement worthy of a The Bachelor-style finale, Apple announced that it would live happily ever after with Google — that the company’s Gemini AI models will underpin a more personalized version of Apple’s Siri, coming sometime in 2026.

But what does this deal actually mean for both companies?
