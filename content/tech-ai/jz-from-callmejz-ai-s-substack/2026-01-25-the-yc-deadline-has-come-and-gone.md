Investors look for traction – profits and users. But what if you’re not there yet? The key is to showcase your potential. 
Even if your YC application didn’t get accepted, don’t let those videos go to waste! Link them in the comments below.

Fear of not being creative? Own it! “I’m not creative, but I’m doing this because [your mission].” 
Posting your efforts isn’t just about getting investment; it’s about connecting with the people you aim to help. They need to find you.
What’s one thing you understand about this approach?
