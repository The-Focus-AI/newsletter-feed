* GO 1.26 RELEASE CANDIDATE 2 RELEASED 
( https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/6KZPBmTkX0E/m/56NuP1MaCQAJ )
 — Go 1.26 gets a little closer to its final release in a few
weeks with a fresh release candidate including several security
fixes in areas like archive/zip and Request.ParseForm. "Run it in
dev! Run it in prod! File bugs!" says the Go team. The draft
release notes ( https://go.dev/doc/go1.26 ) remain a good way to
get up to speed, as does Anton Zhiyanov’s Go 1.26
interactive tour. ( https://antonz.org/go-1-26/ )
  -- Junyang and Michael for the Go team

💡 Go 1.25.6 and Go 1.24.12 have also been released 
( https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Vd2tYVM8eUc/m/pQP7Bk0aCQAJ )
 including the same security fixes as 1.26rc2 above.

* ARE ATOMIC OPERATIONS FASTER & BETTER THAN A MUTEX? IT
DEPENDS 
( https://madflojo.dev/posts/are-atomic-operations-faster-than-a-mutex/ )
 — While atomic operations can be significantly faster than
mutexes, that speed comes with trade-offs in complexity and
correctness that often make mutexes the better choice.
  -- Benjamin Cane

* WRITING MUTEXES FROM SCRATCH IN GO 
( https://rybicki.io/blog/2026/01/01/mutexes-from-scratch-in-go.html )
 — Experimenting with other options to implement locks that are
lower level than just relying on sync.Mutex.
  -- Chris Rybicki

* STOP OVERTHINKING STRUCT POINTER AND VALUE SEMANTICS IN GO 
( https://preslav.me/2026/01/08/golang-structs-vs-pointers-pointer-first/ )
 — When creating a struct type, you can face decisions about
whether to use value or pointer semantics. Rather than debating
this case-by-case, why not establish a convention?
  -- Preslav Rachev

feature in Laravel, this library lets you print structs, slices,
maps, and more, in an easy to read fashion at the terminal. v1.9
adds optional field retraction, but other recent releases have
added other niceties like diff support, HTML output, and a
builder-style API for heavy customization.

( https://github.com/drpaneas/libgodc ) — The Dreamcast 
( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast ), released in 1999, was
Sega’s last truly innovative console (with a whole 16MB of RAM
and a 200MHz CPU!) and, amazingly, you can now build things for
it with Go, complete with support for goroutines, channels,
garbage collection, etc. The project even includes some games as
examples, such as a Pong clone. 
( https://github.com/drpaneas/libgodc/tree/main/examples/pong )

collate DMARC reports for you, but this gives you a single binary
solution complete with a Vue-powered frontend.
