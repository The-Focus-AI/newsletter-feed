Claudette Colvin died last week.

She was Rosa Parks before Rosa Parks. (
https://940e7a39.click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zuk0qpo7kfehpwwqwraxh6kd8l77a5hnxz09/vqh3hrhomd76zdcg/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcm9vdC5jb20vYWxsLXlvdS1uZWVkLXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtY2xhdWRldHRlLWNvbHZpbi10aGUtd29tYW4tMjAwMDA4NDQ1Mg==
) And if you’re an American, there’s a good chance you never
learned who she was.

On March 2, 1955, she refused to give up her seat on the bus to a
white woman. She was 15 years old and rebellious AF. Civil rights
leaders at the time consider her too much of a liability.

Nine months later, Rosa Parks, a quite, respectable older woman,
did the same thing. And she became the face of the movement.

Today is MLK Day in the United States. It’s important to keep in
mind how much of what Americans are taught about the Civil Rights
Era is centered around the feelings of white moderates and
conservatives.

Even MLK Day itself.

First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been
gravely disappointed with the white moderate.

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s
great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the
White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white
moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who
prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a
positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly
says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree
with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically
believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who
lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises
the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.”

Martin Luther King, Jr. was radical AF. White moderates and
conservatives obsess over his “I Have a Dream” speech (the only
one they seem to know) and his non-violent protect movement.

But he was a socialist and a working-class organization who also
understood that violence, white not something he personally
promoted, has a reason and a purpose as a tool for liberation. He
was becoming more radical in the years preceding his death.

I contend that the cry of “black power” is, at bottom, a reaction
to the reluctance of white power to make the kind of changes
necessary to make justice a reality for the Negro. I think that
we’ve got to see that a riot is the language of the unheard.

White folks love to point to MLK’s non-violent protect movement
as “the right way” to protest.

But remember: he was the single most hated person in the US at
the time. He and his supporters were stalked, harassed, arrested,
and beaten for protesting “the right way.”

As the punk band Bob Vylan sings…

White folks love quoting Martin Luther

‘Cause he held hands and prayed while they bombed his building

Good for him but the times have changed

And don’t forget, white folks still killed him

MLK Day was used to defang MLK.

Something I didn’t learn until recently was that MLK Day, while
being asked for by Civil Rights groups, was passed by Reagan.

He did it specifically to rebrand MLK (
https://940e7a39.click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zuk0qpo7kfehpwwqwraxh6kd8l77a5hnxz09/l2hehmhlqz9p8kf6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYm9zdG9ucmV2aWV3Lm5ldC9hcnRpY2xlcy9jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1wZXRyZWxsYS1yZWFnYW4tY3JlYXRlZC1tbGstZGF5LWJlY2F1c2UtaGUtaGF0ZWQtbWxrLw==
) from the radical he was into something more palatable for white
folks.

By 1983 Reagan faced an onslaught of criticism from groups such
as the NAACP and the Urban League for his aggressive assaults on
affirmative action and court-ordered busing. With a reelection
bid on the horizon, he began to make more concerted efforts to
pacify his critics and soften public opinion over his open
hostility to civil rights. The King holiday was the primary
component of this effort.

Reagan’s pivot on the King holiday provided a two-pronged
benefit. On the one hand it would pacify critics of his positions
on civil rights, but on the other it enabled Reagan to position
himself as the inheritor of King’s colorblind “dream”—a society
in which “all men are created equal” and should be judged “not …
by the color of their skin, but by the content of their
character”—in order to advance the anti-black crusade he had
waged since the 1960s, now under the alluring mantle of
colorblindness.

So when…

* You see some chucklefuck on Fox News talking about MLK today,
quoting that one speech and ignoring what the man himself fought
for.
* You realize you were never taught the real MLK in school.
* You learn about America’s rich history of radical black
figures.

Remember that this is 50+ years of deliberate disinformation by
both conservatives and “moderate liberals” to maintain power and
suppress black liberation.

As F.D. Signifier says, these are not unprecendented times. (
