One of the recurring themes in the Dungeon Crawler Carl book
series (
https://940e7a39.click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vu468kxd4a9h9n2e0otlhvze4k55hnhn6mql/08hwh9h2nogozgal/aHR0cHM6Ly9nb21ha2V0aGluZ3MuY29tL2R1bmdlb24tY3Jhd2xlci1jYXJsLw==
) is that your enemies aren’t people, they’re systems of power.

In the books, nearly everyone is a victim, including the monsters
and NPCs they fight. The real baddies are the super wealthy, who
create systems of power to pit the poor against each other.

It reminds me a lot of life, and that’s on purpose.

---------------
The wrong enemy
---------------

There’s this scene in the Pixar movie A Bug’s Life (
https://940e7a39.click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vu468kxd4a9h9n2e0otlhvze4k55hnhn6mql/vqh3hrhomxexg8hg/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1WTGJXbkpHbHlNVQ==
) where Hopper, the main villain, says…

Those puny little ants outnumber us 100-to-1. And if they ever
figure that out, there goes our way of life.

Nearly every system of oppression that exists today is designed
to pit people who share the same struggles against each other so
that we fight among ourselves instead of uniting to dismantle
systems of power.

Race? Made up. Social construct.

Don’t get me wrong: racial struggles and identity absolutely
exist. But there’s no biology around race. It’s a social
construct that was made up to justify the subjugation,
enslavement, and abuse of various groups of people (by deeming
them biologically inferior in some way).

Immigrants aren’t the reason you can’t find a job. Trans kids
aren’t the reason your kid didn’t make the varsity team. Black
people aren’t the reason you didn’t get into your top choice for
school.

We are all fighting for crumbs that fall from the overloaded
trough of the rich.

--------------------
No good billionaires
--------------------

Just before Christmas, Taylor Swift donated $1 million to Feeding
America.

She got a lot of praise for it. It’s a lot of money.

It’s also 0.0625 percent of Taylor’s wealth. If you make $100,000
a year, it’d be like you donating $62, but makes an even smaller
impact on her life than it would yours.

After that, Taylor still has $1,599,000,000 left over. It makes
no material difference to her life whatsoever.

People were not happy when I pointed this out.

It was still a good thing, Taylor is “poor” by billionaire
standards, and she does far more good than most.

But the mere fact that she is a billionaire at all—that anyone
is—is the problem.

-----------------------------
Billionaires should not exist
-----------------------------

I’m going to pick on Taylor Swift for just a few more minutes,
though there are far more deserving targets.

* Taylor has multiple gigantic homes that sit empty a majority of
the year… while thousands of people sleep on the streets every
night.
* Taylor owns (or owned) multiple private jets, while millions of
people don’t know where their next meal is coming from.
* Taylor Swift made $190 after taxes from her last tour. The
median income in the US in 2021 was $37,586.03.

That level of disparity is shocking.

Billionaire math is wild. Let’s say you make $100k a year.

* It would take you 10 years to make $1 million.
* It would take you 10,000 years to make $1 billion.

Billionaires should not exist. No one should have that much
money. Not while people starve and die of exposure and
preventable medical issues.

------------------
Philanthropy is PR
------------------

Is that $1 million Taylor donated going to feed a lot of people?
Of course it is!

But she could personally wipe out hunger in the US for a year if
she wanted to and still have absurd amounts of “go fuck yourself
I’m taking a private flight to space” money… if she wanted to.

When the rich do philanthropy, it’s brand sanitization. It’s PR.

It’s why so many people fought me to tell me “how good of a
person Taylor is for doing stuff like this.” Yes, this is good.
It’s not nearly enough.

It’s what allows Taylor to pollute the planet with her jets and
hoard empty houses like a dragon does gold. By throwing a few
crumbs to the masses every now and then.

----------
Solidarity
----------

It’s important for us to cultivate class solidarity. Everyone who
works for money shares the struggle.

This is not to say class is the only thing that matters. Race,
gender, sexuality, and so on all intersect with class and create
additional struggles and issues and nuances and layers.

Don’t be an asshole. Be intersectional.

But recognize that you have far more in common with your fellow
workers than you do differences.

Share your salary. Have people’s backs. Build coalitions. Use
whatever privilege you have to stand up for people with less of
it.

Stand together and fight the system.
