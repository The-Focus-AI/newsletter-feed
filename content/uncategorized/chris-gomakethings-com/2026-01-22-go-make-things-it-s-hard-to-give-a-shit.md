# [Go Make Things] It's hard to give a shit

I’m finding it pretty much impossible to give a shit about
anything web dev or tech related right now.

Today, I want to rant for a minute, and then offer some pragmatic
advice.

----------------
Everything sucks
----------------

The world has been pretty bad for a while.

The juggernaut of environmental collapse. The flood of refugees
into Europe (and their horrific treatment by the countries that
colonized and destabilized their home countries). The assault on
Ukraine. The genocide of Palestine. The civil war in Sudan.

And most recently, the fascist takeover of my country, the United
States, and the rampant abuses committed by the ICE gestapo.

Why would I give a single fuck about the best way to render
content with web components or the latest tech drama when Nazi
bootlickers are literally kicking down doors without warrants and
kidnapping my neighbors?

But under capitalism, it’s all “dance, monkey, dance.”

You’re expected to wake up every day, but on a fucking smile, and
grind out more code widgets to keep capital flowing up so that
crumbs can trickle down.

Ok, pitty party over. Let’s talk tactics.

------------------------
Give a shit about people
------------------------

One of the most anti-fascist things you can do is give a shit
about people.

Like, truly, genuinely care.

Learn your neighbors names. Buy tents and sleeping bags for the
unhoused. Start a little free pantry or community fridge. Buy
groceries or deliver meals to people in your town who can’t
drive. Shovel driveways.

Throw parties. Make boring infrastructure pretty with stickers or
chalk or paint.

Fascism hates joy.

You can also buy and distribute whistles (

) and generally be dirt in the cog (

) whenever possible.

----------------------------
Help people. Attack systems.
----------------------------

This is a lesson straight from the Dungeon Crawler Carl book
series (
https://940e7a39.click.convertkit-mail2.com/mvu2xk8lw2h5hq25xortmhrk950qqb3he0or6/8ghqhohowl68g0uk/aHR0cHM6Ly9nb21ha2V0aGluZ3MuY29tL2R1bmdlb24tY3Jhd2xlci1jYXJsLw==
).

First, recognize that you can’t save everyone, but you can fight
like hell to help the people you can.

Second, understand that systems are the real enemy, and often
shitty people are doing bad shit because shitty systems force or
encourage them too.

That doesn’t mean you should go all kumbaya and hug it out with
Nazis. But recognize that until you destroy the system, cutting
off one head of the hydra just causes two more to grow.

And if you’re feeling strong, and even more so if you’re not,
repeat Carl’s mantra…

You will not break me, fuck you all, I will break you.

Stay strong, friends! ✊

content.

Cheers,
