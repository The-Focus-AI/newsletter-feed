Dear Classical Wisdom Reader,
Just wanted to make sure you didn’t miss our emails from earlier...
We reached out this week to offer you a special $20 Off voucher… to be used toward an annual Classical Wisdom membership.
Our records indicated you’re one of our “active readers,” so we wanted to make sure you had a chance to see the invitation...
Right now, you still have a few hours (9 hours at time of writing) to claim your $20 Off discount voucher.
That gets you access to all our resources, including our expansive eBook library, monthly Classical Wisdom Litterae magazines, Podcasts with Professors, live webinars (like the one we just hosted with famed translator Emily Wilson), and Members Only invites to our exclusive tours and voyages around sites of the ancient world...
…all for less than $1 per week.
Supporting Classical Wisdom has never been so easy!
As long time readers know, we rarely make special offers like this, so it’s a great opportunity to join our community of Classics lovers.
So grab your $20 Off voucher and join us today…
And as always, thanks again for being part of our mission to bring ancient wisdom to modern minds.
All the best,
Anya Leonard
Founder and Director
Classical Wisdom
P.S. Many folks don’t know this, but when you lock in this discounted rate on Substack… that’s your price, for life.
In other words, in the highly likely event we continue to expand our resources (and thereby raise our price) in the future… you’ll never be charged above your discounted rate of less than $1 per week.
You can also pause billing at any time, for whatever reason… and your low, discounted rate will be reserved until you decide to resume your membership. There’s really never been a better time to enjoy the wisdom of the ancients.
Join Classical Wisdom and lock in your lowest, lifetime rate, today…
