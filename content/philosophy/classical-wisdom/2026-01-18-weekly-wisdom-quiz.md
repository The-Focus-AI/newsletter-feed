Dear Classical Wisdom Reader,
The rise of an empire and the fall of civilizations… 
Just another week at Classical Wisdom!
From the Mycenaeans and the Minoans, to the clash of powers at Actium, we looked at the beginnings and endings of some of the most important eras in ancient history.

As always, all questions are based on articles and resources published this week here at Classical Wisdom. A full roundup is available after the quiz, along with with the answers.
