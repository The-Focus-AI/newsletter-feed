Dear Classical Wisdom Reader,
If you read the papers today, the situation looks pretty grim. It’s a world full of division and hatred, violence and lies. Corruption is common, propaganda ever present and the polarization seems to increase with each passing day.
And yet, here at Classical Wisdom, I am honored to say we have the nicest corner on the internet. With over 100,000 people in 200 countries, covering every race, religion, political position and creed... 
And still:
Instead of attacks, there is civil discourse...
In lieu of division, there is cooperation...
In place of perpetuating falsehoods, there is a seeking of truth...
Underneath it all, there is the shared telos, the goal of understanding the world, ourselves, and each other better. Together we are living the examined life by engaging with these ancient ideas, by asking the important questions.
And I see this. 
I see it in the comments, at our webinars and events, even in real life when I get to meet dear readers on our trips and tours.
Our community truly is a collection of interested and interesting people.
And so, today as we near the end of our Special Offer of 30% OFF,  I’d like to pass the mic, so to speak, and put your fellow Classical Wisdom readers on the center stage. 
Here are just a few of the hundreds of notes and comments I receive (indeed, these are just the most recent...and please know, I love and read them all!!)
So join our community, where curiosity abounds, civil discourse reigns and the Great Conversation takes place. In fact, you can do so…
... for less than $1 per week.
That is, until midnight this Sunday, February 1, the first US$20 toward your Classical Wisdom membership is on us.
At that price, membership comes to less than 15 cents a day…
Remember, that gives you full access to our extensive eBook library, with titles from the likes of Plato, Aristotle, Euripides, Sophocles, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Cicero and more, right at your fingertips...
Plus in-depth, Members Only articles each and every week (like this week’s article on how stoic philosophy can help us through difficult times)...
You also gain access to Podcasts with Professors, where we speak with some of the leading classical minds from the world’s top universities...
Along with early bird access to our exclusive, invitation-only tours, like the “In Search of Homer” voyage with famed translator, Emily Wilson, whom we interviewed last week and even visited on tour in Kefalonia, Greece, last year...
There’s a whole world of wonder and excitement to explore through your Classical Wisdom membership...
We swim in the deep waters of ideas, history, philosophy and mythology... and we’d love to have you with us.
Kind regards,
Anya Leonard
Founder and Director
Classical Wisdom
