Dear Classical Wisdom Reader,
It’s a mad, mad, mad, mad world. Perhaps you’ve noticed?
While political violence and public folly are on the rise... attention spans and common sense are fast declining.
What was once a sense of community steadily devolves into petty partisanship.
In a world of ‘bread and circuses,’ we watch as shared values give way to personal newsfeeds all while anti-social media drives us apart, divides us into competing factions, and pits us against one another.
It’s a bleak picture, to be sure... but it’s nothing new.
Moreover, if history is any guide, it’s nothing we can’t overcome... if only we take the time to learn from our predecessors.
After all, it’s not like the ancients lived exclusively in times of peace... saw nothing of political strife and social upheaval... or forgot to ask the Big Questions:
What is the nature of existence?
What does it mean to lead a good life?
On what founding principles should we base our society, in order to maximize happiness and minimize suffering?
On these important questions – and many more besides – the ancients fought and squabbled, they debated and pontificated...
... and they left invaluable texts for us, their distant progeny, to contemplate and study... or to ignore at our peril.
Here at Classical Wisdom, we believe that everyone should have access to these age-old lessons... which is why, for the next few days only, we’re offering active readers like you the opportunity to join our Classical Wisdom community...
... for less than $1 per week.
That is, until midnight this Sunday, February 1, the first $20 toward your Classical Wisdom membership is on us.
At that price, membership comes to less than 15 cents a day... a price we hope you’ll agree is reasonable to unlock the invaluable wisdom of the ancients.
Remember, that gives you full access to our extensive eBook library, with titles from the likes of Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Cicero and more, right at your fingertips... 
At that’s just from this week’s Stoic Philosophers Ebook!
Plus in-depth, Members Only articles each and every week (like yesterday’s article on how stoic philosophy can help us through difficult times)...
You also gain access to Podcasts with Professors, where we speak with some of the leading classical minds from the world’s top universities...
Along with early bird access to our exclusive, invitation-only tours, like the “In Search of Homer” voyage with famed translator, Emily Wilson, whom we interviewed last week and even visited on tour in Kefalonia, Greece, last year...
There’s a whole world of wonder and excitement to explore through your Classical Wisdom membership...
Think of it like having an entire classical library at your fingertips... to access whenever you want it.
The guiding words of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle... the epic plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides... the poems of Homer and Virgil... the vast mythological cannon... the history of the greatest wars ever fought... and plenty more...
… all for less than $1 per week.
Dear reader, it is not in times of plenty that we stand most in need of Classical Wisdom... but in times of hardship, both at the societal and individual level.
Don’t let the moment pass you by. Accept our special “$20 Off For Life” invitation today, gain the perspective of the ancients, and join our Classical Wisdom community, right here...
Thank you for being a part of our mission of bringing ancient wisdom to modern minds. 
Kind regards,
Anya Leonard
Founder and Director
Classical Wisdom
