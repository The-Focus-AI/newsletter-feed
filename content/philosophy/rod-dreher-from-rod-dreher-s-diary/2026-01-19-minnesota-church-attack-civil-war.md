When I use the term “Weimar America,” I’m not talking about the Nazification of the United States. In fact, it was the formal accession to power of the National Socialists in 1933 that ended Germany’s Weimar Republic. No, I’m talking about the similarities between what happened in Germany, 1918-33, and what is happening in the US today — that is to say, the analogous events that produced mass psychosocial instability, resulting, ultimately, in a turn to totalitarian government.
What happened at church in Minneapolis yesterday is pure Weimar America. Look:
An anti-ICE mob of protesters burst into a Baptist church service in Minneapolis yesterday during services. The pastor also works for ICE. They took it upon themselves, these protesters, to violate the sanctuary to make a political point. And guess who they had with them? Former CNN host Don Lemon, who was egging them on. If you want a shorter version, this tweet  contains footage from Lemon’s livestream. In this clip , you can hear Lemon directing protesters, saying, “Disrupt. Make them uncomfortable.”
And look at this: 
Denny Burk tweets  (video at the full tweet):
What is the FACE Act? According to Wikipedia:
The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE or the Access Act, Pub. L.  No. 103-259, 108 Stat. 694) (May 26, 1994, 18 U.S.C.  § 248 ) is a United States law that was signed by President Bill Clinton  in May 1994, which prohibits the following three things: (1) the use of physical force, threat of physical force, or physical obstruction to intentionally injure , intimidate, interfere with or attempt to injure, intimidate or interfere with any person who is obtaining an abortion , (2) the use of physical force, threat of physical force, or physical obstruction to intentionally injure, intimidate, interfere with or attempt to injure, intimidate or interfere with any person who is exercising or trying to exercise their First Amendment  right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship , (3) the intentional damage or destruction of a reproductive health care facility or a place of worship.
Here, courtesy of one of the activists, are some of those responsible for this. US Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon has already announced a federal investigation of this incident. I expect these people will all be receiving visits from the feds. Hope so:
You all should be aware that an important line — legally and psychologically — has been crossed here, with this invasion of a place of worship during services. 
The beginning of the process that led to the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s was the widespread desecration, in 1931, of churches and convents by left-wing anarchists and other anticlerical groups, shortly after the fall of the monarchy. They even pulled the corpses of dead nuns out of their coffins and dragged them onto the street to mock:
This is how much the Spanish anarchists hated the Catholic Church, and Christianity. The new left-wing Republican government responded passively. This initiated a cycle of violent retribution. By 1936, it was war.
The desecration of what one’s opponents hold sacred is such a critical event because it is felt, and felt very deeply, as an attack on the target group’s very identity. History is filled with examples of militants desecrating holy sites as part of a broader war. For example, Serbian forces damaged or destroyed 1,000 Bosnian mosques in the 1990s, in an attempt to intimidate and to erase Muslim presence there. We know how that ended. 
I will never forget what a friend of mine, an American officer who served there later as part of a UN peacekeeping force, told me about going into a wooden barn in which the Serbs massacred hundreds of Bosnian Muslim men in a mass shooting. The shooting had happened some time earlier, but he said the walls were covered with a black slime — mold feeding off the blood and viscera embedded in the walls. He said it was the most horrible thing he had ever seen. 
As I wrote yesterday from Heathrow,  things are fast getting out of control in Minnesota. Leftist mobs are going after innocent people they think might be pro-ICE — including a tourist driving a rental car with Texas plates. The mob figured Texas plates surely must belong to an ICE agent. State and local authorities there have put themselves openly against federal law enforcement. It’s as if they’re all but begging Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act — and you know, if all this isn’t an insurrection, what is it?
What these fools don’t understand is that things like invading and disrupting a church service compels many Christians and others, who might have been doubtful about the Trump administration’s approach to immigration enforcement, to rush towards Trump for protection from the mob. They are hardening sides. Frankly, I hope the feds swoop in with force and start mass arrests, starting with Don Lemon. Again: the protesters crossed a bright red line yesterday in going into that church. 
This is how civil wars start. I’m serious. Here is a clip of an anti-ICE leftist standing on the streets of Minneapolis with a rifle in hand, ready for civil war.  He says he’s standing on his block “to protect my people.” OK, but is he ready for Christian men to stand around the perimeter of their churches, with rifles, to protect their people?
