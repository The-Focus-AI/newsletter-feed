Gang, whatever you do today, make time to watch this new 40-minute documentary, The Remnant: The Last Christians Of Denmark ,  about a small rural community of Danish Lutherans and Catholics, Millennials who got fed up with the apathy and lifelessness of post-Christian society, and who moved to the country to live with their kids in Christian community. They’re mostly Lutheran families, but there are also two Catholic ones (I found this out by writing to Mikkel, one of the men in the film — that’s him on the right in the image above), but like Kierkegaard, reject the bourgeois, unbelieving comfort of the official state church. They’re living an ecumenical Christian Benedict Option, in one of the most secular countries in the world. I’ve reached out to the director, and am going to try to go visit them.
I’m making this available to the entire subscription base, because I want to spread the word about these good people. Mikkel Sotbaek, one of the fathers, says at one point in the film, “I have no money, but I am a rich man.” Indeed he is. In his email to me, Mikkel said:
As for what more I might add: we bought our farm ten years ago, dreaming of a more natural and traditional life, prioritizing nature, tradition, and family. Now my wife and I are 30 years old, and we have five children. We have been immensely blessed and fortunate that other families have joined us as well.
We are a community centered primarily on shared values and a shared faith, albeit not a shared confession. Two of the families are Roman Catholic, but they share the same historic core creeds as we do. Of course, this is still, in a sense, a significant handicap. True community cannot fully exist in the absence of shared blood, tongue, customs, culture, and cult—if I may loosely paraphrase Herodotus—but we love each other, have much in common, and are mindful and respectful of our disagreements.
The reason these families did not play a larger role in the documentary, although they were present at the party, is that they preferred not to be filmed for reasons of privacy.
We meet once a week to spend time together, mostly the mothers and the children of the community, and then many times throughout the year as entire families to eat together and enjoy our community. In addition to this, we also visit one another privately quite often and spend time together informally as well as helping each other out in times of need. It is wonderful.
We also have a looser circle of associated people who attend many of our gatherings or events, whatever one might wish to call them. All share the same traditional values, and all—with a few exceptions—are also explicitly Christian. Even those few who are not explicitly Christian nonetheless share the same fundamental values and ethics, which bind us together in a larger society that has embraced a fundamentally different worldview.
Mikkel invites you to follow him on X here: @potamopotos  — and to DM him through that account if you’d like to know more about what’s going on there. Their community is on the southern Danish island of Lolland.
Matt Eng is the young American filmmaker behind the project. Here’s his website.  
Another great cultural find: voice actor Jake Phillips reciting iconic passages from Shakespeare in a Southern accent.  I wish he wouldn’t call himself “redneck”; that’s not a redneck accent, but a beautiful Southern one. It’s almost like he’s channeling Shelby Foote. If you watch this, note on the side panel of his YouTube channel he has many other passages from Shakespeare, and others, recited similarly. For this Southern listener, it makes Shakespeare come alive like nothing I’ve ever seen or heard!
For subscribers — please become one! — today’s newsletter continues below. Boy oh boy, do we have a lot of news to talk about today: The nakedly political grand jury investigation of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, Cluster B personality disorder and the ongoing chaos in Minneapolis, and more.
