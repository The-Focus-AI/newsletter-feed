A quick note on a Saturday to draw your attention to a piece of mine  The Free Press  published today, in praise of the Apple TV sci-fi drama  Pluribus . Here’s the trailer:
Excerpts from my piece:
When people talk about totalitarianism, they think of gulags, George Orwell, secret police knocking on the door at night, and coercion, usually under threat of pain or death, to surrender one’s liberty.
But that’s not the only way to think about totalitarianism. When Aldous Huxley published Brave New World  in 1932, he imagined a totalitarian dystopia based not on cruelty and pain, but on providing the masses with so much safety, comfort, and pleasure that they contentedly exist as slaves.
Huxley’s novel begins when one Mustapha Mond, who controls Western Europe for the global government, hears of one John the Savage, a white man raised on an Indian reservation in the American Southwest. Brought back to London, the Savage, whose mind was formed on the collected works of William Shakespeare, inexplicably refuses to join the joyful collective, which is like an endless Carnival Cruise, without the mass brawls.
You all know what happens next. The Savage declines to join the perfect society, where everyone is cared for and peace reigns, because he believes that suffering, including the right to be unhappy, is key to being free, key to being human. More from my piece:
John the Savage is the spiritual forefather of Carol Sturka, the grumpy, middle-aged lesbian novelist in Pluribus , the brilliant new dramatic series from Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan.
The acclaimed show, which wrapped up its inaugural run last month on Apple TV, and has become the most-watched show in the streamer’s history, updates Huxley in the same geographical setting where the Savage grew up: the Southwest. In so doing, Pluribus makes the philosophical themes running through the nearly century-old novel graspable—and unsettling—for a contemporary audience.
Carol, who thinks she’s the only one in the world who is both immune to the virus and willing to fight for humanity’s right to be unhappy (thus free), discovers she has a confederate — a tough Catholic man from South America:
The real Savage emerges later in the Pluribus narrative: Manousos Oviedo (Carlos-Manuel Vesga), a Colombian living in Paraguay, who has from the beginning refused all contact with both the Others and the immune community, declining Carol’s outreach. Without giving away too much of the plot, let’s say that Manousos suffers intensely at one point, and is taken by the Others to a hospital for treatment. When he leaves, the medical Others smile and tell him his treatment was free. Furious, Manousos angrily writes an IOU, declaring, “Everything has a cost!”
It’s fair to say that Manousos is not a socialist. From context clues, he appears to be a Catholic. When an interviewer from Vulture pointed this out to Vesga , the actor readily agreed, saying:
There’s many kinds of Catholics, but I grew up with the kind of Catholic that accepts that life is hardship and suffering and strife, and in a way, that makes it worth living. I don’t think he approaches suffering and strife in the same way as other people who haven’t had that Catholic thing given to them from birth. It’s a way of seeing life in which you go, This is hard, but life is hard.
John the Savage had Shakespeare; Manousos Oviedo has the catechism as a way of life.
I’ll quote no more from the piece, except to say that it goes on to talk about its particular relevance to our time — an era and a culture in which people are willing to surrender the liberty and their humanity to be relieved from discomfort and anxiety. 
Please read it  — and to subscribe to The Free Press, which is home to some of the best writing being published today. As with this newsletter, you’re not going to agree with everything you read, but at least it’s interesting, and worth talking about, and thinking about. 
By the way, the copy editor changed my reference to the “noble Savage” to “ignoble Savage” — which is the opposite of what I intended. I’ve asked for a correction in the copy online.
A word about the comments section in yesterday’s newsletter. Apparently more than a few of you are angry at me for having questions and concerns about the way ICE is doing its job. I have long believed, and said here, in deportation. I broadly support what Trump is doing, and I certainly despise the way these activists are going about their protests. But some of you have decided that I’m now some sort of liberal because I raised concerns about SOME of ICE’s tactics — even though I cited polls showing that a majority of Americans are against what ICE is doing.
Gang, come on. This is the kind of purity spiral we associate with the woke Left. If we want the goal of deporting as many illegals as possible to succeed, then we cannot afford to lose the public on this — and we are losing the public. We have to be able to self-criticize, and self-correct, to reach our goals. If we can’t, we are going to find our heads handed to us in the next election — just as the Democratic Party’s enslavement to the demands of the puritanical activist Left helped cost them the last election. 
Beware purity spirals! To be a conservative is to try to live in the real world. I’m pro-life, as you know, but during the last right-wing Polish government, a conservative Catholic judge made a pro-life ruling regarded as extreme by many Poles. It brought huge protests into the streets, and likely caused that government to be voted out in a close election. Now the country is governed by the left-wing Eurocrat Donald Tusk. 
There’s a very good chance the Republicans are going to lose the House in the midterms; I’m not sure about the Senate. If so, it will likely because of the economy, not ICE raids. But our side can’t afford to lose votes. Moral considerations aside, if you want the mass deportations to continue, then you need to be concerned about how these raids are going down, and how our side is losing the propaganda war. In a democracy, it is not enough to be right; you also have to be persuasive.
Anyway, in this comments thread, I’d rather talk about Pluribus. If you haven’t watched it, spend the weekend binging — it’s a bit slow, but it builds. Carol and Manousos are such terrific characters, and the final episode of Season 1 has one hell of an ending.
