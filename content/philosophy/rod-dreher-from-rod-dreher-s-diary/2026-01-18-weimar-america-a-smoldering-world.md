Good morning from London Heathrow. Logged on to see what’s happening in the world, and wondered if it was too early to start drinking.
Nazis were on my mind, as I finished yet another book about Nazi Germany — The Nazi Mind: Twelve Warnings From History , by Laurence Rees, on the last two hours of the overnight flight. It’s a book about the psychological, and psychosocial, bases for Hitlerism. I highlighted these passages from a chapter about how the Nazi leadership prepared the SS, the Wehrmacht, and others to commit mass murder of civilians:
Given the heinous crimes they were about to commit, there is a tendency to think that the members of the Einsatzgruppen were all bloodthirsty sadists. It’s a comfortable way of thinking about the history, but it’s wrong. Whatever else motivated these killers, it wasn’t mass psychopathy. Two of the four commanders of the Einsatzgruppen, Arthur Nebe, head of the Criminal Police, and Walter Stahlecker, who had led security forces in Norway, volunteered for the job.9 The others were appointed, including the intellectual Otto Ohlendorf of the SD. He wasn’t the only cerebral commander within the ranks of the killing squads. In Einsatzgruppe A, eleven of the seventeen most senior leaders were lawyers; nine held academic doctorates.
The point is, people can be psychologically motivated to commit unspeakable atrocities. The entire book is about how the National Socialists achieved that. Thus:
Alfred Metzner, a driver for one of the Nazi commanders [in Poland], remembered that “pregnant women were shot in the belly for fun and then thrown into the pits… . And Walter Mattner, an officer charged with organizing a ghetto clearance, recounted his actions to his wife in October 1941: “I aimed calmly and shot with confidence at the women, children and numerous babies… The babies flew in great arcs and we shot them to pieces in the air before they fell into the ditch and the water … Oh, Devil take it! I’d never seen so much blood, filth, flesh. Now I understand the expression ‘blood-drunk’.”
Many such cases. 
Sat down in the lounge to spend the day waiting for my evening flight to Budapest. Opened X and saw this. Click on it to see the video:
Here they are at the club, doing same (that’s Andrew Tate’s brother Tristan, I believe):
“Hitler was f—king cool,” Fuentes has said. You know, the man ultimately responsible for his agents throwing Jewish and Polish babies into the air and shooting them to shreds before they hit the ground.
There is not enough irony in the world to legitimize what these scumbags in Miami did. What Fuentes and his growing group of followers among the influencers are doing is conditioning people to see Jews as subhuman. It’s more than a little strange that black people like Kanye West, Sneako, and Tristan Tate participate in this, as it was the same rationale that allowed “decent” white Southern men to whip, rape, and kill slaves, and after the war, lynch black men. But this is where we are in Weimar America. 
Do you think this is funny? Do you think this means nothing? When I was in DC last fall, a Zoomer conservative told me of a party in which affirming that you are an anti-Semite was the password to get in. This person is a white Christian. Her boyfriend is as well, and he’s so disgusted by what he’s seeing and hearing in his circles that he’s thinking of leaving politics entirely, and getting out of Washington.
Meanwhile, leftist mobs are rampaging through Minneapolis: 
When Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, this will be why. And when I talk about “Weimar America,” I’m not just talking about the neofascist young Right. 
According to The Nazi Mind, dehumanizing the Other is the first step to preparing yourself to kill them. This is happening on the Left and the Right. This was Spain just before the civil war broke out there in the mid-1930s. 
I’m also catching up on reaction to Donald Trump’s batshit attack on our European allies over Greenland, imposing tariffs , and promising greater tariffs, on European countries to force them to lean on Denmark to hand over Greenland. You need to read this long tweet from an X poster who warns Americans what destroying NATO,  as a Trump move on Greenland would certainly do. Excerpt:
Potential repercussions: If only a few of these materialise - it will be catastrophic for the USA.
 
Europe will immediately demand the closure of every U.S. military base on the continent. Ramstein in Germany, Aviano in Italy, Lakenheath in the UK. 
The US’s ability to project power into the Middle East and Africa vanishes overnight. They will be evicted from the very soil they helped liberate and defended for decades, and forced to retreat to their own shores as a fortress nation, isolated and friendless. Perhaps Trump may even forge new alliances with Russia and China.
 
Economically, the European Union is the largest single market in the world, and they will immediately be compelled to respond to it, under Article 47.2 TFEU - which is the EU’s own mutual defence treaty and framework.
Europe will likely move to call in U.S. debt and dump their dollar reserves, sending the value of our currency into a death spiral.
There are many more, all catastrophic. This is where Trump is leading us. I don’t always agree with James Lindsay, but this is an important post.  Excerpt:
To be maximally charitable and avoid serious concerns of real corruption, Trump is still running his comms and public image game like it's Trump45, but since Trump45 was a "thing," we've all been dragged through 5 years of INTENSE political and psychological warfare and destabilization. 
As a result, there's a divide. The sober majority doesn't want the kind of "thumb in the eye," "own the libs" style that made Trump45 fun anymore. We want an assurance through Trump47 that things can and will "go back to normal." 
We want a steady hand and clear leadership, and we're getting some of that, no doubt, mixed with a lot of dumb memes, official government shitposts, reckless (and captured?) influencers, bad decisions hidden behind "bad advisors," grifters, idiots, and what is obviously another huge psyops against us, this one "on our side," that the White House is either blind to or participating in (granted, "the White House" is like 5000 people, some of whom are on the less-sober side who like and promote this destabilizing idiocy).
The population is not the population we had in 2016 that was sick and tired of effete, pompous, elitist pseudopolitics. It liked "owning the libs" because it was funny and cathartic. Seeing the pomposity punctured and exposed was necessary and valuable at the time, destabilizing as it was to certain things.
In 2025, going into 2026, we have a different population. We're freaked the hell out and want to feel like we're going to get back on track, and Trump and his team are (for reasons beyond my comprehension that also must include corruption) have decided that we're in for another long season of psychological abuse that will result in a longer, darker season of even more of it that follows when the Democrats take back over as a result.
This is true, and far too many Americans are too drunk on self-regard to understand how this hurts our own country’s interests:
This is also true:
If hypocritical European leaders cared even a fraction as much about the sovereignty of their own countries, and its being compromised by mass migration, as they do about Greenland’s borders being threatened by the US, everything in Europe would change for the better. 
Really does feel like the world is on fire, doesn’t it?
