----------------------------------------

This is the free Monday edition of She’s A Beast [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/6a7e3bd7?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc], a newsletter about being strong mentally/emotionally/physically. Thank you for subscribing. 😄

These are dark times. Read here [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/68a66be3?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc] for what you can do to help from outside of Minnesota, and how to prepare if your area is likely to be targeted by ICE.

----------------------------------------

if only it were possible to know more about this book... oh wait [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/687a5b1e?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]

One of the first people I spoke to [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/4d993ec6?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc] on my book tour last spring was Mara Gordon, who writes for NPR. Gordon is a practicing primary care doctor in Philadelphia, and as we talked, I found she had a refreshing relationship with being a doctor, and how she saw her role in relation to her patients. She also seemed to have a lot of understanding about all the ways patients’ needs are not being met in America. Gordon even wrote an essay in 2024 about her specific challenges in being an anti-diet doctor in the age of GLP-1s being prescribed for weight loss.

I hear often from readers about their frustration and dismay with doctors, especially with regard to body weight, which many doctors still put at the center of patients' health picture. While many doctors are responsive to patients’ changing needs, dismissive and judgmental interactions are frighteningly common. (And, unfortunately, primary care doctors are often just the spear tip of an inept, broken, predatory healthcare system). With a closed-door situation like doctors’ appointments, I often find myself frustrated, because there’s nowhere to turn for information on how these interaction should go. Is he allowed to just say that? We all end up asking ourselves. Shouldn’t he be asking fewer questions? Shouldn’t he be asking more questions?

But Gordon is the unique doctor with clarity about this general problem, and I wanted to ask her for more of her insights on what is going awry. We spoke a lot about GLP-1s, the current axis point on which a lot of health discussion currently turns. She has an amazing perspective on what a functional doctor-patient-relationship looks like, as well as whether it’s possible. (It is possible, and it may be why your doctor is always running late.)

She generously spoke to me after a long shift, with her young son waiting in the wings to show her his new light-up sneakers. She’s A Beast thanks him for his patience.

----------------------------------------

 

I got the impression when we spoke last spring that you had notes for people in your profession, and the way that doctor/patient interactions go.

I see medicine and science as a tool for social issues. I've ended up in Philadelphia most of my adult life, but I sort had this dream of being a small time, small town doctor, having these long term, trusted relationships. I have that with some of my patients, particularly the ones I've been in my current job since 2019. I feel like I know them, their kids, their grandkids. But not everyone does, and that’s a huge cause of the disconnect.

As a patient, I could offer that I've changed jobs a lot. Changed insurance a lot. At a lot of points I would not have had the opportunity to see the same doctor more than once or twice, maybe, if I were on the ball in terms of appointments.

And it's normal, right? The idea that you live in the same small town for your whole life is just not what American life is like in 2025. People are more mobile, people switch jobs a lot. Their insurance changes a lot. Doctors leave practice, too. There's a lot working against us.

I hear from a lot of readers who have an above-normal BMI—quote-unquote above-normal, quote-unquote BMI [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/10ba4db2?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]. They’ll go to the doctor with health issues. The doctor will say, maybe you should try losing weight. And even if this patient is sort of game to do that, the patient will say, how do I do that, and the doctor will say, by eating less, and they’ll just flourish out of the room. (This was pre-GLP-1s as a weight loss tool; now it seems like everyone is eager to smash the GLP-1 button instead.) It’s like they revolve a lot of their care, or lack of care, around this one metric, but then offer little to no help to put those pieces together. What notes would you give to either person on either side of this interaction?

Very early on in my training, like as a medical student, it felt like it was my job to convince somebody to go on birth control when they didn't want to be in birth control, or to convince somebody to quit smoking, when they weren't ready to quit smoking. (Smoking is a little bit different from birth control and BMI, pretty clearly established to have a lot of harms.) Now, I describe myself as an anti-diet doctor, which has, for me, a very simple definition: I don't yell at my patients to lose weight. People were coming to me asking for GLP-1s, and I was like, I'm not an obesity doctor. I wrote an essay for NPR in 2024 about being a body positive doctor in the age of Ozempic [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/759c0631?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]. I think people think that they're going to fix so many complicated negative thoughts wrapped up in their bodies, size, and body image, and lo and behold, the medications do not solve that.

On the other hand—that doesn't mean I'm opposed to ever discussing intentional weight loss with my patients. When somebody comes to me asking about GLP-1s my first question is, what's your goal? What have you heard? I think a lot of doctors don't ask that question because our visits are so short. It's not that I magically have more time than everybody else. I just always run late. But pausing to help the patient define what their goals are is really useful, because GLP-1s are really, really good at a narrow range of what we call indications: lowering your hemoglobin A1C, which is a measure of blood sugar. Reducing inflammation in the liver related to metabolic dysfunction and fatty tissue in the liver. They are really good at protecting your heart, your kidneys. They do not solve body dysmorphia. That's not an indication. They do not work for that.

How, how do you drill down with them on whether a GLP-1 specifically are going to be right for them, versus another approach?

So I think taking the time without such a sort of explore, um, really tease out like, is this medicine going to address what you hope it's going to address? How can we explore those other issues? I see my role as planting seeds of curiosity, about how they can be medically healthy as possible, and what role does fatphobia in society play in their feelings, what role does physical activity or lack thereof play in how they're feeling?

I don't always leave a visit feeling like I have done an adequate job with that. But I try to at least open their minds to the idea that maybe there's more to work on.

Let me give an example. The patient I just saw before we started talking was a woman in her 30s and she works in healthcare, so she's highly educated on these matters. She’s super active, gotten into strength training over the last year. She has had persistently genetically high “bad cholesterol,” LDL cholesterol, for years, not enough to warrant a medication, but she's always been worried about it.

She brought up GLP-1s. I said, what are your goals? She felt she had a lot of food noise, she used that term, and said she loves baking, that food is her hobby, and was worried about that. She was curious about body acceptance. Worried that her thighs chafe in the summer. She feared a scenario where she is really unhealthy 15 years from now, and could have made a change earlier on. That's totally reasonable.

These conversations are more challenging the more cultural differences I have with a patient, but this one in particular just happened to be another doctor. I said, I share your concern about your LDLs. There is a step up from a cholesterol test I offered her, called a coronary calcium score, which is like a CAT scan of the heart that can see if there's like early signs of plaque in the coronary arteries.

And then the food noise. Kate Mann wrote a great piece for the New York Times, What If Food Noise Is Just Hunger? [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/a1fc15f0?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc] To be clear, I do think our food culture is really disordered. I'm not a relativist about whether these big corporations have our best interest at heart. I have three-year olds who come into my office at eight in the morning drinking a Capri Sun for breakfast. That's not great. But what if you just like baking cookies? There’s a fine line to be discovered between, what is enjoying and taking pleasure in liking to bake and eating cookies, and what's harmful, right? And I told her, only you can answer that question. And if you feel like it's causing you distress to think about cookies, that’s one thing.

And then, I wouldn't say this to all my patients, but I said to her point blank, do you get Instagram ads for Thigh Society [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/a1a8cf2c?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]? They work great. I endorse the product. If you can buy new clothes that let you avoid being uncomfortable in the summer, you should. And Ozempic is not going to fix that, right?

Which brings us back to, what is left for Ozempic to address here? These are not pat answers, to be clear, just all things for her to think about. But even “food noise,” even thigh chafing, even high-ish LDL cholesterol are not direct lines to an Ozempic prescription.

The distress aspect you mentioned is so important, I feel. For me, a huge part of my food and body issues was that I didn’t have a great index for distress. It turned out I was just always in distress, but I didn’t know it, because I was so used to it.

I find that an interesting aspect of some of this stuff, because people get worried about, for instance, giving structure to what they eat, or even, as you say, that they think about what they eat, or enjoy what they eat. They ask themselves, and me, does that make me disordered? But structure, or any feelings, is not what defines disorder. The disorder comes from like, A, is it negatively impacting your health and B, is it causing you distress? And if it is causing distress, then it’s bad.

But I empathize with not quite understanding the role of distress, because have a lived understanding of, when you don’t have a working internal sense of what distress is, that is a whole learning experience that you have to be open to, in addition to giving yourself the opportunity to find out what not-distress looks and feels like.

And I don't know the answer, right? There's clinical definitions of an eating disorder, which I don't think this patient meant criteria for, even remotely. But this is really hard to sort out, and I feel like it's really personal too.

So for this patient, did you end up prescribing her? Is she going home to think about it?

She's going to think about it. She said she was leaning away from it, for what it's worth. But I try really hard not to push people, because I don't want them to resent me. I never want somebody to feel like I have like an agenda. Particularly for something so widely available that does seem to be pretty safe in most cases. GLP-1s have been around for like 15 years. They seem pretty safe. It doesn't mean that they're always tolerated; a lot of people experience a lot of side effects on them. But that seems like a little bit of a straw man.

So what about the patient who doesn’t necessarily have any health concerns that speak to the use of a GLP-1, but they're asking about it, they weigh more than they want to, they are worried about hypothetical future health issues. You mentioned body dysmorphia comes up. How does that interaction go?

It’s challenging, and I I don't have a totally great answer. I mean, again, I try to approach all these conversations as, what are the goals? What are you trying to achieve? I have been asked for GLP-1s by a few people with sort of a moderate BMI, 27 or something, I don’t love this language, but a “healthy weight.” And I’ll say I’m not concerned about weight-related health issues for them. And I think helps assuage their concern.

I do think a lot of people are unsure if it’s “bad” to be a quote-unquote overweight BMI, in and of itself. My understanding is it’s not really quite proven that it is inherently unhealthy to have a BMI over 25, that being ten or twenty pounds “overweight” is not a deadlock for health issues, but that describes a ton of people who are made to feel very guilty about not losing that weight.

I would say like five percent of my patients have a so-called BMI that's “normal.” There's just tons of conflicting research on how much BMI impacts your risk of disease. But I think that being in the overweight category seems fine.

Sometimes people gain weight, and they're afraid of any weight gain. But it’s pretty normal to to gain some weight after, say, giving birth, and it's not necessarily pathologic. In my own approach, I try to reassure them.

I have to say, I've gotten out of a lot of these conversations because I work in a low income area, many of my patients are on Medicaid, or they're employees of the hospital where I work. I'm actually kind of desperate to get GLP-1s covered for my patients with diabetes, and they're often just completely not accessible to many of my patients, which is really messed up.

Either way, these medications just are not covered by insurance for someone with a BMI of 26 with no medical problems. I think a lot of those people are probably going to a lot of telehealth companies where you can lie about your weight.

So presumably you have had some patients on these medications for weight loss for a few years at this point. I've started trying to look into more about how people feel about the long term of GLP-1s for weight loss, if they are committed to it as a lifelong thing, or if they are trying to transition off of them. Or even what they are “supposed” to do, versus what they want to do. Is there a preferred course of action?

The party line from doctors is that these are lifetime medications. And that may be influenced by pharmaceutical companies. But people tend to not only regain weight when they stop them; this is reflected in the millions of of studies on GLP-1s. But also, their markers of cardiometabolic disease tend to revert to exactly what they were before.

It's funny, because I actually don't think I have that many patients who've been on them for years, because there are so many access issues. They're so expensive. The insurance coverage switches constantly. Philly, where I live, is a big healthcare town. And it was just announced that like the biggest insurer, Independence Blue Cross isn’t going to cover GLP-1s for weight loss anymore. It was too expensive. Medicaid is also switching things.

That's really interesting, that even if the companies want to position them as lifestyle drugs, that few people who really need them have even had the opportunity to make that happen.

Yeah. Which I think is bad. I mean, even though I'm, I feel like I have a heartache of skepticism about them, I think there are great medicines. They really can help people.

Are primary care doctors pretty much always like the point person for prescribing and then monitoring GLP-1s? Is there any other type of doctor that handles it?

The reality is a lot of doctors don't want to deal with the paperwork and bullshit from the insurance company. A cardiologist will write a note, should consider GLP-1, and that kind of thing gets punted to us a lot. It drive me nuts. They just don't want to deal with the bullshit from the insurance company.

But there are all sorts of avenues for it that are not me. Telehealth, as I mentioned. I had a patient the other day who wanted to pay out of pocket for a breast reduction, and it’s not covered by insurance. The surgeon said that he won't operate on her until she gets down to a BMI of 35. She cannot afford GLP-1s, and they are not covered by her Medicaid plan. So he is selling her compounded Zepbound, until she gets to the BMI that's his cut-off to do the cosmetic procedure. Isn't that just so gross?

Is there anything any sort of resources you wish were afforded to either doctors or patients, um, when it comes to dealing with each other, either in the specific respect of GLP-1s or in general?

I just wish we had more time. It’s just degrading everything, to be rushed. I feel like people sometimes sort of expect like Amazon style service; I do feel like the internet has changed people's expectations about customer service. I'll get messages that'll say like, I know my body, I know what I need. Send me this. And I’m like, hold up, let's talk about it. Doctors really need to shape up in so many ways, I of course feel like I have to earn their trust and respect. But your body is not a product that you buy on Amazon. It takes time and it takes care.

Also internet healthcare content. I had a patient with a high BMI who sought me out specifically as as anti-diet doctor. She was under the care of an ultra-specialized endocrinologist, a world expert at Penn, because of a rare medical problem that she had, had been tested for many related issues, was being managed really well. And she was like, I just think I have something else.

So I was trying to ask questions, to tease things out. I always joke that I play a therapist on TV. I asked, what are you worried that we're missing? Tell me what your fears are. And asked the same question over and over again. And after a while she turned to me and she's like, you know what? I think I've been overconsuming body positivity content online where everyone says doctors gaslight all fat people. I think if I had offered that conclusion she would have rejected it, but when she said it, I was like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

I think that narrative causes a lot of harm, and it’s worth being aware of that possibility, but I don’t think it’s generally true. So many people go to their doctors saying, I feel tired, I feel anxious, and I feel like I've gained weight. And while those problems deserve attention, they are also extremely common concerns that people have that are a symptom of being alive in America, and 99% of the time not an indication of like a rare illness, right? We need to sleep more, exercise more, eat more vegetables, not work so much.

What do you think the long term of GLP ones is going to be?

It’s hard to make a concrete prediction. But the sort of dramatic findings in the original studies, on GLP-1s for weight loss are difficult to replicate outside of the study environment. The reasons are complicated, and it’s not totally clear why. It could just be that people are sick of it. Anecdotally, I've seen a lot of patients discontinue them because the side effects can be really severe. The extremely high doses that produce the sort of dramatic weight loss that you see on TV can very, very, can be very difficult for people to tolerate. The side effect profile tends to be way more tolerable at lower doses, and there's absolutely cardio metabolic benefits at lower doses. They're the doses that we typically use to treat diabetes.

So do you think the maybe long term position of it is more as a drug that manages medical symptoms?

A different, bigger set of medical symptoms than diabetes. It reminds me of—cholesterol medicines are called statins, and basically everybody over age 60 meets the criteria to take one, they are so broad. As a primary care doctor, I've always been super nonchalant about them. But sometimes my patients don't want to take them, and I'm like, what's the big deal? They have no side effects, they can protect your heart. Why not? But for GLP-1s, the weight loss piece is so culturally fraught, so emotional, so tied up in misogyny, that it makes it hard to accept as a lifestyle drug. They are less stigmatized when they manage medical symptoms.

But cost issues, for the most part, are the biggest problem. I think it’s possible they're going to get a lot cheaper in the next 5 to 10 years, and likely they'll develop formulations that somehow make them more tolerable.

But in patients who do lose weight on the drugs, they can still experience negative body image, still experience, a lot of distress around food, still experience the negative things that they attributed to being fat. I think it can be really disconcerting for people. I still think we, as a culture, need to grapple with fatphobia. And until we do that, GLP-1s are not going to solve our problems.
