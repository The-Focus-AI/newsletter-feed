----------------------------------------

“Consistency” is a concept that comes up a lot in health stuff (it comes up a lot in a lot of things). The perfectionists among us interpret consistency to mean, you decide what to do and how often, and then you stick to that schedule religiously forever. If you don’t stick to it religiously forever, there is something wrong with you, or in fewer cases, something wrong with the schedule. There is a lot of literature about all the ways we can contort ourselves to achieve 100% adherence to whatever goals we set ourselves: 5 a.m. routines [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/6b75e10b?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc], meal preps, laying out your outfits the night before, sleeping with your shoes on.

As I covered in this past weekend’s paid subscriber newsletter [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/ea055817?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc], goals and metrics shouldn’t be bludgeons. They are directional arrows, and guidelines, at best. Much of the picture of ourselves as consistent comes from basic generosity. A better version of consistency is, when you look back in the long term, it’s what you did more often than not.[^1] If you wanted to go to the gym five times a week, and made it on average three or four times? That’s pretty damn consistent. If you wanted to go once a week, and went most weeks? That’s pretty damn consistent. If you are trying to eat healthy all the time, and you eat healthy two out of three meals? That’s pretty damn consistent.

It seems to surprise, or even elude, a lot of people how much imperfection and failure necessarily accompanies any amount of consistency. The imperfect self [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/a79c47a7?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc] is at the bottom of everything we do or don’t do, and the only difference is that we end up doing stuff, or not doing it. (I suppose the difference that stops people is having to confront the imperfect self if you do stuff, when you could otherwise not do stuff, and keep it safely buried at the bottom of the “doing-stuff” Pandora’s box).

But I feel it increases the burden of accepting the imperfect self when we are made to feel like we have to try so hard to ply it with all this effort and grind it into shape, before finally accepting, in great pain and after a lot of trouble, that the self is intractably imperfect in the end anyway. “Begin with the end in mind,” said Stephen Covey [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/08b31ce7?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc], the guy who made millions of fancy day planners [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/234cbad5?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc] that, I guarantee you, ended up mostly empty. The end I begin with in mind is that I’m going to fuck it up, and surprisingly, it helps me do what I do more often than not.

the Liftcord Pick of the Week

Eat

I am on record as a hater the “exercise snack [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/e0924daf?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc],” or the idea that you should try and squish your physical well-being into the grout of of your life. However, it is kind of useful to know that physical activity is not an all-or-nothing thing. The U.S. physical activity guidelines recommend two strength training sessions a week, plus at least 150 minutes of moderate activity (walking) or 75 minutes of intense activity (jogging) per week. But even a few minutes a day is better than nothing, and measurably reduces mortality [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/c551ed68?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc].

“One year I rode my bicycle across America, from San Francisco to New York. I started out camping in state parks, but past the Rockies, parks became scarce, so I switched to camping on people’s lawns. I worked up a routine. As darkness fell, I began scouting the homes I passed for a likely candidate: neat house, big lawn in the back, easy access for my bike. When I selected the lucky home, I parked my bag-loaded bike in front of the door and rang the bell. ‘Hello,’ I’d say. ‘I’m riding my bike across America. I’d like to pitch my tent tonight where I have permission and where someone knows where I am. I’ve just eaten dinner, and I’ll be gone first thing in the morning. Would you mind if I put up my tent in your backyard?’ I was never turned away, not once. [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/2ad5a449?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]”

Rest

I’m seated for every single thing that George Saunders does or says [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/a1f0dc99?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc].

Sometimes it’s hard to make people believe how very contrived the content world has become, as a result of terminal MBA brain that comes from prioritizing “engagement analysts”, chief marketing executives who base everything on data, and the like, over artists and writers. But here Matt Damon stating in unequivocal terms that Netflix wants its movies to audibly, plainly state the plot of the movie three or four times [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/f21da4cb?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc], for people who are playing the movie but not actually watching it. Diseased!

That’s all for this week! I love you for reading, thank you, let’s go—

[F1] It feels important to clarify that this type of consistency isn’t always enough. It's not enough, for instance, for a parent to pick their kid up from school on time, sometimes, and other times be late, and other times forget (speaking from experience as one of four kids, this a good way to make your child afraid every time you are not already there, that you forgot).
