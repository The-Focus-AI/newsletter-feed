----------------------------------------

if only it were possible to know more about this book... oh wait [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/9b9202cc?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]

As readers of my now-unlocked piece on collagen from 2024 [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/3d2674c0?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc] know, collagen threads a perfect needle for food and supplement manufacturers hoping to take advantage of the protein craze. Because it is made of amino acids, it technically gets counted into the protein figure on nutrition labels. But the thing brands really love about collagen is that it’s profoundly cheap to make and get, because it has no useful nutritional content.[^1] It is, as I wrote then, meat garbage. The margins are absolutely insane. Now, brands have figured out that they don’t have to make only collagen-based products. They can inflate the protein figure on any food by stuffing a little, or a lot, of collagen in there. The collagen/protein scam era is upon us.

Because of the types of amino acids it is made of, collagen does not meaningfully contribute to actual protein intake. It’s complicated to explain, but briefly: Protein is made up of different amino acids, like planes are made up of different parts. Whey protein is a whole plane, built and ready to fly. But some proteins are “incomplete,” just wings and landing gear, like rice. Beans are like the fuselage, tail, instruments, and everything else. When complementary proteins are consumed in enough proximity (within days) they can “complete” each other, so your body gets all the aminos it needs in balance and can synthesize those aminos into muscle.

Collagen is not only not a complete protein, like most protein powders made of, say, whey.[^2] As far as plane parts, it’s like a giant pile of the metal panels that make the underside of one part of a wing. Theoretically, other proteins could “complete” collagen, but the only proteins that could do it are proteins that already have all of the amino acids you need anyway.

This is supported by nutrition labels, if you look, and if they give more information than they need to. As Jen Gunter found at The Vajenda [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/75605c5c?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc], Mel Robbins’ new “Pure Genius” “protein shot” claims 23 grams of protein per serving, but 7 grams of it are collagen, and only 16 are useful protein. As I’ve explained before [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/9101c891?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc], while any essential amino acid content in a food counts toward the number of protein grams on the label, the “% Daily Value” figure only counts complete proteins (toward a recommended total of 50 grams for all adults; not a correct figure for a number of reasons [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/6aa307aa?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc], but I digress). This is why, for instance, the grams of protein in milk or cheese or chicken directly correlate—25 grams of protein in those foods will always be 50% of the “% Daily Value.” But 25 grams of beans, say, or rice, contribute significantly less to the % Daily Value than 50%. Collagen, a lot less.

This is why nutrition labels usually won’t even bother putting % Daily Value figures on collagen-based products: It makes them look bad.

We can do the same math for this jar of “Sturdy Sauce” pasta sauce [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/f2d61a0b?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]. It claims 20 grams of protein per serving, but the listed %DV for the protein figure is 15%. 15% of the50 gram RDA is 7.5 grams. Check the Sturdy Sauce label and, dun dun dun, “hydrolyzed bovine bone broth isolate,” a long and fancy term for, you guessed it, collagen. So of the claimed 20 grams, only 7.5 grams are useful protein. The rest is essence of hot ham water [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/86530d54?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc].[^3]

 

[https://www.shesabeast.co/r/0195cae4?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]

Collagen is not actually harmful (unless you try to survive on it [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/ed6c418c?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]). But it is filler. This is a problem for people who are buying products that claim to be infused with protein, hoping to notch a high protein intake because they are trying to build or rebuild muscle, only for the product to be mostly filler. Not to mention that these products usually charge a premium price. Protein, actual protein, is expensive to begin with, so it doubly sucks to charge a person extra money only for the product to be loaded with bone and skin juice-waste instead.

All of this assumes, of course, that supplement companies even feel like holding themselves accountable. There is a whole viral YouTube video from last week about a protein powder sent for third-party analysis, and the results came back that the powder was mainly flour and sugar [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/37606c12?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc], and contained a tiny fraction of the protein claimed.

I know it sounds like a shill-ish thing to say, but I take no money from anyone, so this how I’d suggest making the best of the eminently, continuously weird supplement situation [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/af555972?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc] in the US: If you want to use a supplement, use the ones that come from very large, established, old companies [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/85c6a62d?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc] (for protein powder, but also everything else). Don’t buy exciting; buy boring. It is far too easy in this country to “start a company” with a P.O. box and an LLC filing, fill up a bunch of tubs with sawdust, print whatever you want on the nutrition labels, go “whoops, haha!” when regulators come calling (an increasingly [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/82f0f04c?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc] unlikely event [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/884e1ef2?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc] these days), and vanish in a puff of smoke. I’m only mildly exaggerating.

And then if you don’t want to use any supplements, which is entirely valid and sounds like a better idea every day: It is very possible to get all your protein from whole foods [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/f244bbeb?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc], even if you are strength training to build muscle.

Collagen sits on a throne of lies
Or, how the supplement industry took meat garbage and turned it into a 9-billion-dollar business.…

The reason more women don’t look pregnant in dresses is because we’re contorting our bodies and causing ourselves long-term damage, sweetie!~

It’s been a difficult week for Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence. He went to a bar and met a woman, and long story short, she threw him across her shoulders and squatted him [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/163938d1?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]. People talked about it so much that he asked them to stop talking about it [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/19d36e29?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]. I don’t follow football, but I feel reasonably sure this might become the only thing Trevor Lawrence is known for.

I’m hearing “Orange Julius” protein shakes (orange juice + vanilla protein powder) are all over social media right now. Where have I heard of this before? Oh yeah; the She’s A Beast protein guide written in 2022 [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/128d53b1?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]:

I haven’t laughed so much in a long time as when I watched Richard Ayoade and Chris O’Dowd go on a mini-break to Vienna [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/c5c167b3?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]. Ayoade has exactly my kind of humor, which is based entirely on idiosyncratic vocabulary and syntax choices (yes, I have seen "The IT Crowd [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/95eca48d?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]").

[F1] If you want to argue some more about the supposed merits of collagen, I addressed everything else I didn’t discuss here over here [https://www.shesabeast.co/r/7211dc13?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc]. The short version is there aren’t any.

[F2] Protein powders can also be made of complementary protein isolates, like pea and rice. They can also just be one type of protein isolate: rice protein, hemp protein. But these single-type isolates are not, on their own, complete. Usually, people want and buy amino-complete powders so they don’t have to think about balancing things out eventually.

[F3] This was an earnestly ridiculous laugh line in 2006, and now it is plausibly the next TikTok trend that becomes the subject of a hundred straight-across reported pieces about whether hot ham water is really the secret to health, wealth, and happiness. I’m begging you, TikTok and everyone else, don’t do it.
