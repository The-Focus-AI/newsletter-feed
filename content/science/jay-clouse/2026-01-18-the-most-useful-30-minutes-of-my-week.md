Hey Will,

For the last three months, I've ignored the same item on my to do
list:

"2026 Calendar for The Lab"
It's a super simple task: There are a few tentpole experiences
that I know we'll be delivering in the community this year, and I
should put them on the calendar so we can plan for them.

...but I resisted.

And resisted.

It felt like this formalization of my creativity. Plans are
constraining! I just want to be punk rock!

It became this mountain in my mind of this GIANT THING that I
really had to put aside some time in order to accomplish.

It's January now, and this week I had some time that I "put
aside."

No more excuses.

And guess what? It took me maybe 30 minutes to complete. I laid
out dates for:

* Our Annual Town Hall (this Friday)
* Quarterly mastermind matching
* Our bi-annual Lab Reports
* Our next Offline event (June 8-9)
* New member welcome calls
* Our (first-ever) Christmas party

Here's why that's even more impactful than it seems at first
glance: Each of these tentpoles is a marketable event. Now that I
have a date for the experience, I can plan dates for specific
marketing campaigns to leverage the excitement of those
experiences, too. As I shared last week (
https://400c164b.click.convertkit-mail2.com/75up24ee8zu8h6d347vhzhweg7o66br9kxwerq927p95nkl5w5zdn3zp89dvgkx5pg697rkmmv2plggk09lenzxreqoe4zgpkzq60k6772n0z5g6k64g6g3pn0waomrlg/l2heh6ulqv7q7mhg/aHR0cHM6Ly9jcmVhdG9yc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vZXhwZXJpbWVudC1jb2hvcnQtdG8tbWVtYmVyc2hpcC1zYWxlcy8=
), in an evergreen membership, moments of genuine urgency are
rare and useful.

In 30 minutes, I created clear timelines for the most important
aspects of growing and sustaining our membership. None of these
periods will "sneak up" on me (as they did last year), and I can
make the experiences better and attract more people to them.

No more wondering, "When should I start..."

No more scheduling conflicts (because these are locked into the
calendar).

Now, I just need to deliver.

So let me ask you...

* What are the most important moments/deliverables of your year?
* Are they on the calendar?
* Have you planned how you'll promote them?

If not, it may be the most useful 30-minute activity you do this
week.

PS: As I shared, our Town Hall is this Friday! We do this once
per year. In it, we share what we added to the membership in
2025, our ideas for 2026, and ask the community for ideas and
feedback to further improve. Shortly after the Town Hall, we'll
begin our next round of curated mastermind matching. So, if
you've been on the fence, this is a great time to join (

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT ⏮️

Experiment: Cohort to Membership Sales

If you run a membership, you spend a lot ot time thinking about
how to attract more members. There are three well-known methods,
including:

* Scarcity: Limiting the number of people who can join
* Urgency: A looming deadline that necessitates a decision to
join now or wait until a future opportunity
* Status: Being a member builds self-esteem, or esteem in the
eyes of others

I've tried all three. In the first two years of The Lab, we had a
200-member cap. It was really effective in driving signups,
because those spots filled up fast. But that cap proved to be too
small—we wanted to increase geographic and topic density, meaning
we want more creators within driving distance of one another and
more creators focusing on Instagram, podcasting, or selling
physical products.

So, we removed the member cap and instead implemented an
invitation-only approach. Now, you must be vouched for by another
member or apply for membership. This was fundamentally to ensure
that we created a consistent experience—the Standard and VIP
tiers of The Lab were intended for professional creators who
already had traction. This way, we ensured the conversation was
relevant and useful to all members. But it also elevated the
meaning of being a member, adding esteem.

But what about urgency?

Given that the membership is evergreen (i.e., people can be
invited at any time), why would someone join today rather than
tomorrow, next week, next month, or next year? This is the
biggest challenge for evergreen memberships. What is the
mechanism for getting people to join now?

When you have an open-and-closed-door launch cycle, there's clear
urgency. If you don't join now, you will have to wait until the
next opening. But, if you don't want to do launches, what are
other ways to create genuine urgency for fence-sitters?

I recently ran an experiment to test one.

NEW EPISODE ▶️

Why Paul Millerd REFUSED a $200K Book Deal (And Self-Published
Instead)

(

)
Paul Millerd is the author of The Pathless Path, which has earned
Paul $325,000 in royalties to date. In the process, Paul turned
down a publishing offer from Penguin, one of the major publishers
in the industry. Then, in December, Paul decided to double down
and produce a new version of The Pathless Path, an ultra-premium
hardcover book that is just beautiful.

So in this episode, we talk about that decision, the dark side of
traditional publishing, the book deal Paul WOULD have taken, and
when traditional publishing actually makes sense.
