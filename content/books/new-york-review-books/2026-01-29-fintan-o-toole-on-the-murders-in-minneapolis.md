Darfur’s Endless War [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2026/02/12/darfurs-endless-war-el-fasher-tubiana/]

As paramilitaries tear through their already devastated province, self-defense fighters in North Darfur have taken up arms to defend their homes.

Teacher’s Pet [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2026/02/12/teachers-pet-in-thrall-jane-delynn/]

Jane DeLynn’s autobiographical novel In Thrall recounts a same-sex affair between a teenager and her closeted English teacher in the early 1960s, a time when exposure could be more traumatic than exploitation.

Anika Banister

Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams [https://www.nybooks.com/online/2026/01/25/wrap-your-troubles-in-dreams-yoko-ono/]

For six decades, Yoko Ono’s art has considered how we should live with ourselves and one another in an unknowable, painful world.

On August 29, 2017, way back in Donald Trump’s first term,  Masha Gessen wrote for the NYR Online an analysis of the new president’s autocratic impulses [https://www.nybooks.com/online/2017/08/29/trumps-hoodlums/], in particular his “encourage[ment] of extralegal violence.” These sometimes tacit and sometimes explicit incitements included the president’s notorious nod to the “very fine people”—neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and far right militias among them—at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a white supremacist had just killed a woman.

Masha Gessen

Trump’s Hoodlums [https://www.nybooks.com/online/2017/08/29/trumps-hoodlums/]

“Autocrats frequently rely on delegating violence to extralegal actors or, as in the case of Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, on the willingness of law enforcement officers to carry out extralegal violence in exchange for the promise of impunity. Duterte has made this promise explicit; more often, incitement to violence contains a tacit guarantee of protection.”

Life Storage [https://www.nybooks.com/online/2026/01/18/life-storage-new-york-city-cemeteries/]

“Most New Yorkers, for that matter, haven’t been buried in their immediate communities for close to two hundred years. St. Michael’s and other rural cemeteries were created to whisk the dead away from the city proper during a moment of panic over exponential urban growth. It’s never been easy to maintain graves here, with space in such short supply. The city piles on. ”

A More Pliant Chavista [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2026/02/12/a-more-pliant-chavista-venezuela-guillermoprieto/]

President Trump’s decision to support Delcy Rodríguez as Venezuela’s new leader makes clear that oil, not democracy, is his main concern.
