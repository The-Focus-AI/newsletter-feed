NYRSeminars presents Marilynne Robinson on the Bible

The New York Review is pleased to announce a new series of seminars on the Bible, hosted by contributor and Pulitzer Prize–winning author, Marilynne Robinson. Her first seminar on the Old Testament begins on March 2. Her second seminar on the New Testament starts on May 6.

The course as a whole is intended to draw attention to the fact that the Scriptures are, whatever else, a very great literature. Considering their importance to Western Civilization, it is remarkable how vulnerable they are now to misuse and ridicule.  Over centuries writers returned to these texts, confident of finding a high order of meaning in them, as great writers have done for centuries after the canon was closed. This is far too extraordinary a phenomenon to be left to cynical use or to neglect.

—Marilynne Robinson
