“Hear my soul speak. The very instant that I saw you, did my heart fly to your service.”

—William Shakespeare, The Tempest

Handmade Porcelain Heart Dish

You may have a heart “most constant” (William Shakespeare), a “crooked” heart (W. H. Auden), a “recalcitrant” heart (Leonora Speyer), a heart “fevered” and “yearning” (George Marion McClellan), a “faithful” heart (Jong Mong-Ju), or even a “tell-tale heart” (Edgar Allan Poe). But you don’t have to be a poet to appreciate the simple beauty and craftsmanship of this handmade porcelain dish.

Made in France from heirloom-quality porcelain, and designed for everyday use, these café au lait bowls, in the distinctive classic shape, are decorated with typography from vintage brasserie menus. We’ve paired them with a Thé pitcher—a classic design that originated in Mehun-sur-Yevre, France. These milk “jugs” are not only used to serve warm milk for café au lait but for juices, sauces, and any other pouring liquids.

Edward Gorey’s signature is on the back of the pin.

For the Romantic [https://shop.nybooks.com/collections/for-the-romantic]                     Reader, I Married Him Silver Brontë Bracelet

“Reader, I married him.”

—Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre

This declarative and witty quotation from Brontë’s masterpiece, one of the most famous stories of romance in all of literature, is stamped inside this artisan-made silver bracelet. From its outer appearance, this looks like an elegant silver cuff; printed inside is an intimate declaration of commitment.

Jewelry [https://shop.nybooks.com/collections/jewelry]

Monet Tulips Silk Chiffon Scarf

The design of this beautiful silk chiffon scarf is inspired by the 1885 painting A Vase of Tulips by French impressionist Claude Monet. While Monet is perhaps best known for painting en plain air (outdoors), he also painted simple still lifes. These works often depict lush, blooming arrangements with a characteristic style that is focused more on the overall atmosphere and sensory experience rather than precise details.

To Wear [https://shop.nybooks.com/collections/jewelry-and-clothing]                     Instead of a Card: Fourteen Poems about Kissing

“Fourteen Poems about Kissing” is a title in the “Instead of a Card” series, based on the idea that sending a greeting card is a lovely gesture, and sending a booklet of poetry an even more meaningful one. Most of us can remember our first kiss, whether it was glorious and transporting or merely awkward. Kissing, it transpires, can happen anywhere—on a train, in a city park or against a kitchen fridge.

Edward Gorey Dancing Cats: 300-Piece Puzzle

We suspect this is what cats get up to when they’re left home alone. These felines—who can be found knitting, skating, balancing, and juggling their way through Edward Gorey’s book Dancing Cats and Neglected Murderesses—fit right in with the rest of his anthropomorphic animals and Edwardian eccentrics. Prolific artist and author Edward St. John Gorey published more than one hundred works, designed sets and costumes for the stage, and had a profound affection for ballet, literature, film, and animals.

Several lines from Shakespeare’s Sonnet 116 are engraved on this sterling silver möbius bracelet: “Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments. Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove. O no! It is an ever-fixed mark, that looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wand’ring bark, whose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken.”

Shakespeare [https://shop.nybooks.com/collections/shakespeare]                         Monet Water Lilies

Silk Chiffon Scarf

The design of this scarf is based on the Nymphéas (”Water Lilies”) paintings made by Claude Monet of the pond at his home in Normandy. In 1924, he wrote, “It took me a long time to understand my water lilies… I grew them without thinking of painting them… And then, all of a sudden, I had the revelation of the enchantment of my pond. I took up my palette.”

For the Home [https://shop.nybooks.com/collections/home-and-desk]                         Perfection NYRB Baseball Cap

Perfection: A virtue to strive for? An ideal to attain? An adjective that reminds you of something special? Or the title of the much-acclaimed NYRB book by Vincenzo Latronico—a scathing novel about contemporary existence, of two people gradually waking up to find themselves in various traps, wondering how it all came to be. Proclaim your love of the book, the goal, the quality, or any other meaning with our handsome black baseball cap embroidered with the stirring word in pale pink.

To Wear [https://shop.nybooks.com/collections/jewelry-and-clothing]                     Fatale NYRB Baseball Cap

For the passionnés de romans noirs, or a perfect gift for the nihilistic Francophile in your life... this cap features a deadly word, in an equally drop-dead hot pink font. Perhaps donning this word will strike passersby with interest or spark the same thrill and madness as the novel of the same name. By famed crime novelist Jean-Patrick Manchette, Fatale follows Aimée, an assassin and master manipulator who falls prey to a pure and wayward passion. Your wardrobe could use something just as “cool, compact, and shockingly original” (The New York Times).

Classic Kaweco Sport Fountain Pen

We first read about this superb writing instrument in a Jon Robin Baitz New York Times interview, who said of the pen, “I thought it was a perfect little thing... I love its precision, its modesty, its clarity and its minimal fuss. This is the cheaper, more practical version of a Mercedes.” The esteemed Kaweco pens epitomize two essential features of a fine writing instrument: classic good looks and a beautifully smooth “write.” Yet there are many other reasons this model has been consistently lauded since its debut in 1933: more than nine decades later, it remains modern in design and sensibility, and efficient in function.
