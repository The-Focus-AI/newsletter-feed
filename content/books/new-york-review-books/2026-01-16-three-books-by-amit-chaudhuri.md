For three days only, all books by Amit Chaudhuri are available at 25% off.                    INCOMPLETENESS [https://www.nyrb.com/products/incompleteness] NEW AND SELECTED ESSAYS, 1999–2023 [https://www.nyrb.com/products/incompleteness]Amit Chaudhuri

A remarkable prose stylist and keen innovator of literary form, Amit Chaudhuri is one of the most singular voices in contemporary letters whose essays, like his fiction, defy categorization and display a sensibility uniquely his own. Incompleteness gathers some of Chaudhuri’s best essays and criticism from more than two decades. In these pieces, Chaudhuri turns his mind to everything from Rabindranath Tagore and Joni Mitchell to the troubles with Indian modernity and globalization’s appropriation of narrative storytelling over poetic incompleteness.

“This collection spanning 25 years includes a remarkable variety of subjects and is written in a variety of styles, from the personal to the academic . . . Chaudhuri is skeptical, alert, often trenchant, allergic to cant but occasionally taken with jargon in this lucid, surprising, and illuminating collection.”

—Michael Autrey, Booklist

Introduction by Pankaj Mishra

Shyamji is the scion of a celebrated Rajasthani dynasty of singers—his father, an Indian classical musician, became renowned as the "heavenly singer"—but his own sights are set on a level of material well-being his father could not achieve. In 1980s Bombay, the business capital of India, he scrapes by as a music teacher to the rich. Among his students are Mallika, the wife of a corporate executive, and her son, Nirmalya, who will embrace the cause of Indian classical music, threatened by the modern world of money, with the fanatical devotion only a sixteen-year-old can muster. Comic and lyrical, the novel is at once a Bombay novel, a story of growing up, a picture of a milieu, and a resonant tribute to the most mysterious and universal of the arts.

“Chaudhuri's characters evolve in subtle ways, through startling insights and observations.... Seldom has any contemporary author invested such detail in descriptions of place, behavior, and physicality. Chaudhuri is astonishingly precise.” —San Francisco Chronicle

Introduction by Edwin Frank

Jayojit, born and bred in India, is a professor of economics at a college in the American Midwest. His ex-wife has moved to California, taking their young son, Bonny, with her. For summer vacation, Jayojit has brought Bonny to Calcutta to visit his mother and father, a retired admiral in the Indian navy. The heat of summer has moved in when the two arrive; the monsoon will come before they leave. During the course of this stay, Jayojit will brood over the past and try to imagine the future, while enduring the inconveniences and misunderstandings and absurdities of family life and occasionally venturing out, alone or with Bonny, to explore the changing landscape of the city.

“Unbelievably beautiful; I like to dip in and out, a few pages at a time, letting the words nurture me.” —Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie
