—Virginia Woolf

Reading Woman Notecard Set

Is there any greater pleasure than sitting comfortably with a good book? The reading woman has appeared as a subject of great art for centuries around the world. This beguiling set of notecards features four captivating images of women reading: Reading, by Alberto Pisa; Alice in Wonderland, by George Dunlop Leslie; A Russian Folk Tale, by Leonid and Olga Tikhomirov; and Woman Reclining on a Bench, by Carl Olof Larsson.

Shop [https://shop.nybooks.com/collections/the-readers-catalog]                      Silence Please Mug

A polite exhortation, “silence please,” appears beneath the English Gothic arch at the entrance to the Bodleian Old Library. Another appears in the library’s fifteenth-century courtyard. In fact, these signs are presented at every entrance to the Bodleian, one of Europe’s oldest libraries and the main research library at the University of Oxford. A reminder of the sanctity of scholarship and the quiet passion of booklovers, this bone china mug is an ode to one of the world’s most famous temples of literature. This mug makes the perfect desk accessory for the Anglophile or gift for those seeking to bring home the tranquility of an Oxford library. Made in Staffordshire exclusively for the Bodleian Libraries.

Instead of a Card:

Ten Poems of Hope

“Ten Poems about Hope” is a title in the “Instead of a Card” series, based on the idea that sending a greeting card is a lovely gesture, and sending a booklet of poetry an even more meaningful one. We couldn’t survive without hope—that light at the end of the tunnel which seems to promise “this will pass” when times are hard. These poems offer hope in a whole range of guises—from the uplift of the first signs of spring to the infectious optimism of a child who believes he will live forever if he eats his greens.

“We have tomorrow

Bright before us

Like a flame”

—Langston Hughes, “Youth”

These words from the poet Langston Hughes are stamped on three slender pendants on this delicate yet modern necklace. This necklace was commissioned by and made exclusively for The Reader’s Catalog.

For the Idealist [https://shop.nybooks.com/collections/for-the-activist]                     Read Banned Books Enamel Pin

“Remember, the firemen are rarely necessary. The public itself stopped reading of its own accord.”

—Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451

The best way to protest the banning of books is to read them. Spread the word by pinning a “Read Banned Books” pin to a lapel, backpack, or bookbag.

“yes I said yes I will Yes” is the memorable closing line of James Joyce’s Ulysses. Spoken by Molly Bloom, it concludes her soliloquy with a powerful affirmation of life and resolve to embrace it. We’ve put this quote on the inside of one of our sterling silver cuffs as a little “secret” message (or a reminder to oneself). Every bracelet is individually made by an artist in the New York City area. Each letter is stamped, then the silver is oxidized, hand-sanded, and polished.

by Glen Baxter

Over four decades and a multitude of books, “Colonel” Glen Baxter has built a world and a language all his own—slightly familiar, decidedly abnormal, irresistibly funny. Baxter’s drawings are a delicious stew of adventure novels, highbrow hijinks, and outright absurdity.
