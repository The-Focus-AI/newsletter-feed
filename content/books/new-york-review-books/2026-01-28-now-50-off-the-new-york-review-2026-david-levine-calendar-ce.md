Greet the new year in style                   with the New York Review of Books David Levine 2026 Calendar

NOW 50% OFF

The 2026 edition of this annual favorite features David Levine classics drawn exclusively for The New York Review of Books. In celebration of free speech, this year’s calendar highlights authors of banned books and their censored works, including F. Scott Fitzgerald and The Great Gatsby, Toni Morrison and The Bluest Eye and Beloved, Isabel Allende and The House of the Spirits, Aldous Huxley and Brave New World, Alice Walker and The Color Purple, and more.

For over forty years, David Levine’s brilliant drawings illustrated and illuminated New York Review articles. John Updike, who was one of the artist’s frequent subjects, paid tribute to Levine: “In a confusing time, he bears witness. In a shoddy time, he does good work. Here he is.”

We’ve returned to our previous 12.5" x 9.5" wall format with large date blocks. This attractive layout makes the calendar ideal for recording notes and appointments.

“‘There’s something about her clothes that feels effortless and sophisticated, like what I imagine a gallery owner in the late ’80s would wear,’ a friend of mine who’s a book editor said…You could easily substitute theater director or architect for gallery owner in that sentence. (For that matter, you could also substitute book editor.)”—Harper’s Bazaar.
