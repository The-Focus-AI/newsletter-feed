—Franklin D. Roosevelt, in a letter to publisher Herbert Putnam

Libraries Save Democracy Tote Bag

Show your support for public libraries and the essential role they play in a democracy by wearing this handsome, well-made tote. Buy one for yourself and consider buying another for a librarian at your local library or your child’s school.
