Alan Alexander Milne was born 144 years ago today. In the Review’s September 20, 1990, issue,  Janet Adam Smith wrote about Milne [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1990/09/27/poohdom/], his halcyon childhood, his mathematical acumen, his work for Granta and Punch, his stifled literary ambitions, and, naturally, his most famous creations—Pooh, Eeyore, Christopher Robin the character, and Christopher Robin Milne the son.

Janet Adam Smith

Poohdom [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1990/09/27/poohdom/]

“The world of the Pooh stories is wild and anarchic—though never violent and never really dangerous. There are no fixed routines, no nursery rules. Pooh gets up when he feels like it, eats whenever he fancies a little something, and enjoys Doing Nothing and also—when he feels like it—adventuring in search of the North Pole, without any grownup to say Don’t, or Take Care, or Be Back by Teatime. And it all has to come to an end when Christopher Robin disappears into the disciplined, time-tabled world of school.”

Trump’s War [https://www.nybooks.com/online/2026/01/03/trumps-war-venezuela/]

The invasion of Venezuela is not law enforcement; it is imperialism, pure and simple.

Satie’s Spell [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2026/01/15/erik-satie-three-piece-suite-penman/]

Erik Satie took down the arrogance of late Romantic classical music, gently but ruthlessly taking up its vocabulary and removing all the excess, including authorship.
