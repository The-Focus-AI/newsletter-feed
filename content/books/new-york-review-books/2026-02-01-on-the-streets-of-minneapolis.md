Robin Kaiser-Schatzlein

Fifteen Below Zero [https://www.nybooks.com/online/2026/01/30/fifteen-below-zero-resisting-the-minneapolis-surge/]

Up against the delirious scale of Operation Metro Surge, ordinary people juggle daily life with looking out for each other however they can.

Cyrus Naji [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2026/02/12/bangladeshs-stalled-student-revolution-cyrus-naji/]

Bangladesh’s Stalled Student Revolution [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2026/02/12/bangladeshs-stalled-student-revolution-cyrus-naji/]

The young radicals who ousted the country’s authoritarian prime minister have so far failed to implement the democratic reforms they promised. Will elections in February correct their course?

Vanessa Ogle [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2026/02/12/rolling-with-the-economic-tides-empty-vessel-kumekawa/]

Rolling with the Economic Tides [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2026/02/12/rolling-with-the-economic-tides-empty-vessel-kumekawa/]

Ian Kumekawa’s Empty Vessel follows the lifespan of one barge, from bunkhouse to floating prison to barracks and back, as it traces the shadowy outer limits of the maritime economy.

Nell Irvin Painter

My Elsewheres [https://www.nybooks.com/online/2026/02/01/my-elsewheres-nell-irvin-painter/]

A lifetime of travel outside the United States has enlarged my sense of history far beyond the prevailing American ideology of race.

Nathan Shields

Liberalism’s Pianist [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2026/02/12/liberalisms-pianist-house-concert-igor-levit/]

Can Igor Levit restore classical music’s claim to cultural and political authority, or is it irrevocably lost?

a poem by

Kathleen Ossip [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2026/02/12/childhood-kathleen-ossip/]

I did die.

Dying was a venetian blind, all parts working together but not in the same direction.

Like a succulent, an aloe leaf—break it and it heals.

I died like boxes in a storage locker—

no hurry to open… [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2026/02/12/childhood-kathleen-ossip/]

In the Review’s November 18, 1971, issue—five months after The New York Times began publishing excerpts from the Pentagon Papers— Hannah Arendt wrote a reflection on some of the lessons to be gleaned [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1971/11/18/lying-in-politics-reflections-on-the-pentagon-pape/] from the revelations in the Department of Defense’s reports about the Vietnam War. Specifically, she was interested in “the basic issue raised by the Papers”: deception. “Whoever reflects on these matters,” Arendt mused, “can only be surprised how little attention has been paid, in our tradition of philosophical and political thought, to their significance, on the one hand, for the nature of action and, on the other, for the nature of our ability to deny in thought and word whatever happens to be the actual fact.”

Hannah Arendt

Lying in Politics: Reflections on the Pentagon Papers [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1971/11/18/lying-in-politics-reflections-on-the-pentagon-pape/]

“The quicksand of lying statements of all sorts, deceptions as well as self-deceptions, is apt to engulf any reader who wishes to probe this material, which, unhappily, he must recognize as the infrastructure of nearly a decade of United States foreign and domestic policy.”

Trump’s Attack on Philanthropy [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2026/02/12/trumps-attack-on-philanthropy-neier-lamarche/]

“The Trump administration has not been shy about threatening to revoke the tax-exempt status of foundations and nonprofits that criticize or oppose it.… A tax measure designed to promote philanthropic freedom can also be a cudgel for control.”

Jérôme Tubiana

Darfur’s Endless War [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2026/02/12/darfurs-endless-war-el-fasher-tubiana/]

“On October 29 a drone flew over Um Baru for five hours and launched six bombs, killing two and injuring five, mostly civilians. I joined many of the villagers in fleeing to the woods near the village, where we hid under what trees we could find.”
