A sweeping true-crime book about frauds, gangsters, oligarchs, and blood money;
a singular, fourth wall-breaking conspiracy drama about New Age healing, grief, and memory;
four tracks I’ve been listening to a lot lately.

Now, the roundup:
Sweeping true crime
London Falling  by Patrick Radden Keefe 
It feels a bit like cheating to recommend a Patrick Radden Keefe book, because it’s not exactly going to fly under the radar. But his latest, London Falling, which comes out in April, is fascinating, and I think of particular interest to Read Max readers. The book expands an earlier New Yorker story about Zac Brettler, an English teenager who secretly passed himself off as the son of Kazakh oligarchs before dying mysteriously in a fall from an ultraluxe apartment balcony, and the two men who last saw him: Verinder Sharma, a shady gangster, and Akbar Shamji, a gadabout entrepreneur. But beyond the central, gripping mystery, this is a recent history of London--from the gangsters of the 70s and 80s to the oligarchs and tax cheats of the 21st century--and its place as a central node in the global web of money and politics. 
What else I’m reading
Phil Neel on Minneapolis :
The frozen city is under siege. In the long cold winters at the heart of the Midwest the air can get so cold it hurts to breathe. Masked mercenaries in unmarked vehicles rove through the snowbanks, snatching people off the street and shuttling them to detention centers for indefinite periods of time. Each of the mercenaries is paid tens of thousands in a “signing bonus” (up to 50k, and 60k in student loan forgiveness) simply to take up arms on behalf of the embattled regime. Faced with a slow-motion economic crisis in which a surreal, state-backed stock market boom is paired with persistent stagflation in the everyday economy, bootlicking is one of the few industries seeing any real growth. As the streets freeze in Minneapolis, the S&P reaches record highs. Meanwhile, the last year’s employment growth was so dismal that, after the numbers were released, the regime moved quickly to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and threaten media outlets reporting on the figures. In addition to declining employment due to the freeze on immigration, the depth of the crisis is signaled by the ongoing drop in the Labor Force Participation Rate, which served as the largest single drag on employment growth in the first half of 2025 — indicating that more and more people are dropping out of the labor force entirely, but not being picked up by unemployment statistics. We can therefore think of the siege as sort of mercenary Keynesianism, making up for the lack of employment in the new AI-powered defense sectors that have been the focus of the larger plunder-and-restructure approach to governance.
Deployed from distant cities, they handcuff detainees then beat them when they can’t fight back. They fire non-lethal rounds with intent to maim. They have repeatedly run people over with vehicles. Individuals simply driving home from work have their windows smashed and are dragged from their vehicles to be beaten and detained for hours, sometimes days. Now they are shooting people with live ammunition. They raided a middle school parking lot. They pulled a mother out of her car and put her in an unmarked van and drove off, leaving her infant in a carseat with the door open in sub-zero temperatures (luckily rescued by those in the crowd). They teargassed and threw flashbangs at a car full of children, hospitalizing them all, including a six-month-old baby unable to breathe. In reprisal for community response, they’ve begun raiding the houses of citizens as well, often getting the addresses wrong. The mayor says there is nothing to be done. The governor has summoned the national guard — to be deployed not against the mercenaries, of course, but against those protesting them. The nation’s judicial authorities not only refuse to prosecute but have, instead, been commanded to investigate the victims and their family members. Every night, everyone in the world watches videos of bodies draped in shadow, moving in the icy dark of the city under siege. On the livestreams, people scream and cry, the mercenaries hurl their threats, fire their weapons, and, faced with a big enough crowd, they retreat. The hotels that host them are trashed. The cars they abandon are ransacked. In response, more troops are sent by the president, a mad king in a rotting body yelling incoherent mandates from his palace in the swamp. The sun rises and we wake with the bitter taste of fresh atrocities awaiting.
Beth Mathews on why control rooms are seafoam green :
Keeping in theme with “control rooms”, I researched the second Manhattan Project plant, the Hanford Site, home to the B Reactor, the first full-scale plutonium production reactor in the world. To my surprise, this site looked like an ode to Birren’s light green and color codes, which makes sense, since his client, DuPont, was also responsible for the design and construction of Hanford.
In Birren’s 1963 book Color for Interiors: Historical and Modern , he writes about research undertaken to measure eye fatigue in the industrial workplace and the effects of interior color on human efficiency and well-being. Using the color chart above, he states that the proper use of color hues can reduce accidents, raise standards of machine maintenance, and improve labor morale.
“The importance of color in factories is first to control brightness in the general field of view for an efficient seeing condition. Interiors can then be conditioned for emotional pleasure and interest, using warm, cool, or luminois hues as working conditions suggest. Color should be functional and not merely decorative.” - Faber Birren
A weird, haunting new-age conspiracy theory
Invention (2024) dir. Courtney Stephens 
Streaming on Mubi
I didn’t know much about Invention before I watched it, and in some ways that’s better--if you trust me, just trust me, and check it out. But I say that also because it’s quite a hard movie to describe: Carrie Fernandez inherits from her recently deceased New-Age health entrepreneur father, “Dr. J,” the patent to a vibrational healing device. As she processes her semi-estranged dad’s death, she meets up with his (strange) old colleagues and business partners and begins to wonder if his death was not, actually an accident. But that plot description only gets you so far: The actress playing Carrie, Callie Hernandez--who’s absolutely excellent--is in fact the daughter of a deceased New-Age health entrepreneur, and film is interwoven with real archival footage of Carrie/Callie’s father, as well as fourth wall-breaking interludes featuring recordings from the set. The overall effect is eerie and dreamlike (helped along by gorgeous 16mm photography and great, off-kilter supporting performances from Caveh Zahedi as a tech investor and Joe Swanberg as a Christian manufacturer) and unlike anything else I’ve seen recently. Highly recommended.
