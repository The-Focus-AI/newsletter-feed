Greetings from Read Max HQ! Every other Wednesday at 2 p.m. John Ganz [ https://open.substack.com/users/4290781-john-ganz?utm_source=mentions ] (author of When the Clock Broke and proprietor of the Unpopular Front Substack) and I host a Substack Live chat about politics, tech, culture, and the pieces we’ve been working on.
This week, we were lucky enough to be joined by the great Vinson Cunningham , New Yorker staff writer, host of the “Critics at Large” podcast, and author of the novel Great Expectations, as well as a wonderful Substack called Vinson Cunningham's Quiet Storm . It was a great discussion.
While the chat is free when live, and a short preview is available above only paying subscribers can access the archive of these chats as video and podcast audio! (Paying subscribers can get these conversations as podcasts in their app of choice by following instructions here .)
In this conversation we talked about:
Renee Good’s murder and the Trump administration’s ongoing siege of Minneapolis;
the abduction of Nicolas Maduro and the increasingly bellicosity of the Trump administration;
relatedly, Dexter Filkins’ profile of Marco Rubio ;
Elon Musk and the Grok child porn fiasco.
We also took listener questions.
