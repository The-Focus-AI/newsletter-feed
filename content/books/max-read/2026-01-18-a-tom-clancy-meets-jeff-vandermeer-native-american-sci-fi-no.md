Greetings from Read Max HQ, and welcome to our weekly roundup column, in which I pick out some worthwhile and often overlooked books, articles, movies, and music to recommend to paying subscribers. For this week’s round-up, I’ve got:
A gripping, propulsive, Native cosmic-horror sci-fi novel about first contact that’s a bit Stephen Graham Jones, a bit Tom Clancy, and a bit Jeff VanderMeer;
essays, columns, articles, and newsletters about Trump’s program, journalism, and the 2026 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference;
a cool new comedy-thriller TV show about a psychedelic miracle cure and the conspiracies deployed to suppress it; and
four tracks I’ve been listening to a bunch.
If any of that sounds interesting--and if you want to support Read Max in its continuing mission of explaining the future to relatively normal people--please subscribe below.

Now, the roundup. :
Cosmic-horror first-contact Native sci-fi
Hole in the Sky  by Daniel H. Wilson 
I didn’t read much new sci-fi last year, so I was eager to pick up Daniel H. Wilson’s new book Hole in the Sky--an extremely propulsive first-contact thriller with a timeline so compact one is tempted to describe it as “real time.” Covering four main narrators--a mysterious government figure known as the Man Downstairs, a neurodivergent scientist in the Voyager division at N.A.S.A., a Pentagon weapons expert tracking an uptick in U.A.P. sightings, and a Native guy dealing with family tragedy in the Oklahoma town around which the U.A.P. sightings seem to be gathering--in the hours leading up to, and after, first contact, the book begins as an almost Tom Clancy-ish thriller (Wilson is excellent on the technical details of weapons and vehicles) with some cool flourishes (the Man Downstairs is a former artist tracking predictions made by an algorithm he calls The Pattern) before transforming into VanderMeer-esque cosmic horror, as our characters traverse a suddenly transformed, near-unrecognizable landscape. Wilson, a Cherokee citizen, subtly handles the irony of a first contact novel set among contemporary Native Americans and wields Native mythology deftly. An excellent, fast read. 
What else I’m reading
Abhishaike Mahajan on the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference :
This is my strongest theory so far. That the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference isn’t exactly real or unreal, but a mass-coordination social contract that has been unconsciously signed by everyone in this industry, transcending the need for an underlying referent.
My skeptical readers will protest at this, and they would be correct to do so. The story I have written out is clean, but it cannot be fully correct. Thomas Schelling was not so naive as to believe that Schelling points spontaneously generate out of thin air, there is always a reason, a specific, grounded reason, that their concepts become the low-energy metaphysical basins that they are. Grand Central Station is special because of the cultural gravitas it has accumulated through popular media. Noon is special because that is when the sun reaches its zenith. The Kaaba was worshipped because it was not some arbitrary cube; the cube itself was special, that it contained The Black Stone, set into the eastern corner, a relic that predates Islam itself, that some traditions claim fell from heaven.
And there are signs, if you know where to look, that the underlying referent for the Westin St. Francis status being a gathering area is physical. Consider the heat. It is January in San Francisco, usually brisk, yet the interior of the Westin St. Francis maintains a distinct, humid microclimate. Consider the low-frequency vibration in the lobby that ripples the surface of water glasses, but doesn’t seem to register on local, public seismographs. There is something about the building itself that feels distinctly alien. But, upon standing outside the building for long enough, you’ll have the nagging sensation that it is not something about the hotel that feels off, but rather, what lies within, underneath, and around the hotel.
Nikhil Pal Singh on Trump’s ‘Homeland Empire’ :
Trump’s real innovation has been to marry the archaic geopolitics of a settler empire to the modern legal frameworks devised by his liberal predecessors. What distinguishes his latest regime is its effort to reimagine and remake the borders of American state power, collapsing the foreign and the domestic in a single domain of impunity: call it ‘Homeland Empire’.
The Trump administration envisions “reshoring” national security in a lasting way, drawing on the dubious norms and legalities of the War on Terror and the rancid infrastructures and policing capacities of America’s domestic penal complex. If George W. Bush helped invent the concept of ‘homeland security’ in order to “fight the terrorists over there” rather than here, Trump seeks to bring the war to “OUR hemisphere”. From Caracas to Minneapolis, legal authority and institutional power are being redirected toward an overriding end: governing populations as subjects rather than citizens. […]
But a theory of violence is not a theory of power. Trump’s Homeland Empire is incapable of generating consensual order or lasting hegemony: it can only sustain itself through short-term clearing operations – smash and grab. Maybe this is what happens when the actual, functioning empire enters its terminal, attritional phase: construction, growth and visions of progress are replaced by pyrotechnic convulsions. Rather than banishing the spectres of deindustrialisation, stagnant wages and rising midlife morbidity, it creates new spectacles of deportation and extrajudicial killings, and prospective annexations of oil wealth and ice fields – in order to conjure a world in which dominance affirms its own necessity.
Tommy Craggs on Bari Weiss :
The truth is that prestige journalism is lousy with Bari Weisses, up and down the line. Ask any journalist trying to cover the genocide in Gaza  or the social death of gender nonconformists . Ask any reporter who has spent time in one corner or another of the racism beat. Ask Ismail Ibrahim  or Felicia Sonmez  or Sandhya Dirks . Right this moment, in newsrooms all across the country, there are untold Bari Weisses preaching the doctrines of high journalism while quietly going about the work of making the actual journalism suck. They are softening claims, torturing the prose within an inch of its life, deferring to the cops , abetting a fascist incursion , introducing epistemic uncertainty where there is none , publishing Dylan Byers. If challenged on any of it, they will protest that they are merely upholding a standard, assuming the proud, martyred air of some lone sentry at the parapets of our besieged profession, after which they’ll do a panel with Andrew Schulz or something.
Over here we find one of our many Bari Weisses “attempting to eliminate bias” by sidelining a Black reporter  from covering an antiracist uprising because of a pungently apposite tweet. Over there we see them convening an internal review that will cluck at a story for not adequately establishing that the Trump administration, which twice gained the White House on the promise of overturning the civil rights of some people, is actually “intent on overturning civil rights .” They are the tone worriers, the stet unstetters, the high priests of the “critics say” clause. They are the bosses at the Washington Post who kept Sonmez, a survivor of sexual violence, from covering stories involving sexual assault  because they worried about “the appearance of a conflict of interest.”
The appearance—a brand manager’s concern. And yet, while they may often approach the job as if it were a species of marketing, little the Bari Weisses demand will appear unreasonable or nonjournalistic on its face, because they are also fluent in the idiom of social responsibility. In a different memo , this one to the whole staff, Weiss noted that “the majority of Americans say they do not trust the press” and ruminated over how the audience might be won back.
A great, funny, strange psychedelic conspiracy thriller
Common Side Effects (2025) created by Joe Bennett and Steve Hely 
Streaming on HBO Max
Joe Bennett, who created Scavenger’s Reign, one of the best sci-fi TV shows of the past few years, is back with another excellent animated show, this time co-created with Steve Hely, iconic to me and millions of others as “Jerem” from 30 Rock. Common Side Effects, which concerns a pudgy amateur chemist named Marshall, who uncovers a world-changing mushroom that heals any disease, and his old high school friend Frances, who works for one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, Common Side Effects is (like Scavenger’s Reign) odd and uncategorizable--at once a conspiracy thriller and a psychedelic comedy, with neither tone overwhelming or dominating. The animation is wonderful (in particular the trip sequences) and voice performances are perfect, especially Mike Judge as Frances’ boss--a nice nod to the animator whose Weird Texas Left politics and deadpan humor inform Common Side Effects more than any other predecessor. Genuinely, this of the best new TV shows in a long time.
