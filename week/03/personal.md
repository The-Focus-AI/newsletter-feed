OpenSnow's Dr. Jay Cordeira provided detailed daily snow forecasts for New England skiers throughout the week, tracking a pattern shift from the January thaw to sustained winter conditions. The week began with the return of colder weather and upslope snow showers bringing 3.5 inches to Woodbury, Vermont and 8-10 inches at Jay Peak.

> "Winter returns in New England with several rounds of snow throughout the week. Snow will be mostly light to start the week, but could end with larger storms into the long weekend." — [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42299?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

The forecasts revealed significant uncertainty around potential coastal storms for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42299?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026) noted that model guidance ranged from 3-6 inches on the conservative end to "well over a foot" on the optimistic end, with the ECMWF, GFS, and Canadian Ensemble systems all showing >75% probabilities of more than six inches across northern New England mountains.

By Saturday, snowfall exceeded expectations across central and southwest New England, with >8 inches reported in southern Vermont and the Berkshires. Sunday's forecast focused on a near-coastal storm favoring southern New England, with 3-6 inches expected over eastern Massachusetts.

> "Snow on Saturday ended up coming in a bit stronger than anticipated – well, at least stronger than *I* anticipated. Most of the forcing for the snowfall ended up focused across portions of central and southwest New England where >8 inches of snow was reported in southern Vermont and the Berkshires." — [Dr. Jay Cordeira, OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42407?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

### 2. Season-Long Winter Outlook
**Coverage:** [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html)

[OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html) published a mid-season assessment revealing a stark regional divide in winter 2025-2026 performance: while the Western United States has experienced a "rough" season, the Canadian Rockies and Eastern North America have seen "excellent" conditions. The report drew comparisons to winter 2017-2018 and outlined expectations for the second half of the season.

> "As of mid-January, the winter of 2025-2026 has been a rough one across much of the Western United States. However, it has been an excellent season across the Canadian Rockies and Eastern North America." — [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html)

The analysis noted that the West would remain in a dry pattern until at least January 20, while the East would continue experiencing consistent cold temperatures with multiple snow opportunities through the week ahead. The newsletter also highlighted Japan's exceptional conditions: "Japanuary is on, and the storms are lining up for the next ten days."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Regional New England Focus**: All newsletters in this category served a distinctly New England-centric audience, from Vermont ski conditions to Connecticut public broadcasting to a Warren, CT general store. This suggests the recipient's personal newsletter subscriptions reflect strong geographic ties to the region.

**Weather as Leisure Planning**: [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42299?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)'s detailed forecasting approach treated weather not as news but as critical planning information for recreation, with specific snowfall predictions for individual ski resorts and analysis of "Nor'easter odds" for the holiday weekend.

**Data-Driven Personal Insights**: Both [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42299?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026) and [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) delivered quantitative, data-focused updates—weather models and probabilities in one case, traffic metrics and referrer sources in the other—reflecting a preference for actionable information over narrative content.

**AI Integration in Personal Services**: Multiple newsletters highlighted AI tools. [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42299?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026) announced their PEAKS AI model for mountain forecasting ("up to 50% more accurate in mountain terrain"), while also noting that the "AI version of the ECMWF ensemble is a major buzzkill" compared to dynamical models—suggesting both enthusiasm for AI applications and recognition of their limitations.

**Forecast Transparency**: [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html) demonstrated accountability by publishing forecast verification data, acknowledging they "under-forecasted by 19% against the total snowfall" for their January 7 predictions. Dr. Cordeira also openly admitted when Saturday's snow exceeded his expectations.
