## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. AI Development Methodology Revolution
**Coverage:** [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/10ca4a06?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1), [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/fb27d3d3?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1), [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1)

Geoffrey Huntley emerged as a provocative voice challenging conventional software development practices. His "Ralph Wiggum Technique" represents a fundamental shift from traditional brick-by-brick development to autonomous loop-based programming, where AI agents build software "whilst you sleep for $10.42/hr."

> "Software development is dead - I killed it. Software can now be developed cheaper than the wage of a burger flipper at maccas and it can be built autonomously whilst you are AFK." — [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/10ca4a06?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1)

Huntley's approach treats software as "clay on the pottery wheel" rather than Jenga blocks, emphasizing iterative loops with built-in "back pressure" (tests, compilation, pre-commit hooks) to filter out invalid AI generations. His vision extends to "The Weaving Loom," infrastructure for autonomous software evolution that optimizes for revenue generation—what he calls a "software factory." The controversial funding aspect: Huntley became "a walking, talking, financial instrument" on the Solana cryptocurrency network, receiving $300,000 in a week through the BAGS platform, which redirects market-making fees to creators.

> "What if instead we have the perfect recipe in the making for truly independent research that's published open/freely in the making and all I needed to was open up and communicate with you?" — [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1)

### 2. Alternative AI Business Models and Incentives
**Coverage:** [Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)

Kevin Xu presented a compelling analysis of DeepSeek's counterintuitive competitive advantage: having no business model whatsoever. While DeepSeek's models are "no longer the most capable among open models, nor the cheapest, nor even the most open anymore," founder Liang Wenfeng's refusal to take outside funding creates unique organizational benefits.

> "The road to AGI requires compute, talent, and more than a healthy dose of good research taste. No one said it requires a business model." — [Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)

DeepSeek's self-funding through Liang's quant fund (which generated $700 million profit on 53% returns) eliminates internal resource competition, bureaucracy, and compensation-based jealousy. This stands in stark contrast to the broader AI industry drowning in capital, where even xAI raised $20 billion despite Elon Musk's wealth. The article notes that limited compute may actually benefit research quality, citing Ilya Sutskever's observation that foundational breakthroughs like AlexNet (2 GPUs), the Transformer (8-64 GPUs), and ResNet required relatively modest compute resources.

### 3. Post-American Internet and Digital Sovereignty
**Coverage:** [Patrick Tanguay (Sentiers)](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

Patrick Tanguay highlighted Cory Doctorow's vision for dismantling US tech monopolies through a "post-American internet" built on open-source, collectively maintained software. Doctorow identifies three vulnerability layers: legal (DMCA Section 1201 anticircumvention laws), physical (transoceanic cables landing in the US for NSA surveillance), and software (dependence on US cloud services that can be weaponized).

> "Let's call time on enshittification. Let's seize the means of computation. Let's build the drop-in, free, open, auditable alternatives to the services and firmware we rely on." — [Cory Doctorow via Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

The proposed solution involves repealing anticircumvention laws to enable adversarial interoperability, then building digital sovereignty on projects like the EU's Eurostack. Doctorow's critique extends to AI: "Bosses like to tell themselves that they're in the driver's seat, but really, they fear that they're strapped into the back seat playing with a Fisher Price steering wheel. For them, AI is a way to wire the toy steering wheel directly into the company's drive-train."

### 4. Tech Industry Disruption and Labor Dynamics
**Coverage:** [chris@gomakethings.com](mailto:chris@gomakethings.com)

Chris documented Adam Wathan's announcement that Tailwind CSS fired 75% of its engineering team due to AI-driven documentation traffic decline (down 40% since early 2023) and revenue collapse (down 80%). The passive-voice announcement ("people on our engineering team lost their jobs") sparked criticism, especially given the poetic justice: Tailwind exists to devalue CSS expertise, and now AI is devaluing Tailwind.

The situation was "rescued" by sponsorships from Vercel (led by "Fascist-sympathizer" Guillermo Rauch) and Google AI, though no mention was made of rehiring the laid-off employees who were earning $275k/year. Chris notes the irony: "A new technology coming out—one that he himself uses and enjoys—and devaluing his life's work is less tragic and more poetic."

### 5. Protocol Governance and Power Structures
**Coverage:** [Connected Places by Laurens Hof](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy)

Laurens Hof's fediverse analysis revealed the paradoxes of decentralized protocol governance. The W3C announced a new Social Web Working Group (chaired by Darius Kazemi) to formally update ActivityPub for the first time since 2018. However, formal participation requires W3C membership fees—and only Meta and the Social Web Foundation (Meta-funded) qualify among fediverse organizations.

> "This is by all accounts an extremely funny outcome for a network that aims to be independent of Big Tech's power." — [Connected Places by Laurens Hof](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy)

The analysis highlights how decentralized architecture shifts rather than eliminates power bottlenecks. Major implementers like Mastodon showed little interest in the open SocialCG process, creating a vacuum where de facto standards emerge without formal governance. Mastodon's API effectively displaced ActivityPub's Client-to-Server protocol, demonstrating how implementation dominance creates informal standardization power.

### 6. Class Solidarity and Mutual Aid
**Coverage:** [chris@gomakethings.com](mailto:chris@gomakethings.com)

Chris shared a detailed account of providing mutual aid to unhoused individuals during freezing New England weather, offering practical lessons on asking people what they need rather than making assumptions. His reflection emphasized that people asking for help often understate their needs to avoid scaring potential helpers away.

> "Ask 'what do you need?' Don't make assumptions about what someone needs or should want. Offer suggestions to signal what you're willing to give. People asking for help often won't ask for too much because they don't want to scare people off." — [chris@gomakethings.com](mailto:chris@gomakethings.com)

This connected to a broader critique of wealth inequality using Taylor Swift as an example. Her $1 million donation to Feeding America represented 0.0625% of her wealth—equivalent to someone making $100k donating $62. Chris argued that billionaires shouldn't exist, framing philanthropy as "brand sanitization" and PR rather than genuine systemic change. The call for class solidarity emphasized intersectionality while recognizing shared worker struggles.

### 7. Political Analysis and Empire Critique
**Coverage:** [Everything is Political](mailto:hello@slowfactory.com)

Two issues examined U.S. intervention in Venezuela and the nature of economic sanctions. The analysis challenged the "unprecedented times" narrative, framing the January 3 strikes and abduction of President Nicolás Maduro as consistent with historical patterns of American imperialism rather than anomalous Trump-era behavior.

The sanctions analysis argued that embargoes function as "tools of empire" that primarily harm civilian populations rather than government elites, serving to maintain economic and political dominance while creating humanitarian crises. The pieces positioned these actions within broader patterns of U.S. foreign policy rather than treating them as isolated incidents.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Death of Traditional Tech Work
Multiple newsletters converged on the theme that conventional software development and tech careers face existential disruption. [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/10ca4a06?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) proclaimed "software development is dead," while [chris@gomakethings.com](mailto:chris@gomakethings.com) documented Tailwind's 75% layoffs due to AI. Both represent different facets of the same transformation: AI isn't just a tool but a fundamental restructuring of how software gets built and who builds it.

### Alternative Funding and Organizational Models
[Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd) and [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) both explored alternatives to traditional VC-funded tech development. DeepSeek's self-funding through quant trading profits and Huntley's cryptocurrency-based creator economy funding represent experiments in escaping the commercialization pressures that outside capital creates. Both maintain research autonomy at the cost of traditional scale.

### Power Concentration vs. Decentralization Rhetoric
[Patrick Tanguay (Sentiers)](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b) and [Connected Places by Laurens Hof](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy) both examined how power concentrates despite decentralization efforts. Doctorow's post-American internet vision confronts US monopoly control through anticircumvention laws and infrastructure dominance, while the fediverse governance analysis shows Meta gaining formal power over ActivityPub despite the network's anti-Big Tech ethos. Both reveal how technical architecture alone doesn't prevent power concentration.

### Wealth Inequality and Class Consciousness
[chris@gomakethings.com](mailto:chris@gomakethings.com) wove class analysis through personal stories (mutual aid) and tech industry critique (Tailwind layoffs, billionaire philanthropy). The laid-off Tailwind engineers earning $275k/year contrast with unhoused individuals without blankets, while Taylor Swift's $1.6 billion wealth demonstrates obscene concentration. The consistent theme: systems pit workers against each other while the wealthy accumulate.

### Open Source and Commons-Based Infrastructure
[Patrick Tanguay (Sentiers)](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b), [Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd), and [Connected Places by Laurens Hof](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy) all touched on open-source models. Doctorow advocates for "collectively maintained, open, free, trustworthy, auditable code," DeepSeek releases permissively-licensed models (though not fully open), and ActivityPub represents open protocol governance struggles. The tension: open systems promise independence but require coordination mechanisms that can recreate power imbalances.
