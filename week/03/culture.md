## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. The Battle Over Children and Social Media
**Coverage:** [Jon Haidt from After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16), [Jon Haidt from After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/mountains-of-evidence)

Jon Haidt devoted two substantial essays to arguing that social media poses an unacceptable risk to children and adolescents. His first piece made a developmental case for setting the minimum age at 16 rather than 15, emphasizing that most teens are still in the crucial brain-sculpting period of puberty at 15.

> "The average adolescent in the U.S. now spends around five hours a day using social media. Their brains will enhance whichever neurons and circuits are activated repeatedly, at the expense of neurons and circuits that are underused." — [Jon Haidt from After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16)

He argued against parental consent exceptions, noting they trap families in a collective action problem where every child pleads "but everyone else's parents gave them permission." Haidt recommended four key features for age-limit policies: setting the minimum at 16 or higher, no parental consent exceptions, focusing on account creation rather than content access, and defining social media by harmful design features rather than specific platforms.

His second essay presented what he called "mountains of evidence" that social media is unsafe for young people. Drawing on academic research and Meta's own leaked internal studies, Haidt distinguished between the "historical trends question" (did social media cause the 2010s mental health crisis?) and the "product safety question" (is social media safe today?). He argued the latter can be answered definitively: no.

> "Countries around the world ran a giant uncontrolled experiment on their own children in the 2010s by giving them smartphones and social media accounts at young ages. The evidence is in: the experiment has harmed them. It is time to call it off." — [Jon Haidt from After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/mountains-of-evidence)

Meta's own Project Mercury experiment from 2019 found that users who deactivated Facebook and Instagram for a month reported "lower feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and social comparison." One Meta researcher stated that "the Nielsen study does show causal impact on social comparison."

### 2. AI and the Future of Software Development
**Coverage:** [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/all-gas-town-no-brakes-town)

Rusty Foster delivered a comprehensive dive into "Gas Town," a project that imagines replacing an entire software development company with AI agents. The system, created by veteran engineer Steve Yegge, uses multiple AI "workers" with roles like "the Mayor," "the Deacon," and "the Dogs" to orchestrate code generation at scale.

The reality, however, is revealing: the system includes a daemon that pings agents every few minutes saying "Do your job" because the AIs keep forgetting what they're supposed to be doing. There's also a special upper-level Dog whose job is to remind the Deacon to do its job, which is to remind all the other workers to do their jobs.

> "Gas Town is a chaotic conceptual mess that probably doesn't work very well, but at least it has pizzazz." — [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/all-gas-town-no-brakes-town)

Foster highlighted a crucial paradox: while AI can generate code, the people successfully using these tools are experts like Steve Yegge, Paul Ford, and Casey Newton—developers with decades of experience who know "deep in their bones how to describe the way a computer program should be structured." Paul Ford reported his semi-working synthesizer app "has taken 1,000 turns to get to this state. How many turns remain? Another thousand? Twenty times that? I don't know."

The question remains: Will junior developers ever gain that understanding if they spend their careers instructing AI rather than writing code? And will AI ever gain a high-level conceptual understanding of software architecture when it isn't currently capable of understanding how to run a vending machine?

Foster positioned himself as "an AI hater," quoting Anthony Moser's pointed critique:

> "The makers of AI aren't damned by their failures, they're damned by their goals. They want to build a genie to grant them wishes, and their wish is that nobody ever has to make art again. They want to create a new kind of mind, so they can force it into mindless servitude." — [Anthony Moser, via Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/all-gas-town-no-brakes-town)

### 3. The Crisis of Online Addiction and Platform Accountability
**Coverage:** [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/4712d231?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

Ian Williams delivered a searing indictment of Twitter's AI-generated child porn problem and the media's refusal to leave the platform. What disturbed Williams most wasn't just the child porn itself, but "the point-blank refusal of the media and political classes to give Twitter up, delivered in contradictory, murky, and often false statements made by way of excusing themselves."

Williams traced how excuses evolved: first Grok was treated as sentient when convenient, then not sentient when that excuse failed. When the "people, not machines, are bad" argument stopped working, the paywall became the excuse—until that too was revealed as ineffective.

> "The connective tissue here is simply that the people who run the world cannot, will not, get off Twitter." — [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/4712d231?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

Williams connected this addiction to broader patterns of online-induced psychosis and destruction: "There's something dark, primordial, destructive about the online addiction that is driving so many of us to madness." Drawing on Klaus Theweleit's *Male Fantasies*, Williams suggested we may be witnessing something ancient and disturbing:

> "We are, perhaps only aspirationally but still meaningfully, little Agamemnons underneath the thin cloth of civilization we all wear. Recognizable but not. Primeval. Destructive without direction for any number of reasons." — [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/4712d231?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

His conclusion was blunt: "If you're still on Twitter, you're a mark and an asshole who evidently approves of child porn, that is, who doesn't disapprove of it enough to exit the child porn factory."

### 4. Rethinking the Digital Body
**Coverage:** [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email)

Anne Helen Petersen interviewed Vanessa Chang about her book *The Body Digital*, which explores how technologies from the camera obscura to smartphones have shaped human embodiment. Chang argued that "the digital body is not an abstraction—it is us, becoming, again and again, in the technologies we build and the worlds we inhabit."

The interview traced fascinating histories of co-evolution between technology and our senses. The Ear chapter explored how listening evolved from communal choir experiences (where "breath leaves a body as sound, which enters another as vibration") to algorithmic curation on Spotify, where "digital ears inhabit systems built on, and masquerading as, longstanding organic communities."

> "Where mixtapes revealed how much someone knew and loved you, Spotify's algorithmic curator can't know you—it's only sifting your data." — [Vanessa Chang, via Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email)

The Foot chapter explored walking and urban infrastructure, tracing how "paths become roads, and roads become highways—technologies we rarely recognize as such, but which, like all technologies, shape how bodies move, gather, and belong."

Chang emphasized that digital tools aren't inherently less embodied—they could be more grounded in our bodies if designed that way. But "because so much technological production is consolidated within major tech companies, these tools are often designed to commandeer our attention, calibrate our desires, and harvest our data."

On AI, Chang pushed for a conversation that moves beyond "hate/hype binary," highlighting projects like a Māori community in New Zealand training natural-language processing to revitalize their language—with data sovereignty and community governance built in from the start.

> "If we want AI to reflect human values, we need to build the conditions under which more humans get to define what those values are." — [Vanessa Chang, via Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email)

The interview concluded with a crucial point: data surveillance and extraction aren't problems individuals can solve by setting better boundaries or being more creative. "These are collective, infrastructural problems, not individual ones."

### 5. Dystopian Internet Futures and Digital Sovereignty
**Coverage:** [Patrick Tanguay (Sentiers)](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

Patrick Tanguay's newsletter featured Cory Doctorow's vision for a "post-American internet"—one that breaks free from US legal infrastructure (DMCA anticircumvention laws), physical infrastructure (NSA-tapped undersea cables), and software infrastructure (US cloud services that can be weaponized).

Doctorow identified three major vulnerabilities in the current US-dominated architecture. Legal: anticircumvention laws like DMCA Section 1201, which the US Trade Representative forced on the world through trade agreements, making it illegal to jailbreak devices or build interoperable alternatives without manufacturer permission. Physical: most transoceanic fiber optic cables make landfall in the US, where the NSA has been tapping them since at least 2006. Software: the world's governments and businesses locked into US cloud services that can be weaponized or remotely disabled.

> "The US trade representative has forced every one of its trading partners to adopt anticircumvention law, to facilitate the extraction of their own people's data and money by American firms." — [Patrick Tanguay (Sentiers)](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

Doctorow's solution involves repealing anticircumvention laws and building digital sovereignty on open-source, commons-based software like the EU's Eurostack project, which can be collectively maintained, audited, and localized by institutions worldwide. The door is "open a crack," he argues, and the first country to walk through it becomes the "disenshittification nation" supplying freedom-enhancing tools to the rest of the world.

On AI and labor, Doctorow offered a biting observation:

> "Bosses like to tell themselves that they're in the driver's seat, but really, they fear that they're strapped into the back seat playing with a Fisher Price steering wheel. For them, AI is a way to wire the toy steering wheel directly into the company's drive-train. It's the realization of the fantasy of a company without workers." — [Patrick Tanguay (Sentiers)](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

The newsletter also highlighted Bryan Alexander's analysis of "polycrisis"—how multiple overlapping crises (demographic shifts, climate change, geopolitical tensions, technological developments) interact and exacerbate one another, with national elites increasingly struggling to maintain control amid these compounded pressures.

### 6. Self-Knowledge Systems and Digital Meaning-Making
**Coverage:** [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/what-have-self-148137146?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148137146&utm_id=40e538e6-fdc8-420d-bbff-cb47d3ec0289&utm_medium=email)

[Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/what-have-self-148137146?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148137146&utm_id=40e538e6-fdc8-420d-bbff-cb47d3ec0289&utm_medium=email) initiated a discussion about "self-knowledge systems" like the Enneagram, tarot, and astrology, asking readers to share what valuable insights they've opened and what's "sticky" in these tools. This reflected a broader cultural tension between quantified self-tracking (Fitbits, step counters) and more interpretive, meaning-making systems that resist algorithmic reduction.

### 7. Curated Cultural Links and Discoveries
**Coverage:** [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/53ad4247?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [Kottke.org](https://kottke.org)

[The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/53ad4247?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) offered its characteristic blend of thoughtful curation, featuring pieces on why the Iranian regime seems invincible ("Leaderless protests are brave, but fragile"), a comparison of homelessness in the Bay Area versus Mumbai's slums ("Being homeless was perceived as an individual failure. There is, of course, nothing to romanticise about Mumbai's slums. But despite these hardships, they also have a real sense of community"), and a revisionist account of WASPs in American history.

[Kottke.org](https://kottke.org) highlighted diverse discoveries: ice surfing on the St. Lawrence River, astronomers discovering "Cloud-9" (a failed galaxy containing no stars), Condé Nast forgetting to renew the Gourmet trademark (allowing journalists to relaunch it as a worker-owned co-op), and a 100-year-old self-playing violin with three vertically mounted violins and a rotating bow of 1,300 horsehairs.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### Technology as Addiction and Control
Multiple newsletters wrestled with technology's addictive properties. [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/4712d231?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) described Twitter addiction among elites who couldn't leave despite child porn, [Jon Haidt from After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16) documented social media's harmful effects on adolescent brains during the sensitive period of puberty, and [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email) explored how exercise watches can shift from tools we use to tools that use us.

### The Expertise Paradox
Both [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/all-gas-town-no-brakes-town) and [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email) identified a crucial paradox: the people successfully using AI tools are experts who built their expertise through decades of hands-on work. This raises the profound question of whether future generations can develop expertise if they rely on AI from the start, potentially creating a crisis of knowledge transmission.

### Individual vs. Collective Solutions
Multiple pieces highlighted the limits of individual action in addressing technological harms. [Jon Haidt from After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16) argued parents can't solve collective action problems alone and need legislative help to escape the "but everyone else has one" trap. [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email) emphasized that "data surveillance and extraction, algorithmic assumptions about who we are and what we want...aren't problems individuals can solve by setting better boundaries." [Patrick Tanguay (Sentiers)](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b) highlighted the need for collective infrastructure solutions through digital sovereignty.

### The Body as Technology Interface
[Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email)'s interview with Vanessa Chang offered a crucial framework: technologies don't remove us from our bodies—they reshape how we inhabit them. Technologies are "architectures that organize our bodies in space and time." This resonated with [Jon Haidt from After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16)'s focus on puberty as a sensitive period when brain-sculpting by social media does lasting damage to developing neural pathways.

### Dark Patterns in Platform Design
[Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/4712d231?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) on Twitter's addiction mechanics, [Jon Haidt from After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/mountains-of-evidence) on Meta's intentionally addictive design features (revealed in internal studies), and [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email) on how digital tools "commandeer our attention, calibrate our desires, and harvest our data" all pointed to the same reality: platforms are designed to extract value rather than serve users.

### The Value of Human Attention and Craft
Against AI-generated content and algorithmic curation, multiple newsletters advocated for slow, deliberate, human attention. [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email) emphasized that "hands are smart. Hands are curious. Hands learn. Hands know things." The act of physically drawing or making creates a different kind of knowledge than instructing AI what to create. Similarly, [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/all-gas-town-no-brakes-town) highlighted how successful AI use still depends on expert taste and conceptual understanding developed through years of hands-on practice.
