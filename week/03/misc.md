## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. ICE Operations and the Minnesota Occupation
**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://www.thefp.com/p/tgif-ice-on-ice), [Blood in the Machine](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses), [News Minimalist](https://newsletter.newsminimalist.com/p/nato-sends-troops-to-greenland-10-more-stories)

The most consequential story of the week was the escalating ICE operations in Minnesota following the shooting of protester Renee Good. [Blood in the Machine](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses) by Brian Merchant offered an extensive, anguished analysis connecting Silicon Valley's role to the current crisis:

> "The tech elite in Silicon Valley range from complicit to eager participants. OpenAI's president Greg Brockman was just revealed to be the single largest donor to Trump's MAGA Inc. Super PAC, to which he gave $12.5 million." -- [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses)

Merchant argues that technology has fundamentally undermined truth itself:

> "Social media, once promised to illuminate the sins of the powerful so as to bring them to justice, have become instruments the rich can easily manipulate to benefit themselves and their interests. Bodycams, once heralded as a high-tech means of promising accountability via transparency, have not curbed police shootings." -- [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses)

[The Free Press](https://www.thefp.com/p/tgif-ice-on-ice) took a more sardonic approach, noting polling data showing 57% disapprove of ICE's enforcement methods and 53% believe the Good shooting was unjustified. The newsletter also pointed to a viral video of an ICE agent "slipping on ice" as an unintentionally symbolic moment.

By week's end, [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/7b7966b5-418b-4de3-b3a7-997cde5f3724?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) reported the Pentagon was preparing 1,500 soldiers for possible deployment in Minnesota, with Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey stating: "I never thought in a million years that we would be invaded by our own federal government."

### 2. The Future of Code and AI Agents
**Coverage:** [Joy & Curiosity](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-70-d85), [Contraptions](https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/new-nature), [Mailbrew](content/misc/mailbrew/2026-01-17-daily-digest-1772.md)

Thorsten Ball's [Joy & Curiosity #70](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-70-d85) offered a provocative meditation on what AI agents mean for traditional codebases. Ball describes building a Rust program to automate email responses, then realizing the entire codebase could be replaced by a Markdown file with instructions for an AI agent:

> "No code, only Markdown. Yes, not every codebase can be turned into instructions for an agent, and yes, it's inefficient and costs money. But, directionally, there are quite a few things that can be deconstructed into simply an agent with the right instructions and tools." -- [Thorsten Ball](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-70-d85)

He cites Cursor's experiment running autonomous agents for a week to build "a web browser from scratch" with "over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files" and references antirez (Redis creator) encouraging readers to "not fall into the anti-AI hype."

[Contraptions](https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/new-nature) by Venkatesh Rao took a more philosophical approach, introducing the concept of "New Nature"--technology that creates laws as inviolable as natural laws. He argues public-key cryptography was the "Genesis event" of this phenomenon:

> "PKC has another feature. As many have pointed out, it is the first major technology to feature something of an asymmetry that favors the weak rather than the strong. This leads to the increasingly popular idea of 'can't be evil' technology." -- [Venkatesh Rao](https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/new-nature)

### 3. Geopolitical Analysis: Venezuela and Iran
**Coverage:** [Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/b8a1f759-c266-4e32-abb5-a26086bc1060?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [PJ Vogt](https://pjvogt.substack.com/p/the-venezuelan-curse-part-1)

[Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle) by Tomas Pueyo provided detailed economic analysis of Venezuela's oil industry following the Maduro arrest. The math is sobering:

> "Venezuela owes ~$200B, or nearly 20 years worth of production! ConocoPhillips alone is owed $12B, about a year's worth of all of Venezuela's oil revenue!" -- [Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle)

Pueyo quotes ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods: "We have had our assets seized there twice and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen and what is currently the state. Today, it's uninvestable."

On Iran, historian Niall Ferguson's essay in [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/b8a1f759-c266-4e32-abb5-a26086bc1060?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) argues American liberals consistently misread revolutions. He notes that current Iranian protests should be understood as counter-revolutionary, not revolutionary:

> "The 1979 revolution was a radical one... But Iranian society is no longer aligned with the revolution's implied return to the 9th century. Iran has become a highly literate (close to 90 percent), highly urbanized (close to 80 percent) society since 1979." -- [Niall Ferguson](https://substack.com/redirect/b8a1f759-c266-4e32-abb5-a26086bc1060?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

### 4. Trump's Greenland Gambit
**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/7b7966b5-418b-4de3-b3a7-997cde5f3724?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [News Minimalist](https://newsletter.newsminimalist.com/p/nato-sends-troops-to-greenland-10-more-stories), [Mailbrew](content/misc/mailbrew/2026-01-19-daily-digest-1774.md)

[The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/7b7966b5-418b-4de3-b3a7-997cde5f3724?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) reported Trump's escalating demands to acquire Greenland, including imposing 10% tariffs on Denmark and six other European countries starting February 1, rising to 25% in June. European leaders were reportedly considering $93 billion in retaliatory tariffs.

[News Minimalist](https://newsletter.newsminimalist.com/p/nato-sends-troops-to-greenland-10-more-stories) reported NATO allies sent troops to Greenland as Denmark called for common defense, with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen declaring Greenland's defense a "NATO-wide concern."

### 5. Cultural Commentary and Personal Essays
**Coverage:** [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-anchovy-principle-how-to-build-sauce-berets-are-cool), [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-books-everyone-loves-and-why), [Erik Davis](https://www.burningshore.com/p/thar-she-blows)

[Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-anchovy-principle-how-to-build-sauce-berets-are-cool) offered "The Anchovy Principle" -- a surprisingly profound meditation on fashion, identity, and the psychology of wearing unfamiliar clothing (in this case, berets). The metaphor: anchovies can overwhelm a dish when added raw, but when cooked into a sauce, they melt and enhance everything:

> "Somewhere down the line, your clothes melt into your whole mf gestalt. In turn, your sense of self expands to accommodate garments that once seemed too potent, and they become such an integrated part of your look that you stop seeing them." -- [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-anchovy-principle-how-to-build-sauce-berets-are-cool)

[Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-books-everyone-loves-and-why) published a provocative essay on "signal books" -- books people carry to signal taste rather than because they've been genuinely moved by them:

> "When a book leaves my inner structure unchanged, I don't care how celebrated it is -- this sentence took me a long time to say without apologising." -- [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-books-everyone-loves-and-why)

She distinguishes between recognition and dislocation: "To recognise yourself is easy. To be moved out of yourself is harder. Recognition flatters. Dislocation transforms."

[Erik Davis](https://www.burningshore.com/p/thar-she-blows) wrote about rereading Moby Dick for an upcoming seminar, finding in it elements of "cosmic horror" that prefigure Lovecraft:

> "The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes." -- quoted in [Erik Davis](https://www.burningshore.com/p/thar-she-blows)

### 6. History and Anthropology
**Coverage:** [Adjacent Possible](https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/the-agrarian-fall), [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/network-centric-warfare-from-f-14s), [Beth Mathews](https://bethmathews.substack.com/p/the-design-history-behind-the-i-am)

Steven Johnson's [Adjacent Possible](https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/the-agrarian-fall) challenged the "agriculture as catastrophe" narrative popularized by Harari and Diamond, noting a "massive, unexplained gap" between crop domestication and the emergence of agrarian states:

> "If we were expelled from the Garden, it appears we spent several thousand years loitering by the exit." -- [Steven Johnson](https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/the-agrarian-fall)

[Beth Mathews](https://bethmathews.substack.com/p/the-design-history-behind-the-i-am) provided a deep dive into the design history of the "I AM A MAN" protest poster from the 1968 Memphis sanitation workers' strike, including typeface identification (Gothic No. 6243) and the story of Rev. Malcolm Blackburn, whose printing press in Clayborn Temple produced the iconic signs.

### 7. The Better Software Conference and Organizational Quality
**Coverage:** [Digital Grove](https://www.rfleury.com/p/the-magic-of-the-better-software)

Ryan Fleury's [Digital Grove](https://www.rfleury.com/p/the-magic-of-the-better-software) offered an extended reflection on the Better Software Conference and "Eternal September" -- the phenomenon where organizational quality necessarily diminishes as membership grows and exclusivity decreases:

> "People are not fungible... the initial formulation of an organization -- who is in it -- is critical. Beyond that, the degree to which both exclusive selection and 'noob training' continue to occur determines the organization's age." -- [Ryan Fleury](https://www.rfleury.com/p/the-magic-of-the-better-software)

Fleury defends invite-only structures against charges of elitism, arguing that quality organizations require selection based on shared passion and capability, not demographics.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Technology's Political Implications**: Multiple newsletters grappled with technology's role in political crisis. [Blood in the Machine](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses) directly blamed Silicon Valley for enabling authoritarianism, while [Contraptions](https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/new-nature) offered a more nuanced view of technology as potentially capture-resistant. [Joy & Curiosity](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-70-d85) largely avoided politics but its discussion of AI agents replacing code has obvious workforce implications.

**The Difficulty of Transformation**: Both [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-books-everyone-loves-and-why) on books and [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-anchovy-principle-how-to-build-sauce-berets-are-cool) on fashion explored how difficult genuine change is -- whether changing one's literary taste or one's wardrobe. Both argue that discomfort is necessary for growth.

**Geopolitical Instability**: From Venezuela to Iran to Greenland to Minnesota, the week's coverage reflected a world in flux. [The Free Press](https://www.thefp.com/p/tgif-ice-on-ice) sardonic tone couldn't mask genuine alarm, while [Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle) and Ferguson's Iran piece provided historical frameworks for understanding current crises.

**Skepticism of Conventional Wisdom**: [Adjacent Possible](https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/the-agrarian-fall) challenged the agricultural revolution narrative; [Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2026/01/17/5-bullet-friday/) profiled Michel Thomas, whose language-learning method defied linguistic orthodoxy; [Joy & Curiosity](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-70-d85) questioned whether traditional codebases will survive the AI era.

- [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-books-everyone-loves-and-why) arguing that many celebrated books are "erotically inert" -- meaning they lack genuine desire and contradiction
- [Joy & Curiosity](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-70-d85) suggesting Markdown files with AI instructions may replace traditional codebases
- [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/b8a1f759-c266-4e32-abb5-a26086bc1060?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) (Ferguson) framing Iranian protests as counter-revolutionary rather than revolutionary
- [Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle) demonstrating Venezuela's oil is essentially "uninvestable" despite being the largest reserves in the world
