## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Venezuela's Oil and Political Future

**Coverage:** [Tomas Pueyo from Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle), [PJ Vogt](https://pjvogt.substack.com/p/the-venezuelan-curse-part-1), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/c1a6be13-980a-4fa1-8332-43b05b163c4c?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

The week saw intense focus on Venezuela following the U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro. [Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle) provided a detailed economic analysis questioning whether Venezuelan oil extraction is economically viable, given the country's superheavy crude and massive infrastructure needs.

> "Venezuela's Oil Today... each barrel yields around $29 in profit. For 1.1M barrels per day, that's ~$32M per day, or ~$11.7B per year... Compare this to the current situation in the country: The Venezuelan government's last budget asked for ~$20B, or almost twice the revenue that can be obtained from oil production." — [Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle)

The analysis revealed Venezuela owes ~$200B (nearly 20 years of production), with ConocoPhillips alone owed $12B. ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods declared the situation "uninvestable" after having assets seized twice before.

[PJ Vogt](https://pjvogt.substack.com/p/the-venezuelan-curse-part-1) launched a series on "The Venezuelan Curse," interviewing historian Alejandro Velasco about why a resource-rich country has proven so difficult to govern. The piece positioned Venezuela's struggles within a longer historical arc.

### 2. ICE Operations and American Authoritarianism

**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/c1a6be13-980a-4fa1-8332-43b05b163c4c?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses)

The shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis dominated domestic coverage. [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses) provided the week's most comprehensive and damning analysis, connecting Silicon Valley's complicity to the broader authoritarian project.

> "Silicon Valley and AI have helped usher in an age where we find ourselves forced to question the nature of reality itself. Tech companies, products (like AI), and platforms like X have chipped away at and undermined our confidence in the nature of 'truth,' and in the institutions once entrusted to arbitrate it, and left a vacuum in its place." — [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses)

Merchant detailed tech companies' financial incentives, noting that OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI all secured contracts worth up to $200 million each with the DoD, while Palantir's ICE contract netted $30 million. He revealed OpenAI president Greg Brockman as the single largest donor to Trump's MAGA Inc. Super PAC at $12.5 million.

> "Consent is simply being manufactured preemptively, or in realtime, all the time. The consent manufactory is on autopilot, mostly on X, where there is an omnipresent incentive structure for users to create content that feeds the state's preferred narratives." — [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses)

[The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/c1a6be13-980a-4fa1-8332-43b05b163c4c?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) covered the incident from multiple angles, with reporters dispatched to Minneapolis and legal analysis of the shooting.

### 3. Trump and Federal Reserve Independence

**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/303f3f75-d80e-491c-9555-9b62d8c82325?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

[The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/303f3f75-d80e-491c-9555-9b62d8c82325?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) published an editorial condemning the Justice Department's criminal investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell over testimony about building renovations.

> "The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president." — Jerome Powell, quoted in [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/303f3f75-d80e-491c-9555-9b62d8c82325?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

The piece argued that Trump's lawfare, coming after he himself overcame "the biggest onslaught of lawfare in American history," would "repel moderate voters" and risk the economy.

### 4. Brain-Computer Interface Breakthroughs

**Coverage:** [Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-openai-and-sam-altman-back-merge-labs-bci)

[Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-openai-and-sam-altman-back-merge-labs-bci) broke the story of Merge Labs, a new BCI company backed by Sam Altman, OpenAI, and others with $252 million in seed funding. The approach uses ultrasound technology combined with protein reporters to interface with the entire brain non-invasively.

> "One of our core beliefs is that we can build brain computer interfaces that can interface with many more neurons in the brain than is possible with existing technologies in a form factor that is much less invasive than existing technologies." — Mikhail Shapiro, [Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-openai-and-sam-altman-back-merge-labs-bci)

Unlike electrode-based approaches like Neuralink, Merge Labs aims to use ultrasound to peer "many centimeters deep into the brain" while preserving resolution to "a hundred microns," potentially covering "huge swaths, if not the entire brain."

> "We fundamentally believe that restoration and augmentation live on a continuum. The technologies that restore function today for the people who have lost it are the same technologies that eventually create new functions if people want them." — Sumner Norman, [Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-openai-and-sam-altman-back-merge-labs-bci)

### 5. Health and Optimization

**Coverage:** [Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2026/01/06/ketosis-practical-guide-dom-dagostino/)

[Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2026/01/06/ketosis-practical-guide-dom-dagostino/) published his weekly roundup featuring a podcast episode on using ketosis for enhanced mood, cognition, and long-term brain protection with Dr. Dominic D'Agostino, alongside guided meditation content with Zen Master Henry Shukman.

### 6. Cultural Commentary and Acquired Tastes

**Coverage:** [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-anchovy-principle-how-to-build-sauce-berets-are-cool), [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-books-everyone-loves-and-why), [Erik Davis](https://www.burningshore.com/p/thar-she-blows), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/9c3a6daa-ee44-42c6-8752-ccf2876f611e?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

[Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-anchovy-principle-how-to-build-sauce-berets-are-cool) introduced "The Anchovy Principle," arguing that piquant items—whether food or fashion—require time to integrate into your "whole mf gestalt." The piece used berets as a case study for how formerly acceptable items become culturally loaded, then potentially return to acceptability.

> "Somewhere down the line, your clothes melt into to your whole mf gestalt. In turn, your sense of self expands to accommodate garments that once seemed too potent, and they become such an integrated part of your look that you stop seeing them. The taste of the anchovies no longer smacks you across the face, but it's still there, adding flavor." — [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-anchovy-principle-how-to-build-sauce-berets-are-cool)

[Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-books-everyone-loves-and-why) questioned the cult of universally praised books, distinguishing between "signal books" (carried to confer fluency) and books that genuinely transform the reader.

> "When a book leaves my inner structure unchanged, I don't care how celebrated it is—this sentence took me a long time to say without apologising... Recognition flatters. Dislocation transforms. Too many books settle for the first and call it depth." — [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-books-everyone-loves-and-why)

[Erik Davis](https://www.burningshore.com/p/thar-she-blows) reflected on rereading Moby Dick for an upcoming seminar, positioning it as foundational "weird naturalism"—combining respect for natural fact with piercing into "the glittering and haunted void."

> "There is nothing like the chewy, resonating, and demanding claims of The Good Shit. And there is no richer, more glorious, and more fecund, fungi-festooned pile than Moby Dick." — [Erik Davis](https://www.burningshore.com/p/thar-she-blows)

[The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/9c3a6daa-ee44-42c6-8752-ccf2876f611e?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) recommended the Apple TV show "Pluribus" by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan, describing it as a high-tech dystopia exploring the dangers of endless comfort without struggle: "to be human is not to be perfect."

### 7. Historical and Scientific Deep Dives

**Coverage:** [Steven Johnson from Adjacent Possible](https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/the-agrarian-fall)

[Steven Johnson](https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/the-agrarian-fall) examined the agricultural revolution, challenging the narrative popularized by Harari and Diamond that agriculture was simply "history's biggest fraud." He explored the mysterious gap between crop domestication and agrarian states.

> "If we were expelled from the Garden, it appears we spent several thousand years loitering by the exit." — [Steven Johnson](https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/the-agrarian-fall)

Johnson noted that Genesis itself frames agriculture as divine punishment: "As a punishment for tasting the forbidden fruit, God sentences humanity to a life of farming."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Truth and Reality Under Siege**: Multiple newsletters grappled with epistemic crisis. [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses) argued that social media and AI have "chipped away at our confidence in the nature of 'truth,'" while [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/303f3f75-d80e-491c-9555-9b62d8c82325?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) warned about "weaponizing the Justice Department" to manufacture preferred narratives. [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-books-everyone-loves-and-why) noted in literature how "agreement" is confused with "depth," mirroring the broader cultural pattern.

**Acquired Tastes and Transformation**: [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-anchovy-principle-how-to-build-sauce-berets-are-cool), [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-books-everyone-loves-and-why), and [Erik Davis](https://www.burningshore.com/p/thar-she-blows) all explored themes of patience, difficulty, and transformation. Whether anchovies, challenging literature, or Moby Dick, the message was consistent: meaningful change requires discomfort and time to integrate.

**Geopolitical Instability**: Venezuela featured prominently across [Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle), [PJ Vogt](https://pjvogt.substack.com/p/the-venezuelan-curse-part-1), and [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/c1a6be13-980a-4fa1-8332-43b05b163c4c?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), while Iran protests were covered by [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/c1a6be13-980a-4fa1-8332-43b05b163c4c?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8). The week painted a picture of a "world on fire" with democratic institutions under pressure.

**Tech's Dual Nature**: [Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-openai-and-sam-altman-back-merge-labs-bci) showcased technology's promise (brain-computer interfaces for human augmentation), while [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses) detailed its dangers (enabling authoritarianism through surveillance and narrative control). The contrast highlighted technology's role as both frontier and threat.
