## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. The Philosophy and Practice of Intelligence
**Coverage:** [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/review-how-to-solve-it-by-george?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app)

The week's most substantial piece examined George Pólya's *How to Solve It*, a 1945 mathematical text that has profoundly influenced modern problem-solving methodology. The review challenged fundamental assumptions about intelligence, arguing against both the fatalistic view that intelligence is purely innate and the naive optimism that superficial interventions can boost it.

> "Intelligence is the ability of an agent to achieve its goals... I sincerely believe that following these steps or other steps like them, and painstakingly amassing a set of 'moves' for your mental toolbox, and cultivating the virtues of endurance and courage, will massively increase your measurable intelligence in the sense of your ability to accomplish your goals and impose your will upon the world." — [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/review-how-to-solve-it-by-george?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app)

The review traced Pólya's four-stage problem-solving framework: understanding the problem, forming a plan, executing, and reflecting. It argued that mathematical thinking—with its emphasis on heuristics, pattern recognition, and mental tools—offers universal strategies for boosting effective intelligence. The piece connected this to AI capabilities, suggesting that much of human intelligence itself is "pattern recognition plus a good memory" operating on accumulated cultural knowledge.

### 2. Publishing Industry Realities and Success Stories
**Coverage:** [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2)

Madeline Cash's debut novel *Lost Lambs* became a case study in unconventional publishing success. The 29-year-old founder of Forever Magazine stalked her eventual FSG editor to a warehouse party in Chinatown, refused to shop the manuscript elsewhere, and secured a deal that eventually sold rights in 15 territories.

> "I essentially stalked Jackson to a party in a warehouse in Chinatown. I had always wanted to have a book out with FSG since I was a teenager... I kind of begged him to read it. I don't think that he really wanted to, but he did. Thank God. We didn't send it anywhere else." — [Madeline Cash, Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2)

Cash's trajectory involved extensive self-promotion for her earlier short story collection (published by a small press that misspelled her name), leveraging her literary magazine's cult following, and the stubborn conviction to pursue her exact desired outcome. The interview revealed the reality that traditional publishing paths remain just one option among many, though Cash acknowledged: "This is not an instruction manual for a debut writer... it's probably how people get restraining orders."

### 3. Literary Anniversaries and Intellectual Traditions
**Coverage:** [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries)

Rather than focusing on centenary celebrations of novels, Oliver highlighted three anniversaries representing a different literary tradition: Francis Bacon's death (400 years), *Gulliver's Travels* publication (300 years), and *The Wealth of Nations* publication (250 years). These works exemplify what he called the "more rational, discursive, and argumentative tradition in English literature."

> "The literary anniversaries that get the most attention tend to be centenaries and novels. These three anniversaries point to a more rational, discursive, and argumentative tradition in English literature. These writers are more practical and literal than the nineteenth-century novelists, but just as enticing and exciting to read." — [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries)

The framing challenged the dominance of fiction in literary commemoration, arguing that essays, treatises, and philosophical works deserve equal attention as literature—not just as historical documents but as masterworks of prose craft.

### 4. Despotism, Archives, and Historical Erasure
**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-agykly-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yk)

Helen Epstein's essay on Idi Amin's Uganda examined how historian Derek Peterson reconstructed an archive from bureaucratic detritus—finding documents "buried under layers of old bicycles, junked photocopiers," with some being used as toilet paper. The most striking discovery was what wasn't there: evidence of state-sponsored atrocities had been systematically scrubbed.

> "Historians need to ask themselves how common that is. Can we ever really understand the past any more than we can understand ourselves?" — [Helen Epstein, New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-agykly-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yk)

Epstein drew connections between Uganda's historical despotism and contemporary American politics, suggesting a troubling regression: "Instead of Uganda moving toward some modern ideal, the US and certain other Western countries are regressing to a state of despotism more like Uganda's under Amin and Museveni."

### 5. Contemporary Fiction Recommendations
**Coverage:** [Max Read](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXhyZWFkLnN1YnN0YWNrLmNvbS9wL2EtdG9tLWNsYW5jeS1tZWV0cy1qZWZmLXZhbmRlcm1lZXI_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRM056VTJNVGtzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RjME1EYzFNeXdpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TXpNeU56VXpMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpreU9EY3pJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS5ibDJINzRHYnA3bDVPMkxna3NwdkEwQnhud0dkcDItWDB1SFZuNXdGb0ZFIiwicCI6MTg0Nzc1NjE5LCJzIjozOTI4NzMsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg3NDA3NTMsImV4cCI6MjA4NDMxNjc1MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.AiiTNb3tERRKRlqoGIsq1IXI2HhWeGkI-arUIwBfRAw?), [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2)

Daniel H. Wilson's *Hole in the Sky* offered genre-bending Native American sci-fi, while Larissa Pham's *Discipline* explored artistic practice and power dynamics. [Max Read](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXhyZWFkLnN1YnN0YWNrLmNvbS9wL2EtdG9tLWNsYW5jeS1tZWV0cy1qZWZmLXZhbmRlcm1lZXI_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRM056VTJNVGtzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RjME1EYzFNeXdpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TXpNeU56VXpMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpreU9EY3pJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS5ibDJINzRHYnA3bDVPMkxna3NwdkEwQnhud0dkcDItWDB1SFZuNXdGb0ZFIiwicCI6MTg0Nzc1NjE5LCJzIjozOTI4NzMsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg3NDA3NTMsImV4cCI6MjA4NDMxNjc1MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.AiiTNb3tERRKRlqoGIsq1IXI2HhWeGkI-arUIwBfRAw?) praised Wilson's book as "an extremely propulsive first-contact thriller" that begins as Tom Clancy-style military fiction before "transforming into VanderMeer-esque cosmic horror."

### 6. Bible as Literature
**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-astujd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p)

Marilynne Robinson announced two seminar series on the Old and New Testaments, framing the Bible explicitly as "a very great literature" vulnerable to contemporary "misuse and ridicule." The framing emphasized literary appreciation over religious doctrine: "Over centuries writers returned to these texts, confident of finding a high order of meaning in them."

### 7. French Poetry and Translation
**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aejyo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a)

Emmanuel Hocquard's *Elegies* received promotion alongside other French poetry translations. Peter Gizzi praised the work: "It is a major event to have Emmanuel Hocquard's masterwork available to a new audience.... The capacious voice of these poems conjures a layered presence where each perception feels far away in time and yet extraordinarily intimate and direct."

### 8. Indian Literature
**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aetrz-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jh)

[New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aetrz-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jh) spotlighted Amit Chaudhuri with a sale on his novels and essay collection. The promotional material noted his status as "a remarkable prose stylist and keen innovator of literary form" and "one of the most singular voices in contemporary letters."

### 9. International Politics and Literary Journalism
**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-afllo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z), [Max Read](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXhyZWFkLnN1YnN0YWNrLmNvbS9wL3RhbGtpbmctbWlubmVhcG9saXMtdmVuZXp1ZWxhLWVsb24_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRMU5qazVOakVzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RRM09UTXpNQ3dpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TURjeE16TXdMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpreU9EY3pJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS4ySk9aWE0ycjdha1cyUEEwaWpJbGFLdG1ubXBLd0E4N3FjZ1FyQXBPbzgwIiwicCI6MTg0NTY5OTYxLCJzIjozOTI4NzMsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg0NzkzMzAsImV4cCI6MjA4NDA1NTMzMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.vjPBuJqxUtVwbG3v4w-xzMG_MTFr2Uaeu4VL4TZAssg?)

[The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-afllo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z) covered Iran's communication blackout during protests, while [Max Read](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXhyZWFkLnN1YnN0YWNrLmNvbS9wL3RhbGtpbmctbWlubmVhcG9saXMtdmVuZXp1ZWxhLWVsb24_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRMU5qazVOakVzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RRM09UTXpNQ3dpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TURjeE16TXdMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpreU9EY3pJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS4ySk9aWE0ycjdha1cyUEEwaWpJbGFLdG1ubXBLd0E4N3FjZ1FyQXBPbzgwIiwicCI6MTg0NTY5OTYxLCJzIjozOTI4NzMsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg0NzkzMzAsImV4cCI6MjA4NDA1NTMzMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.vjPBuJqxUtVwbG3v4w-xzMG_MTFr2Uaeu4VL4TZAssg?) discussed Minneapolis, Venezuela, and Trump administration politics through a podcast chat format.

### 10. American Culture Through British Eyes
**Coverage:** [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/driving-like-a-video-game)

Henry Oliver offered wry observations on American driving culture from a British immigrant's perspective, noting drivers who "drive like they are in a video game" and the ease with which he passed Virginia's driving test: "I nearly asked them if they weren't sure they didn't need to see more than me changing lanes."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**The Intelligence Question**: Both [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/review-how-to-solve-it-by-george?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app) and [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2) grappled with what it takes to succeed intellectually or creatively. The Pólya review proposed systematic methods for boosting intelligence, while Cash's publishing story suggested that strategic persistence and networking matter as much as raw talent.

**Power and Erasure**: [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-agykly-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yk) examined how authoritarian regimes deliberately erase historical records, while [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries) noted how certain literary traditions get overlooked in favor of novels. Both pointed to the ways dominant narratives obscure alternative histories.

**The Undervalued Canon**: Multiple newsletters highlighted overlooked or underappreciated works. [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries) championed essays and treatises over novels, [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-astujd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p) positioned the Bible as literature, and [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aejyo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a) promoted Emmanuel Hocquard's French poetry. The week seemed preoccupied with recuperating non-fiction and non-Anglophone traditions.

**Commercial vs. Literary**: [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KF6Q2WRJQEMHJXN3N636EMWK_3) newsletters focused on bestsellers and promotions (Agatha Christie, Rachel Reid's hockey romance series), while the more literary-focused newsletters engaged with difficult or challenging works. This split reflects ongoing tensions in how books are marketed versus how they're studied.
