# Week 03 Philosophy Newsletter Analysis (January 12-18, 2026)

## Overview

This week's philosophy newsletters reveal profound anxieties about contemporary politics, identity, and the fragility of civilization. [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) anchored the week with warnings about political radicalization and "Weimar America," drawing explicit parallels between Nazi-era psychology and contemporary extremism. [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) explored civilizational collapse through the lens of 1177 BC, while [Slavoj Žižek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) critiqued US imperialism in Venezuela and deconstructed debates around biological sex versus cultural gender. The convergence is striking: ancient lessons about societal breakdown meet urgent contemporary warnings about dehumanization, conspiracy theories, and the psychological conditions that enable totalitarianism.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Political Radicalization and Weimar Parallels
**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag), [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/weimar-america-and-a-smoldering-world)

Rod Dreher dedicated multiple essays to analyzing what he calls the radicalization of Gen Z conservatives, drawing on Laurence Rees's *The Nazi Mind* to understand contemporary extremism. His most comprehensive piece examined a New York Magazine article about the fight for influence over Turning Point USA following the (apparently fictional) assassination of Charlie Kirk. Dreher argues that exposure to conspiracy theories and scapegoating on social media creates psychological conditions similar to those that enabled Nazism.

> "We are all creatures of a particular time and place... If we ever get fascism or communism in America, it won't come the way it came to Germany and Russia. It will come in an American way, through means particular to our own era." — [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag)

Dreher highlights psychological research showing that early exposure to digital media affects the amygdala, intensifying the "Them/Us" reactions already present in normal brain development. He notes that young right-wing influencers are particularly focused on "Israel and issues having to do with national identity—particularly ethnic identity," echoing Nazi-era volkisch thinking.

In his Sunday post, [Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/weimar-america-and-a-smoldering-world) reported on Nick Fuentes and associates performing Nazi salutes at a Miami nightclub, calling it evidence of "conditioning people to see Jews as subhuman." He explicitly compares contemporary America to Spain before its 1936 civil war, warning of extremism on both left and right.

### 2. Civilizational Collapse: Ancient Warnings
**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons), [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor)

Classical Wisdom examined the Bronze Age collapse of 1177 BC, when the Mycenaean, Hittite, and other great civilizations simultaneously vanished. The newsletter draws parallels to modern fragility, asking what happens when interconnected systems fail catastrophically. The Mycenaean collapse remains mysterious—possibly caused by earthquakes, invasions, climate change, or the "Sea Peoples"—but resulted in centuries of darkness and loss of literacy.

> "Imagine one day waking up to a world gone…dark. Suddenly there was no internet. No wifi or signal, no electricity, and no gas. Credit cards didn't work and banks were permanently closed. Modern, advanced life as we know it had ceased to exist." — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons)

The newsletter on [Mark Antony](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor) explored leadership through the lens of charisma versus discipline, asking "what sort of leaders do we admire?" Antony's story—a man who nearly became emperor but failed due to "a fatal mismatch between his nature and the age he lived in"—serves as a meditation on how personality and historical moment must align for power to be sustained.

### 3. US Imperialism and Colonial Logic
**Coverage:** [Slavoj Žižek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5)

Žižek delivered a scathing analysis of the US operation in Venezuela, comparing Trump's language about "indefinitely running the country" to Putin's "limited military operation" rhetoric about Ukraine. He argues the operation represents not democracy promotion but straightforward resource extraction and colonial expropriation.

> "Trump already promises that 'we' (the US) will be selling vast quantities of oil cheaply to its allies – in yet another crazy coincidence of opposites, giving power back to the people in Venezuela amounts to a new colonial expropriation of its vast natural resources." — [Slavoj Žižek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5)

Žižek draws historical parallels to Haiti's post-independence extortion by France and the 19th-century Opium Wars, where Britain enforced "free trade" through military violence. He notes the irony of Russian statements about respecting sovereignty applying equally to Ukraine, and warns of a "slide from a mostly rules-based world to one of competing spheres of influence."

### 4. Gender, Identity, and Philosophical Prohibition
**Coverage:** [Slavoj Žižek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/neither-biological-sex-nor-cultural)

In a philosophically dense piece, [Žižek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/neither-biological-sex-nor-cultural) examined the Texas A&M decision to prohibit teaching Plato's *Symposium* due to its discussion of gender fluidity. He argues both neoconservative binary sexuality and trans celebration of gender plasticity miss the "constitutively traumatic nature of sexuality brought out by psychoanalytic theory."

> "The neoconservative patriarchal claim that there are two sexes grounded in biology... and the trans celebration of the multiple choices of our gender identity share a key feature – they both ignore the constitutively traumatic nature of sexuality brought out by psychoanalytic theory and practice." — [Slavoj Žižek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/neither-biological-sex-nor-cultural)

Žižek observes that prohibition of Plato reveals absurdity on both extremes: conservative censorship mirrors progressive censorship in its refusal to engage with complexity. He suggests trans identities achieving "star status" in media indicates they "fit perfectly with global capitalism, without disturbing in any serious way its basic antagonisms."

### 5. Community Formation and the Benedict Option
**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/a-millennial-benedict-option-in-denmark)

[Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/a-millennial-benedict-option-in-denmark) highlighted a documentary about young Danish families—Millennials, both Lutheran and Catholic—who left urban Denmark for rural communal living centered on "shared values and shared faith." The community represents an ecumenical response to post-Christian secularism in one of Europe's most secular nations.

> "I have no money, but I am a rich man." — Mikkel Sotbaek, quoted in [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/a-millennial-benedict-option-in-denmark)

This story of intentional community building contrasts sharply with the week's themes of breakdown and radicalization, offering a constructive religious alternative to both secular materialism and political extremism.

### 6. Totalitarianism Through Comfort
**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/noble-lesbian-savage-fights-for-humanity)

Dreher reviewed the Apple TV series *Pluribus*, reading it through the lens of Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*—totalitarianism achieved through pleasure rather than pain. The show's protagonist, a lesbian novelist, and her Catholic ally from Paraguay both resist a world where suffering has been eliminated, arguing that "the right to be unhappy" is essential to freedom and humanity.

> "Everything has a cost!" — Manousos Oviedo's declaration in *Pluribus*, quoted in [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/noble-lesbian-savage-fights-for-humanity)

Actor Carlos-Manuel Vesga explained his character's Catholic worldview: "There's many kinds of Catholics, but I grew up with the kind of Catholic that accepts that life is hardship and suffering and strife, and in a way, that makes it worth living."

### 7. Classical Theater and Cultural Transmission
**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle), [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-sea-of-homer-live-conversation)

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle) examined Roman theater's adaptation of Greek tragedy, noting how Romans preferred violent spectacle while maintaining philosophical depth through Seneca's plays. Seneca's tragedies "struck a chord with the masses" by embedding "turmoil and personal conflict" within mythological frameworks, making philosophy accessible through drama.

The newsletter also promoted an upcoming live conversation with Emily Wilson, translator of Homer's *Odyssey* and *Iliad*, to explore why these works remain relevant: "Homer doesn't give easy answers, and neither does our world."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Psychology of Extremism and Collapse
A dominant thread connects [Dreher's](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) analysis of political radicalization with [Classical Wisdom's](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) examination of Bronze Age collapse: both explore how seemingly stable systems can disintegrate rapidly. Dreher cites research on brain development showing young people are "most likely to commit your life to becoming Mother Teresa" or "join some hateful ideology"—the same life stage when Bronze Age youth would have experienced civilizational collapse.

### Imperial Logic Across Millennia
[Žižek's](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) critique of US imperialism in Venezuela resonates with [Classical Wisdom's](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor) analysis of Roman power struggles. Both examine how power masks itself in ideological justification—Trump's "democracy promotion" parallels ancient Rome's civilizing mission. The Haiti parallel Žižek invokes (forcing freed slaves to pay for their freedom) echoes the tributary systems of ancient empires.

### Religion as Psychological Bulwark
Both [Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/a-millennial-benedict-option-in-denmark) and the actor in [*Pluribus*](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/noble-lesbian-savage-fights-for-humanity) emphasize Catholicism's embrace of suffering as meaningful. This directly challenges both totalitarian comfort (Huxley) and totalitarian violence (Orwell). Dreher argues "active, serious Christianity is the only barrier" to political extremism, while the *Pluribus* character embodies how "life is hardship and suffering and strife, and in a way, that makes it worth living."

### Censorship Ironies
[Žižek's](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/neither-biological-sex-nor-cultural) observation about banning Plato pairs ironically with [Classical Wisdom's](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle) note that violence in Greek theater happened "ob scene" (off-stage, hence "obscene"). Both left and right increasingly prefer to keep uncomfortable ideas off-stage entirely, whether Plato's gender fluidity or conservative viewpoints on campuses.

### The Amygdala and Ancient Warnings
[Dreher's](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) discussion of how social media affects the amygdala—the part of the brain processing "Them vs. Us"—connects to [Classical Wisdom's](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) theme of civilizations that couldn't adapt to rapid change. The neurological vulnerabilities that make Gen Z susceptible to conspiracy theories might parallel the psychological conditions that prevented Bronze Age societies from coordinating responses to the cascading crises of 1177 BC.

## Notable Quotes

> "Charlie, I take notes and apply to my life. [Fuentes] is a character; he likes to humor people." — Lesley Lachman on consuming extremist content, quoted in [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag)

> "In order to understand why the Nazis possessed the mentalities they did, we must embrace the reality of a fundamental truth: we are all creatures of a particular time and a particular place." — Laurence Rees, quoted in [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag)

> "The answer to the question 'Which is worse, Trump or Maduro?' is: both are worse." — [Slavoj Žižek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5)

## Emerging Questions

1. **Can liberal democracies survive permanent psychological warfare via social media?** Dreher's analysis suggests digital platforms create neurological conditions resembling those that enabled 20th-century totalitarianism, even without comparable material suffering.

2. **Does resistance to extremism require religious frameworks?** Multiple articles suggest secular liberalism lacks the psychological resources to resist either "soft" totalitarianism (comfort-based) or "hard" totalitarianism (violence-based).

3. **Are we witnessing a new Bronze Age collapse?** Classical Wisdom's focus on 1177 BC implicitly asks whether our interconnected global systems could face similar cascading failures.

4. **How do empires rationalize extraction?** Žižek's Venezuela analysis and Classical Wisdom's Roman history both examine how power dresses exploitation in moral language.

5. **What is the relationship between spectacle and philosophy?** The discussion of Roman theater raises questions about whether violence and entertainment can coexist with deep moral thinking—relevant to contemporary media culture.
