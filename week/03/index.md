# Week 03 Newsletter Rollup (January 12-18, 2026)

## Executive Summary

This was a week of converging crises and technological transformation. The dominant stories across all categories were the ICE shooting in Minneapolis and subsequent federal escalation, the Iranian regime's brutal crackdown on protesters (with death tolls reaching 12,000), and the Trump administration's DOJ investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. These events drew coverage from tech, politics, culture, philosophy, and miscellaneous newsletters alike, revealing how deeply political turmoil has permeated all areas of discourse.

On the technology front, Anthropic's Claude Code and Cowork ecosystem dominated developer conversations, with [Platformer](https://www.platformer.news/r/5a69b93c?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670) declaring it a potentially transformative moment for non-programmers comparable to ChatGPT's original debut. Apple's partnership with Google to power Siri with Gemini marked a decisive end to speculation about AI partnerships, while the Grok deepfake scandal escalated to international regulatory responses with Indonesia and Malaysia becoming the first nations to ban an AI chatbot. Meanwhile, [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) proclaimed "software development is dead" as autonomous AI coding loops demonstrate the ability to build software "cheaper than a burger flipper."

Across philosophy and culture newsletters, writers grappled with civilizational fragility, drawing parallels between the Bronze Age Collapse, Weimar Germany, and contemporary America. [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) warned that the assassination of Charlie Kirk represented "the Radical Right's Reichstag fire," while [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) reminded readers that complex systems fail not through single catastrophic events but through cascading pressures. Literary coverage offered both escape and engagement: [NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-agykly-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yk) drew stark parallels between Ugandan despotism and current American governance, while [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2) featured debut novelist Madeline Cash's unconventional path to publication.

[Blood in the Machine](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses) connected the operations to Silicon Valley's role in enabling authoritarianism.

### 2. Iran Crisis: Protests, Crackdown, and U.S. Intervention Debate
Iran's most severe crisis since 1979 commanded extensive coverage.

## Cross-Category Themes

### The Erosion of Truth and Institutional Trust
Multiple newsletters across categories grappled with epistemological breakdown. [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses) argued we're "well beyond epistemic closure" where documentation doesn't matter. [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/tEUdPKdLME?email=wschenk@gmail.com) captured this with the phrase "corrosive doubt." Politics newsletters emphasized concerns about the politicization of the DOJ, while culture newsletters documented how "brutal state violence and hysterical right-wing internet content work together in lockstep."

### Technology as Double-Edged Sword
From [Platformer](https://www.platformer.news/r/5a69b93c?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670)'s excitement about Claude Code to [Jon Haidt's After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16) advocating for age 16 social media minimums, newsletters grappled with technology's benefits and costs. [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/r/beead576?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410)'s Palantir expose contrasted sharply with tech companies' stated privacy commitments. [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/when-the-tech-leopard-eats-your-face/) documented the irony of Tailwind CSS firing 75% of its team because AI disrupted their business.

### Regime Change and U.S. Power Abroad
Iran and Venezuela prompted extensive debate about U.S. intervention across politics, philosophy, and books categories. [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/cp/184781656) posed the uncomfortable question: can liberals support regime change even if delivered by Trump? [Foreign Affairs](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39) featured Colin H. Kahl's "The Myth of the AI Race" pushing back against dominant competition narratives.

### The Value of Attention, Craft, and Human Agency
Against AI slop and algorithmic curation, multiple writers advocated for slow, deliberate, human attention. [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/d2fb75d1?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)'s Jide Salawu wrote of "a growing hunger for human-produced ideas, readings, and arts." [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/thank-god-it-s-whiskey-friday-with-tony-dokoupil) quoted reader Struan Donald: "The act of making a thing is partly about noticing... you have to be paying attention."

### Economic Precarity as Backdrop
From [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/b9e0c903?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)'s dystopian fiction about merging bodies to reduce living costs, to [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/mutual-aid-and-asking-people-what-they-need/)'s mutual aid stories about homeless individuals in freezing New England temperatures, economic anxiety permeated the week's commentary across all categories.
