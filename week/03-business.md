# Week 03 Business Newsletter Analysis (January 13-19, 2026)

## Overview

This week's business newsletters converged on two major themes: the transformative impact of AI coding tools on product development, and unconventional approaches to building sustainable businesses. [Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/silicon-valleys-missing-etiquette-playbook) explored how non-technical founders can now build real products using AI, while [Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd) argued that DeepSeek's lack of a business model is actually its greatest competitive advantage. Meanwhile, [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/design-systems-for-software-engineers) provided a deep dive into design systems, and [Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle) analyzed the economics of Venezuelan oil extraction.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. AI-Powered Product Development for Non-Technical People

**Coverage:** [Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-non-technical-pms-guide-to-building-with-cursor), [Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/silicon-valleys-missing-etiquette-playbook)

The democratization of software development through AI tools was a central theme this week. [Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-non-technical-pms-guide-to-building-with-cursor) featured Zevi Arnovitz, a product manager at Meta with no technical background who has developed a complete workflow for building real products using Cursor. His approach is so effective that his engineering team at Meta asks him to teach them.

Key insights from the episode include:
- Using multiple AI models for different tasks (Claude for planning, Gemini for UI)
- A "peer review" technique that uses different AI models to review each other's code
- Using slash commands to automate common prompts

> "This might be the best time to be a junior in tech, despite the challenging job market" — [Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-non-technical-pms-guide-to-building-with-cursor)

The episode referenced explosive growth in AI coding tools, including Bolt's rise from near-death to approximately $40M ARR in 5 months, and Lovable's $10M ARR achievement in just 60 days with 15 people.

### 2. DeepSeek's "No Business Model" Advantage

**Coverage:** [Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)

In a contrarian take, [Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd) argued that as the AI industry drowns in capital, DeepSeek's refusal to raise outside funding represents its most enduring competitive advantage. This comes as the first anniversary of the "DeepSeek Moment" (January 27) approaches.

> "DeepSeek's lack of business model thanks to zero outside funding is the source of its only enduring advantage: maximum internal alignment in service of AGI-bound research and nothing else." — [Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)

Xu noted that Liang Wenfeng's quant fund, High Flyer Capital, had a banner year generating more than $700 million in profit on a 53% return, enabling continued self-funding. He contrasted this with the broader trend of AI labs raising enormous sums, including xAI's $20 billion Series E round.

The organizational benefits of avoiding outside funding include:
- No internal resource competition or bureaucratic infighting over GPU allocation
- Less jealousy and toxic pecking orders based on compensation
- A flat organizational structure that can remain flat
- No commercialization pressure distorting research priorities

Xu cited Ilya Sutskever's observation that breakthrough AI research doesn't necessarily require massive compute: "AlexNet was built on two GPUs... The transformer was built on 8 to 64 GPUs."

### 3. Design Systems for Engineering Teams

**Coverage:** [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/design-systems-for-software-engineers)

[The Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/design-systems-for-software-engineers) published a comprehensive guide to design systems, drawing on insights from Michael Abernethy, principal frontend engineer at Rubrik with 25+ years of UI experience.

The piece originated from a memorable moment at Rubrik when the CTO remarked that the product looked "like a college project." This feedback catalyzed a UI overhaul that resulted in the Aura Design System Library with 90+ React-based components.

Key benefits of design systems for engineering teams:
- Faster delivery times through reusable components
- Higher quality through specialized frontend engineering
- More full-stack developers can contribute to frontend without deep CSS expertise
- "Premium feel" software that justifies enterprise pricing

> "If you want to charge enterprise prices, your software needs to look like an enterprise product." — [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/design-systems-for-software-engineers)

The article also addressed AI's limitations in this space: while AI can help with many tasks, generating a consistent design system isn't one of them.

### 4. Silicon Valley's Missing Etiquette Playbook

**Coverage:** [Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/silicon-valleys-missing-etiquette-playbook)

In an unconventional episode, [Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/silicon-valleys-missing-etiquette-playbook) featured Sam Lessin, partner at Slow Ventures and former VP of Product at Facebook, discussing why proper etiquette has become a vital skill for founders in 2026.

Lessin's framework centers on "showing up in any room with a low heart rate" to quickly build trust. His etiquette book and courses have become surprisingly popular, covering:
- Navigating introductions, small talk, meetings, and meals
- Hacks for remembering names
- Handling awkward social situations

The timing reflects a shift: as technology becomes more central to society, the ability to build trust through traditional social graces has become increasingly valuable.

### 5. The Economics of Venezuelan Oil

**Coverage:** [Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle)

[Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle) published a detailed economic analysis of Venezuela's oil potential in the context of geopolitics.

Key figures from the analysis:
- Venezuela currently produces approximately 1.1M barrels per day
- Venezuelan heavy crude sells for approximately $52/barrel (about $8 less than standard oil)
- Extraction and processing costs are approximately $23/barrel, yielding $29/barrel profit
- Annual revenue potential: approximately $11.7B
- Venezuelan government debt: approximately $200B (nearly 20 years of production)
- ConocoPhillips alone is owed $12B

The technical challenges are significant. As Nigel Harris explained:

> "The oil [in the Orinoco Valley] is extremely dense (heavier than water), extremely viscous (like pitch or molasses) and extremely dirty (over 5% sulfur and masses of metals like vanadium). The only deposit like this elsewhere in the world is Canada's Athabasca oil sands." — [Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle)

ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods was quoted as saying the situation is "uninvestable" given that oil companies have had assets seized there twice.

### 6. Creator Business Strategy and Planning

**Coverage:** [Jay Clouse](content/business/jay-clouse/2026-01-18-the-most-useful-30-minutes-of-my-week.md)

[Jay Clouse](content/business/jay-clouse/2026-01-18-the-most-useful-30-minutes-of-my-week.md) shared a practical lesson about overcoming resistance to planning. After procrastinating on creating a 2026 calendar for his membership community The Lab for three months, he completed the task in just 30 minutes.

The key insight: each scheduled tentpole event (Town Hall, mastermind matching, Lab Reports, Offline events) becomes a marketable moment with built-in urgency.

> "In an evergreen membership, moments of genuine urgency are rare and useful." — [Jay Clouse](content/business/jay-clouse/2026-01-18-the-most-useful-30-minutes-of-my-week.md)

The newsletter also featured an interview with Paul Millerd, author of The Pathless Path, who turned down a $200K book deal from Penguin to self-publish. The book has earned $325,000 in royalties to date.

### 7. Personal Optimization and Productivity

**Coverage:** [Tim Ferriss](content/business/tim-ferriss/2026-01-14-new-from-tim-how-to-use-ketosis-for-enhanced-mood-cognition-.md), [Tim Ferriss](content/business/tim-ferriss/2026-01-17-5-bullet-friday-the-wild-west-of-prediction-markets-learning.md)

[Tim Ferriss](content/business/tim-ferriss/2026-01-14-new-from-tim-how-to-use-ketosis-for-enhanced-mood-cognition-.md) released two newsletters this week. The first featured a podcast with Dr. Dominic D'Agostino on using ketosis for enhanced mood, cognition, and brain protection. The second, his "5-Bullet Friday," covered:

- Wall Street's entry into prediction markets
- Language learning via the Michel Thomas method (mastering basics in less than a week)
- Meditation with Zen Master Henry Shukman through The Way app

> "The universe is not only stranger than we suppose, but stranger than we can suppose." — J.B.S. Haldane, quoted in [Tim Ferriss](content/business/tim-ferriss/2026-01-17-5-bullet-friday-the-wild-west-of-prediction-markets-learning.md)

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Democratization of Building
Multiple newsletters touched on how traditional barriers to creation are falling. [Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-non-technical-pms-guide-to-building-with-cursor) showed non-technical PMs building real products with AI, while [Jay Clouse](content/business/jay-clouse/2026-01-18-the-most-useful-30-minutes-of-my-week.md) highlighted creators self-publishing instead of going through traditional gatekeepers.

### The Value of Constraints
Several pieces this week explored how limitations can be advantages. [Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd) argued that DeepSeek's lack of funding creates organizational alignment, while [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/design-systems-for-software-engineers) showed how design system constraints enable faster, higher-quality development.

### AI's Evolving Role in Professional Work
AI appeared across multiple contexts: as a coding assistant enabling non-technical builders, as a tool that still can't replace design system consistency, and as the focus of DeepSeek's AGI research. The consensus seems to be that AI is most powerful when paired with human judgment and domain expertise.

### Trust and Social Capital
[Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/silicon-valleys-missing-etiquette-playbook) on etiquette and [Jay Clouse](content/business/jay-clouse/2026-01-18-the-most-useful-30-minutes-of-my-week.md) on community building both emphasized that as technology advances, human connection and trust become more, not less, important.

## Surprising or Contrarian Perspectives

1. **No business model as competitive advantage:** [Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd) flipped conventional startup wisdom by arguing that DeepSeek's refusal to raise funding is its greatest strength.

2. **Etiquette as founder skill:** [Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/silicon-valleys-missing-etiquette-playbook) featuring Sam Lessin teaching etiquette to Silicon Valley founders is an unexpected pivot from a former Facebook VP.

3. **AI can't do design systems:** Despite AI's coding capabilities, [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/design-systems-for-software-engineers) noted it still can't generate consistent design systems.

4. **Venezuela is "uninvestable":** [Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle) revealed that even with geopolitical interest, major oil executives consider Venezuelan investment untenable given past asset seizures.
