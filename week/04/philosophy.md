# Week 04 Philosophy Newsletter Analysis (January 19-25, 2026)

## Overview

Week 04 presented a rich philosophical tapestry spanning ancient wisdom, contemporary crisis, and perennial questions about identity, anger, and faith. [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/from-athens-to-alabama) drew a compelling line from Socrates to Martin Luther King Jr. on civil disobedience, later exploring whether we should "let go" of grievances through the myth of Electra, presenting a novel theory about Odysseus's true identity, and hosting a live conversation with translator Emily Wilson on Homer. Meanwhile, [Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/minnesota-church-attack-and-civil) warned of "Weimar America" through the lens of church disruptions, lamented American disengagement from Europe's cultural fate, and offered an extended meditation on religious conversion across Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox traditions.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Civil Disobedience: From Socrates to Martin Luther King Jr.

**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/from-athens-to-alabama)

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/from-athens-to-alabama) examined the philosophical lineage connecting Socrates to Martin Luther King Jr. on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The article emphasized King's use of *agape*—transcendent, selfless love—as distinct from romantic (*eros*) or friendship-based (*philia*) love. This Greek concept was foundational to King's philosophy of nonviolent resistance.

> "Agape, meanwhile (in the words of MLK), 'is an overflowing love which seeks nothing in return...'" — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/from-athens-to-alabama)

The newsletter drew a direct parallel between Socrates' refusal to escape execution in Plato's *Crito* and King's acceptance of imprisonment in Birmingham. Both figures demonstrated that civil disobedience requires not only refusing unjust laws but gracefully accepting punishment to expose the injustice itself:

> "A key to civil disobedience (as Socrates and King would demonstrate) is that once we refuse to obey unjust laws, we must graciously accept the punishment, regardless of what is fair." — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/from-athens-to-alabama)

King himself explicitly invoked Socrates in his famous letter:

> "Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood." — Martin Luther King Jr., quoted in [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/from-athens-to-alabama)

The article concluded by posing a provocative question: Is Socrates' example still relevant today, or does the current world require *thumos*—righteous anger?

### 2. Warnings of Social Collapse and "Weimar America"

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/minnesota-church-attack-and-civil)

[Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/minnesota-church-attack-and-civil) argued that the United States is entering a dangerous period of instability analogous to Germany's Weimar Republic (1918-1933)—not in terms of Nazification, but in the erosion of social cohesion that precedes authoritarian collapse. Dreher focused on the disruption of a Baptist church service in Minneapolis by anti-ICE protesters, led by former CNN host Don Lemon, as a symbolic crossing of a "bright red line."

> "When I use the term 'Weimar America,' I'm not talking about the Nazification of the United States... I'm talking about the similarities between what happened in Germany, 1918-33, and what is happening in the US today — that is to say, the analogous events that produced mass psychosocial instability, resulting, ultimately, in a turn to totalitarian government." — [Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/minnesota-church-attack-and-civil)

Dreher invoked historical parallels to the Spanish Civil War, noting that widespread church desecrations in 1931 initiated a cycle of violence culminating in war by 1936:

> "The desecration of what one's opponents hold sacred is such a critical event because it is felt, and felt very deeply, as an attack on the target group's very identity." — [Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/minnesota-church-attack-and-civil)

The piece warned that such incidents "harden sides" and could provoke reciprocal escalation, including armed defense of churches.

### 3. The Psychology of Grievance: Electra and Letting Go

**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/why-you-should-let-it-go)

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/why-you-should-let-it-go) pivoted to the myth of Electra to explore a timeless philosophical question: At what point must we let go of grievance, even justified grievance? The newsletter noted that Electra, daughter of Agamemnon, becomes so consumed by vengeance for her father's murder that she risks losing her humanity.

> "Electra is a woman who cannot let go. And to many, it appears justifiable. Her father has been murdered, her mother is the murderer, and so revenge becomes her full-time job. She doesn't just want justice...she wants it loudly, publicly, and at any cost." — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/why-you-should-let-it-go)

The article observed that anger seems pervasive in contemporary culture: "Nowadays it seems as if anger is all the rage." It posed the cost of sustained animosity not to others but to ourselves—asking what happens when we cannot "bury the hatchet, let bygones be bygone, and just...move on?"

The reference to Carl Jung's "Electra Complex" (the female counterpart to Freud's Oedipus Complex) underscored how this mythological figure has become a psychological archetype for unresolved parental conflict.

### 4. Western Civilization and European Decline

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe)

[Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe) offered a meditation on American disengagement from Europe, framed as both cultural tragedy and personal grief. Writing from Europe, Dreher lamented that American elites no longer care about European affairs:

> "A lawyer friend in Texas texted me to say he was at a gathering of sophisticated legal elites this week, and not one of them gave a flying fig about Europe, or anywhere outside of America. 'We have too many problems here,' is how my friend characterized the responses." — [Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe)

Dreher drew an analogy to his own relationship with his elderly mother—both representing situations where he feels powerless to prevent a self-chosen fate. He discussed Jean Raspail's controversial 1973 novel *The Camp of the Saints* as a lens for understanding European decline, while acknowledging its racist elements:

> "For believers grappling with the influx of millions into the European first world, often contributing little to the common good of host societies, Raspail's work illuminates how a Christianity reduced to boundless empathy can lead to disaster and spiritual betrayal." — Thomas Colsy, quoted in [Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe)

The piece invoked G.K. Chesterton's observation that "the modern world is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone." Dreher saw hope in the 20,000 young Catholics at the Chartres pilgrimage, suggesting that renewal may come through the faith of younger generations who "see things with clearer eyes."

### 5. Identity, Deception, and Homer's Odyssey

**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/odysseus-real-identity)

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/odysseus-real-identity) presented a provocative reinterpretation of Homer's *Odyssey*: What if Odysseus was not really Odysseus? The article by Alberto Majrani argued that the man who killed the suitors was actually Philoctetes—the legendary archer who inherited Hercules' bow—hired by Telemachus to impersonate his long-absent father.

> "It's a strange story, that of Ulysses. Is it possible that the King of Ithaca stayed away for twenty years, missing his homeland, abandoning a beautiful nymph who would make him immortal, only to return to a wife no longer young after a dangerous solo crossing?" — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/odysseus-real-identity)

The theory explains several puzzles: no one recognizes Odysseus upon his return, the narrative emphasis on deception ("Ulysses himself...when he is in the land of the Phaeacians. Ulysses claims to be the best of the Achaeans in archery, immediately after Philoctetes!"), and the mysterious stranger's apparent lameness—consistent with Philoctetes' snake-bitten foot.

> "The Odyssey is not a fairy tale for overgrown children, but an intricate maze filled with ingenious references that will inevitably escape those who do not study it closely. Quandoque dormitat bonus Homerus—'Even good old Homer nods,' Horace proclaimed—but maybe Homer was a lot more awake than we thought!" — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/odysseus-real-identity)

### 6. Religious Conversion and Ecclesial Identity

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts)

[Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts) offered an extended meditation on why young American elites are converting to Catholicism, drawing on a piece from WORLD magazine. While overall conversion numbers favor Protestantism ("Roman Catholicism loses 8.4 members for each new person who joins"), ambitious young people in Washington, D.C. are increasingly drawn to Rome.

> "Brad Littlejohn is the director of programs and education at American Compass... He says Washington is the most prominent center of conversion to Catholicism, but that evangelical colleges with a Great Books curriculum also produce converts. That's because students from 'nonliturgical, nonhistorical, theologically shallow Protestant upbringings' get exposed to the great Catholic authors for the first time." — [Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts)

Dreher reflected on his own journey—from Methodist childhood through Catholicism to Orthodoxy—cautioning against both intellectual snobbery and convert naivete:

> "Catholics like to tell themselves that people come to the Catholic faith because they conclude that it is True... But few conversions, to any faith, are simply a matter of pure rationality... if your conversion (to Catholicism, Orthodoxy, or Protestantism) is only intellectual, or even mostly intellectual, you are on shakier ground than you realize." — [Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts)

The essay distinguished between intellectual and experiential ways of knowing—"savoir" vs. "connaitre" in French, "wissen" vs. "kennen" in German—arguing that Orthodoxy emphasizes the personal, experiential sense of knowing more than abstract propositions.

### 7. Homer's World Through Translation: Emily Wilson Conversation

**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/video-sea-of-homer-with-emily-wilson)

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/video-sea-of-homer-with-emily-wilson) reported on a live conversation with Emily Wilson, the acclaimed translator of both the *Odyssey* and the *Iliad*. The discussion explored Homer's identity, the oral tradition, and the challenges of translating ancient poetry for modern readers.

> "Emily guided us through the mysteries of Homer's identity, the power and complexity of the oral tradition, and the delicate (sometimes maddening) task of translating ancient poetry for modern readers... Along the way, she illuminated the extraordinary narrative sophistication and emotional depth of the epics, including rage, grief, love, loss, and the tangled web of human communities that feel as relevant now as they did three millennia ago." — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/video-sea-of-homer-with-emily-wilson)

The highlight was Wilson's recitation from the *Iliad* in both ancient Greek and English. The newsletter promoted an upcoming "Sea of Homer" voyage (July 1-13, 2026) with Wilson as distinguished guest lecturer, visiting sites central to Homer's world: Mycenae, Epidaurus, Delos, Patmos, Ephesus, and Istanbul.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Anger and Its Costs**: Both newsletters grappled with the role of anger in human life. [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/from-athens-to-alabama) asked whether Socratic calm or *thumos* (righteous anger) is appropriate for contemporary activism, then explored through Electra the [danger of grievance that consumes](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/why-you-should-let-it-go) the one who holds it. [Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/minnesota-church-attack-and-civil) documented escalating anger in American society without resolving whether it can be contained.

**Identity and Deception**: The theme of identity pervaded week 04. [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/odysseus-real-identity) questioned Odysseus's very identity, while [Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts) explored religious identity through conversion—how we become who we are through the traditions we join. Both suggest identity is more fluid and constructed than we typically assume.

**Historical Memory as Method**: Both newsletters relied heavily on historical parallels—[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/from-athens-to-alabama) traced the Socrates-to-King lineage, while [Rod Dreher from Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/minnesota-church-attack-and-civil) invoked Weimar Germany, the Spanish Civil War, and the Bosnian genocide. This shared methodology highlights philosophy's reliance on historical pattern recognition as a tool for understanding present crises.

**Sacred Spaces and Institutions**: [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/minnesota-church-attack-and-civil) warned that violations of religious sanctuaries trigger identity-based violence, while his [later essay on converts](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts) explored how different Christian traditions serve as spiritual homes. [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/from-athens-to-alabama) noted Socrates' ultimate loyalty to Athens despite its injustice—suggesting sacred institutions retain claims on us even when they fail us.

**The Durability of Ancient Wisdom**: All [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/from-athens-to-alabama) pieces this week demonstrated how ancient philosophy, mythology, and literature continue to illuminate contemporary experience—from civil disobedience to grievance to identity to translation itself. [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe) similarly drew on Chesterton, Newman, and the long tradition of Western Christian thought, while expressing anxiety about whether this inheritance can survive.
