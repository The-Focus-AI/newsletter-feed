## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. The Forgotten Story of Claudette Colvin and Civil Rights Revisionism

**Coverage:** [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/claudette-colvin/)

[Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/claudette-colvin/) opens with the recent death of Claudette Colvin, a 15-year-old who refused to give up her bus seat to a white woman on March 2, 1955—nine months before Rosa Parks' more famous protest. The author notes that civil rights leaders at the time considered Colvin "too much of a liability" due to her young age and rebellious nature, choosing instead to elevate Rosa Parks as "a quiet, respectable older woman" to become "the face of the movement."

This historical anecdote serves as an entry point to a broader critique of how the Civil Rights Era is taught in America—centered around "the feelings of white moderates and conservatives" rather than the radical reality of the movement.

> "First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate... who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice." — [Martin Luther King, Jr., quoted in Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/claudette-colvin/)

The newsletter emphasizes that King was "radical AF"—a socialist and working-class organizer who, contrary to sanitized versions, understood violence as "a tool for liberation" and famously stated that "a riot is the language of the unheard."

### 2. The Political Creation of MLK Day

**Coverage:** [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/claudette-colvin/)

The author reveals that MLK Day, while requested by Civil Rights groups, was ultimately passed by President Reagan in 1983—not as an honor, but as a political maneuver. According to [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/claudette-colvin/), Reagan faced criticism from the NAACP and Urban League for his "aggressive assaults on affirmative action and court-ordered busing" ahead of his reelection bid.

> "Reagan's pivot on the King holiday provided a two-pronged benefit. On the one hand it would pacify critics of his positions on civil rights, but on the other it enabled Reagan to position himself as the inheritor of King's colorblind 'dream'... in order to advance the anti-black crusade he had waged since the 1960s, now under the alluring mantle of colorblindness." — [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/claudette-colvin/)

This rebranding transformed King from a radical figure into someone more "palatable for white folks," with Reagan co-opting the "I Have a Dream" speech's message of colorblindness to justify rolling back civil rights protections.

### 3. Deliberate Disinformation and America's True Character

**Coverage:** [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/claudette-colvin/)

The newsletter concludes with a stark assessment: what Americans experience is not ignorance but "50+ years of deliberate disinformation by both conservatives and 'moderate liberals' to maintain power and suppress black liberation."

The author cites F.D. Signifier's observation that "these are not unprecedented times. This is who America is"—suggesting that current political dynamics are not aberrations but continuations of systemic patterns.

A quote from punk band Bob Vylan drives the point home:

> "White folks love quoting Martin Luther / 'Cause he held hands and prayed while they bombed his building / Good for him but the times have changed / And don't forget, white folks still killed him" — [Bob Vylan, quoted in Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/claudette-colvin/)

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

With only one newsletter in this week's uncategorized content, no cross-newsletter patterns can be identified. However, the themes presented—historical revisionism, the sanitization of radical movements, and the strategic deployment of colorblind rhetoric—would likely resonate with political and cultural commentary in other categories.

---

## Notable Perspectives

[Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/claudette-colvin/) stands out for its willingness to directly challenge mainstream civil rights narratives on MLK Day itself. The newsletter doesn't merely add context to historical figures—it explicitly frames widely-taught history as "deliberate disinformation" and connects historical patterns to contemporary politics.

The tone is unapologetically radical, using phrases like "radical AF" and "chucklefuck on Fox News" to signal its political positioning. This approach distinguishes it from more academic or cautious historical revisionism.
