# Week 04 Culture Newsletter Analysis (January 19-25, 2026)

## Overview

This week's culture newsletters were dominated by the ongoing ICE occupation of Minneapolis, which became a defining lens through which writers examined community resistance, state terror, and the role of media in shaping political reality. [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/twenty-twenty-frixx), [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/10dcd3ed?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/dental-pain-at-148800310?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148800310&utm_id=aca7bb1b-53cd-4946-b3d1-7bee87ae2940&utm_medium=email), and [Kottke.org](https://kottke.org/26/01/quick-links-kottkeorg-posts-and-links-for-january-23-2026) all provided extensive coverage of the crisis. Beyond Minneapolis, newsletters explored geopolitical realignment, the crisis in scientific communication, the death of Dilbert creator Scott Adams, and the cultural phenomenon of "influencer creep."

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. The Minneapolis ICE Occupation and Community Resistance

**Coverage:** [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/whatever-you-think-it-is-it-s-worse), [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/5ff88965?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/dental-pain-at-148800310?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148800310&utm_id=aca7bb1b-53cd-4946-b3d1-7bee87ae2940&utm_medium=email), [Kottke.org](https://kottke.org/26/01/quick-links-kottkeorg-posts-and-links-for-january-23-2026), [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/7a503526?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

The federal occupation of Minneapolis dominated culture coverage this week, with multiple newsletters providing on-the-ground perspectives and analysis. The killing of Renee Nicole Good and, later in the week, Alex Pretti by federal agents catalyzed an outpouring of writing about community resistance and state violence.

[Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/5ff88965?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) featured Myriam Gurba interviewing Minneapolis activists Christina Nicholson and Anika about organizing in the Powderhorn neighborhood. Nicholson emphasized the importance of mutual aid networks that emerged after the George Floyd murder:

> "I don't think those fuckers were ready for all of this and how quickly we mobilized." -- [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/5ff88965?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

[Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/whatever-you-think-it-is-it-s-worse) opened with an allegorical bus kidnapping story before pivoting to the occupation, quoting Minneapolis resident Scott Meslow's assessment that when friends ask if the situation is as bad as it looks, his answer is "no, it's worse."

[Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/what-have-you-on-148618464?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148618464&utm_id=db18eab7-2c14-43c3-9eee-539f7f3e3878&utm_medium=email) and [Culture Study (Sunday)](https://open.patreon.com/posts/dental-pain-at-148800310?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148800310&utm_id=aca7bb1b-53cd-4946-b3d1-7bee87ae2940&utm_medium=email) both opened with calls to support Powderhorn and Columbia Heights families and provided links to footage analysis of the shootings.

[Kottke.org](https://kottke.org/26/01/quick-links-kottkeorg-posts-and-links-for-january-23-2026) compiled extensive links to Minneapolis coverage, including Margaret Sullivan's piece arguing "With Democracy in Free Fall, the Media Must (Finally) Wake Up."

### 2. Media, Propaganda, and Political Reality

**Coverage:** [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/10dcd3ed?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/whatever-you-think-it-is-it-s-worse), [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-january-26/), [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/7a503526?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

Zach Rabiroff's essay in [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/10dcd3ed?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) provided a striking media analysis comparing two videos: the White House's slickly produced propaganda piece celebrating the Maduro kidnapping, and the raw citizen footage of Renee Nicole Good's murder. Rabiroff traced the history of political media manipulation from Rosser Reeves's 1952 Eisenhower ads through Neil Postman's critique to Trump's "content-creation presidency":

> "Trump's presidency represents the inevitable end point of the decontextualization of politics: pure mass theater wholly unrelated to the world it affects, right up until the moment the effects become impossible to deny." -- [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/10dcd3ed?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

[Sam Circle's New Yorker Review](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-january-26/) found Clare Malone's profile of Bari Weiss disappointingly thin, noting the most striking quote came from Weiss's wife Nellie Bowles, who said she "'went to bed with this adorable opinion writer and woke up next to Les Moonves.'"

[Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/7a503526?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b) featured Joan Westenberg's piece arguing that modern discourse functions as a "Distributed Denial-of-Service attack" on cognition:

> "The discourse takes the most important problem of our time and converts it into an infinite series of tribal skirmishes, each of which generates heat and engagement while bringing us no closer to answering any of the actual hard questions." -- [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/7a503526?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

### 3. Geopolitical Realignment and the End of American Hegemony

**Coverage:** [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/abdc5b3c?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/whatever-you-think-it-is-it-s-worse), [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/ca9393dc?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

Mark Carney's speech at the World Economic Forum was highlighted by [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/abdc5b3c?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), who called it essential reading. Carney argued that for "middle powers" like Canada, the American-led international order "no longer works" and that "if we're not at the table, we're on the menu."

[Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/whatever-you-think-it-is-it-s-worse) noted Wall Street Journal financial columnist James Mackintosh comparing the muted market response to Trump's Greenland threats to the reaction following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914.

[Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/ca9393dc?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) published a moving dispatch from Nigerian linguist Kola Tubosun, who drew parallels between his experiences under Nigerian military dictatorships and the current American moment:

> "When Trevor Noah warned in 2016 that Trump reminded Africans of an African dictator, it made all the sense in the world to someone whose formative years were spent on that continent. Now, ten years later, Trump has achieved a status that would make even an Idi Amin blush." -- [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/ca9393dc?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

### 4. The Death of Scott Adams and the Dilbert Legacy

**Coverage:** [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/6f14da7d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [The Browser (Saturday)](https://thebrowser.com/r/c7bb70dd?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd)

[The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/6f14da7d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) recommended Scott Alexander's lengthy eulogy for Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert. Alexander's assessment was both sympathetic and scathing:

> "Adams knew, deep in his bones, that he was cleverer than other people. God always punishes this impulse, especially in nerds. He created Adams only-slightly-above-average at everything except for a Mozart-tier skill at making silly comics about hating work. Too self-aware to deny it, too narcissistic to accept it, he spent his life searching for a loophole." -- [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/6f14da7d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd)

### 5. Scientific Writing and Communication Crisis

**Coverage:** [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/behold-deeply-148719274?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148719274&utm_id=6525a169-8abe-41ea-959e-e8e9b9c496d5&utm_medium=email)

[Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/behold-deeply-148719274?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148719274&utm_id=6525a169-8abe-41ea-959e-e8e9b9c496d5&utm_medium=email) featured an extensive interview with Bethann Garramon Merkle about the crisis in scientific writing instruction. Merkle traced the problem to the 19th-century German university model and the deliberate exclusion of natural history from amateur practitioners. Her diagnosis was damning:

> "We have a niche genre, written in a faux-objective, over-formalized tone unlike how we communicate in any other format...inaccessible to most readers due to paywalls and that forced formality of tone...which all science trainees are expected to gain proficiency in, without being taught to do so." -- [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/behold-deeply-148719274?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148719274&utm_id=6525a169-8abe-41ea-959e-e8e9b9c496d5&utm_medium=email)

The interview traced the history from Aristotle through the German Romantic movement to modern academia, revealing how scientific writing became deliberately exclusionary to gatekeep prestige and expertise from "genteel" amateurs and marginalized groups.

### 6. Influencer Culture and Digital Life

**Coverage:** [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/is-everyone-now-148724549?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148724549&utm_id=043603bc-243f-44eb-9fec-bff2bc3167f0&utm_medium=email), [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/twenty-twenty-frixx)

[Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/is-everyone-now-148724549?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148724549&utm_id=043603bc-243f-44eb-9fec-bff2bc3167f0&utm_medium=email) interviewed Sophie Bishop about "influencer creep" -- the ways influencer behaviors have filtered into everyone's online existence, from LinkedIn profiles to Instagram posts of houseplants. Bishop coined the term to describe the normalization of self-branding, performance of authenticity, and constant optimization.

[Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/twenty-twenty-frixx) coined the term "twenty twenty frixx" for the year's cultural vibe, riffing on the "friction-maxxing" trend and covering drama in the "Heated Rivalry" fan community.

### 7. AI and Consciousness

**Coverage:** [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/7a503526?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

[Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/7a503526?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b) highlighted neuroscientist Anil Seth's essay arguing that conscious AI remains highly unlikely because consciousness probably requires biological life, not just computation. Seth challenged the assumption that implementing the right algorithms suffices for consciousness:

> "Inside a brain, there's no sharp separation between 'mindware' and 'wetware' as there is between software and hardware in a computer. The more you delve into the intricacies of the biological brain, the more you realize how rich and dynamic it is, compared to the dead sand of silicon." -- [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/7a503526?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

### 8. Literature, Arts, and Cultural Criticism

**Coverage:** [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/), [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/24c50d56?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/9da3c4a6?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [Met Opera](https://www.metopera.org/season/in-cinemas/2025-26-season/the-amazing-adventures-of-kavalier--clay/)

[Sam Circle's Weekend Special](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/) delivered an enthusiastic roundup of avant-garde New York theater, praising "Friday Night Rat Catchers" as a twisted view of our malignant culture and "Try/Step/Trip" as a potentially masterful autobiographical rap musical.

[Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/24c50d56?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) published Rax King's essay "Sex Tourist," a reexamination of "Sex and the City" and promiscuity as a form of education and self-creation:

> "I came to see -- and, frankly, still see -- my promiscuity as a form of tourism; a way of seeing and knowing the world." -- [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/24c50d56?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

[The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/9da3c4a6?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) highlighted an essay on sheep in period dramas as signifiers of economic reality, and a piece on Japanese death poems (jisei).

[Met Opera](https://www.metopera.org/season/in-cinemas/2025-26-season/the-amazing-adventures-of-kavalier--clay/) promoted the cinema broadcast of Mason Bates's opera adaptation of Michael Chabon's "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay," featuring a pair of Jewish cousins who create a fascist-fighting superhero.

[Sam Circle's main review](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-january-26/) took issue with Jill Lepore's review of a Bernie Sanders biography, calling it "unconscionable" for its dismissive tone and noting that "she seems to think Bernie's message is one of anger and 'scolding,' just rants about bankers, as though she's deaf to the second half of that message, which is about finding community and support with other working people."

### 9. Historical Perspectives and Lost New Yorks

**Coverage:** [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/10dcd3ed?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/c7bb70dd?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd)

Anna Merlan's essay in [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/10dcd3ed?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) explored the 1939 Federal Writers Project guide to New York City, finding in it both a vanished city and a parallel one. The guide, which employed writers like Ralph Ellison and Zora Neale Hurston, was eventually strangled by the House Un-American Activities Committee as a "hotbed of Communists":

> "Reading the guidebook now gives the sense, not of a past city, but a parallel one, an unseen but strangely familiar river flowing just over the horizon. There, Sunset Park is a Finnish and Scandinavian neighborhood, filled with 'Finnish steam baths,' local food, and societies where the homeland culture is kept alive." -- [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/10dcd3ed?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

[The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/c7bb70dd?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) recommended a piece on genealogical research and a great-great-grandmother named Bertha who fled Minsk in the 1800s: "Dozens of people are alive today because this great-great-grandmother decided to flee instead of remain, and was lucky enough to survive."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Minneapolis as Cultural Touchstone:** The ICE occupation became the dominant cultural story of the week, with nearly every newsletter finding angles into it -- from direct activism coverage to media criticism to personal essay. The community resistance became a model discussed across [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/twenty-twenty-frixx), [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/5ff88965?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), and [Kottke.org](https://kottke.org/26/01/quick-links-kottkeorg-posts-and-links-for-january-23-2026).

**Historical Rhymes:** Multiple newsletters drew connections between current events and historical parallels -- 1914, 1939, Nigerian military dictatorships -- suggesting that historical literacy is essential for understanding the present moment. [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/whatever-you-think-it-is-it-s-worse) wondered whether we're in 1933 or 1938; [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/ca9393dc?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) found echoes of Babangida and Abacha.

**The Limits of Discourse:** Both [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/7a503526?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b) and [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/10dcd3ed?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) examined how media saturation and decontextualization prevent meaningful engagement with reality -- until reality becomes impossible to ignore.

**Finding Humanity in Crisis:** Amid the political coverage, newsletters found space for humanizing stories -- the kindness of strangers in [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/whatever-you-think-it-is-it-s-worse), the immigrant tall-bike builder in Cuba in [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/5ff88965?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), the promiscuity-as-education essay in [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/24c50d56?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122).
