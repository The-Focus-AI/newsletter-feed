## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Literary Analysis and Fiction Criticism
**Coverage:** [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/)

Sam Circle's review of Joseph O'Neill's "Light Secrets" offered sophisticated literary analysis that touches on fundamental questions about storytelling itself. The review praised O'Neill's ability to achieve absurdism without surrealism, noting:

> "Absurdism is almost invariably tied tightly to surrealism; that O'Neill manages the former without the latter is impressive, and the last line of the interview reveals that Simon Morgan, the presence hovering over the story, is real (or comparatively real, since O'Neill suggests he may be getting his name wrong). The concrete is confabulated but the spectral is honest; this paradox is at the heart of O'Neill's fiction, and maybe storytelling more generally." — [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/)

The analysis identifies what might be borderline self-pastiche—divorced middle-aged protagonists navigating enigmatic New York—but argues that O'Neill executes this formula with unmatched subtlety and conviction.

### 2. Mortality and Death Across Cultures
**Coverage:** [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/6f14da7d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd)

[The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/6f14da7d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) featured two powerful pieces on mortality: Scott Alexander's 10,400-word eulogy for Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert) and Roger's Bacon's compilation of Japanese death poems (Jisei). The Alexander piece offered a penetrating psychological portrait:

> "Adams knew, deep in his bones, that he was cleverer than other people. God always punishes this impulse, especially in nerds. He created Adams only-slightly-above-average at everything except for a Mozart-tier skill at making silly comics about hating work. Too self-aware to deny it, too narcissistic to accept it, he spent his life searching for a loophole." — [Scott Alexander via The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/6f14da7d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd)

The Japanese death poems ranged from the vivid ("Cherry blossoms fall on a half-eaten dumpling") to the humorous ("Raizan has died to pay for the mistake of being born: for this he blames no one, and bears no grudge"), representing a centuries-old tradition of composing poetry in one's final moments.

### 3. Experimental Theater and Performance Art
**Coverage:** [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/)

[Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/) provided extensive coverage of New York's Under the Radar, Live Artery, Exponential, and Prototype festival performances. The standout was "Friday Night Rat Catchers" at New York Live Arts:

> "I'll start with the middle one, which was the highlight and will surely be among the three or four best things I see all year: Friday Night Rat Catchers at New York Live Arts, a movement-theater comedy about the hideousness and awkwardness of mainstream cultural product – vaguely referencing the Lawrence Welk show in its creakiest late-70s era, but extending beyond it... I squealed with laughter and horror throughout this fresh, twisted view of our malignant culture." — [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/)

The review also highlighted "Try/Step/Trip," an autobiographical rap musical about first-generation Black male identity and the justice system, describing it as "tightly paced, clever, deeply felt but not even a little maudlin."

### 4. Debunking Creativity Myths: The Boredom Research
**Coverage:** [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/6f14da7d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd)

An interview with boredom researcher Kristen French challenged popular assumptions about boredom's relationship to creativity. While famous people often claim "I was bored, so I did X" to suggest boredom fuels creativity, research shows the opposite:

> "Researchers have found the opposite to be true: the more bored people got, the less creative they were. Creativity is a great answer to boredom, but 'you can't hope that it works the other way around.'" — [Kristen French & James Danckert via The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/6f14da7d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd)

This counterintuitive finding corrects a widespread misconception about creative work.

### 5. Parental Portraits and Family Memoir
**Coverage:** [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/)

John Lahr's 1996 profile "My Mother the Ziegfeld Girl" demonstrated remarkable restraint in chronicling a highly invasive parent. [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/) praised Lahr's ability to maintain distance while creating an empathetic yet unforgiving portrait:

> "Lahr's ability to maintain a measure of distance from his mother, who was obviously highly invasive, is remarkable; nowadays, we'd expect Lahr to pivot back and forth from memoir to autobiography, but he keeps the frame tightly on his childhood view of his parents, without touching much at all on what it means to him now." — [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/)

The review particularly highlighted a scene where young John pulls over the car to force his mother to admit her affair—a moment that reveals character without requiring additional commentary.

### 6. Tonal Ambiguity in Cultural Writing
**Coverage:** [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/)

[Sam Circle's](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/) analysis of John Phipps's "When a Man Loves a Cello" identified a fascinating tonal complexity:

> "A lyrical human-interest story, sappier than this magazine almost ever gets, but charming and funny anyway... Isserlis' anxious care for the cello is so overdetermined it's hard not to think Phipps is writing with a smirk, which makes the apparent tonal sincerity ('There seemed to be an element of destiny at work'... 'I felt grateful for the cumulative human effort that had produced this ether from horsehair, sheep gut, and wood') ring a bit false. He wants to laugh at the obsessive cellist and cry with him, too." — [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/)

This observation about wanting to simultaneously mock and empathize reflects broader tensions in contemporary cultural criticism.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Art of Curation and Critical Distance

Both newsletters excel at curation while maintaining critical perspective. [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/6f14da7d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) aggregates exceptional long-form content across topics (from mountain lion statistics to Scottish forests), while [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/) filters New Yorker content and New York theater through a discerning, opinionated lens. Neither simply summarizes—both actively interpret and evaluate.

### Mortality, Memory, and Biographical Distance

Both newsletters engaged with how writers approach mortality and memory. [The Browser's](https://thebrowser.com/r/6f14da7d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) curation placed Scott Alexander's Scott Adams eulogy alongside Japanese death poems, creating an implicit dialogue between Western psychological analysis and Eastern poetic acceptance. [Sam Circle's](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/) praise of John Lahr's memoir emphasized similar concerns about biographical perspective and the challenge of writing about difficult parents.

### The Observational Trend

[Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/) closed with a striking cultural observation: an unprecedented amount of full-frontal nudity across New York's experimental theater festivals. While individual shows justify their choices, the collective trend raised questions about whether this represents genuine artistic necessity or emerging convention. This meta-observation—stepping back to notice patterns across cultural production—mirrors [The Browser's](https://thebrowser.com/r/6f14da7d?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) editorial approach of connecting disparate pieces into larger patterns.
