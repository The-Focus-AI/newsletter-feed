## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Political Corruption and American Democracy

**Coverage:** [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/democracy-by-henry-adams), [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhyd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-m)

Henry Oliver's extended analysis of Henry Adams's 1880 novel *Democracy* in [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/democracy-by-henry-adams) resonates with contemporary concerns about political corruption. Adams, grandson of John Adams and son of John Quincy Adams, wrote the novel anonymously as a critique of Gilded Age politics. Oliver notes that while "the corruption of 1880 looks rather hum-drum at this distance," the novel's insights remain relevant.

> "Democracy is the government of the people, by the people, for the benefit of Senators." — [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/democracy-by-henry-adams)

The novel's villain, Senator Ratcliffe, offers a defense that Oliver finds uncomfortably prescient:

> "If Washington were President now, he would have to learn our ways or lose his next election. Only fools and theorists imagine that our society can be handled with gloves or long poles." — [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/democracy-by-henry-adams)

Meanwhile, [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhyd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-m) published a stark interview with Joseph O'Neill titled "The Politics of Raw Power," examining the Trump administration's use of ICE and Border Patrol as "political security forces." O'Neill distinguishes between "technical politics" (electoral strategy) and "the politics of raw power," arguing that Republican leadership is "fundamentally devoted to achieving one-party rule."

> "It's night in America. And the darkness is spreading quickly beyond our borders." — [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhyd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-m)

### 2. The Defense of the Humanities

**Coverage:** [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should)

Henry Oliver's lengthy essay "Good letters made good men" in [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should) offers a passionate, if deliberately unsystematic, defense of literary study. Oliver expresses frustration with the constant demand to justify humanities education in instrumental terms.

> "The humanities are not necessary because they make us better thinkers, writers, people, or workers... Literature is why we need the formal study of literature. We live by words." — [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should)

Oliver argues that literature operates through "tacit knowledge"—understanding that cannot be reduced to rubrics or arguments:

> "There is a certain moment when we read or hear great literature and we think ah, I know what they mean, I never knew that I knew that, but right now, here, I really do, and it is only in that moment that we fully understand it." — [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should)

The essay includes an extended meditation on Ingmar Bergman's *Fanny and Alexander*, arguing that art is not escapism but "a way of conceiving of the bigger world."

### 3. Philosophical Universalism vs. Identity Politics

**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awhug-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p)

[New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awhug-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p) promoted Omri Boehm's *Radical Universalism: Beyond Identity* with a striking quote from Jennifer Szalai of *The New York Times*:

> "An invigorating and timely new book... [Boehm] has persuaded me that universalism could be more profoundly transformative than anything offered by the self-styled 'radicals' on either end of the political spectrum." — [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awhug-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p)

Boehm's argument that both left and right reflect "the politics of identity"—with the right speaking of "blood and soil" and the left of "gender and race"—positions humanistic universalism as an alternative to partisan tribalism.

### 4. Literary Retellings and Classic Literature

**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aydtjit-36F2A313-iruduywlh-d), [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhik-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jk)

[New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aydtjit-36F2A313-iruduywlh-d) highlighted Michel Tournier's *Friday*, a retelling of *Robinson Crusoe* that inverts the colonial assumptions of Defoe's original. The newsletter quotes Tournier's autobiography:

> "What was Friday to Daniel Defoe? Nothing: an animal, at best a creature waiting to receive his humanity from Robinson Crusoe, who as a European was in sole possession of all knowledge and wisdom." — [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aydtjit-36F2A313-iruduywlh-d)

[The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhik-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jk) covered Gertrude Stein extensively, with Hermione Lee reviewing a new biography by Francesca Wade and the newsletter resurfacing William H. Gass's 1973 two-part essay. Gass's assessment of Stein's prose innovation remains striking:

> "In the history of language no one had written like this before, and the result was as striking in its way, and as successful, as Ulysses was to be." — [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhik-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jk)

### 5. Internet Culture and Political Power

**Coverage:** [Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-commenters-won)

[Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-commenters-won) offered a fascinating analysis of how internet commenters have ascended to political power, prompted by Ben Smith's reporting that a Trump administration appointee was radicalized by being banned from Gawker's comments section. The essay identifies Sarah B. Rogers, the State Department's undersecretary for public diplomacy, as a former prolific Gawker commenter who created multiple sock-puppet accounts.

> "We are ruled, as it turned out, not only by ghouls, fascists, sociopaths, salesmen, influencers, mediocrities, and abusers, but by something stranger and potentially worse: Gawker commenters." — [Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-commenters-won)

Read argues that the commenter's subject position—"your voice is (literally) suppressed, made subordinate"—generates a resentment that powers Trumpist politics.

### 6. Twentieth-Century Theater and Female Heroines

**Coverage:** [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aydiix-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p)

[The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aydiix-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p) announced Daniel Mendelsohn's upcoming seminar series "Drama Queens," examining "four masterpieces of American theater" featuring unforgettable heroines: Eugene O'Neill's *A Long Day's Journey into Night*, Tennessee Williams's *The Glass Menagerie* and *A Streetcar Named Desire*, and Edward Albee's *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?*

> "These plays suggest that well into the twentieth century, the archetypes established by the Greeks continued to be useful for male playwrights; the question that confronts us, as we end our series, is why?" — [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aydiix-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p)

### 7. Art and Visual Culture in Books

**Coverage:** [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asqid-36F2A313-iruduywlh-tk), [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkitl-36F2A313-iruduywlh-ik)

Art Editor Leanne Shapton's newsletter [Neigh!](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asqid-36F2A313-iruduywlh-tk) provided a behind-the-scenes look at the art selections for the January 15, 2026 issue, including work by Izzy Barber, Yann Kebbi, Elliott Puckette, and Louise Bourgeois. The newsletter connects literary content to visual art in thoughtful ways.

Meanwhile, the [Reader's Catalog newsletter](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkitl-36F2A313-iruduywlh-ik) promoted merchandise celebrating women in art and science, featuring Rachel Ignotofsky's illustrations and items promoting banned books and library advocacy.

### 8. New Fiction and Book Promotions

**Coverage:** [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KFEM74JWXGAXMD4BGP4YA2KV_6)

[Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KFEM74JWXGAXMD4BGP4YA2KV_6) promoted Lynn Cullen's *When We Were Brilliant*, described as "a brilliant new novel of friendship and fame" featuring Marilyn Monroe. Other promotions included Mike Bond's thriller *Crude*, Alice Feeney's *My Husband's Wife*, Shen Tao's dark fantasy debut *The Poet Empress*, and *Longevity Made Simple* by Shad Marvasti.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Democracy Under Threat:** The most striking convergence this week was the concern about American democracy across very different publications. [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/democracy-by-henry-adams) and [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhyd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-m) both examined political corruption and authoritarianism—one through 1880s fiction, the other through contemporary journalism. The resonance between Adams's Gilded Age critique and O'Neill's analysis of current events was striking: both identify a "culture of corruption" that transcends individual bad actors.

**The Humanities Crisis:** [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should) explicitly engaged with debates about liberal education, while [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhik-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jk) coverage of Gertrude Stein implicitly makes the case for difficult, experimental literature. Both newsletters argue that literature provides something irreducible to instrumental justifications.

**Digital Culture's Political Consequences:** [Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-commenters-won) analysis of internet commenters in politics connects to broader themes about media, power, and resentment that appear across the literary coverage this week.

**Women's Contributions:** From the Reader's Catalog's [Women in Art and Science merchandise](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkitl-36F2A313-iruduywlh-ik) to Mendelsohn's ["Drama Queens"](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aydiix-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p) seminar to [coverage of Gertrude Stein](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhik-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jk), women's artistic and intellectual contributions received sustained attention.

## Surprising Insights

- The revelation that a State Department undersecretary was radicalized by being banned from Gawker comments is both absurd and telling about the digital genealogy of current political movements.

- Henry Oliver's confession that he feels "petulant" about defending the humanities and his admission that "Literature has already gone out with the tide as a central part of culture" represents an unusual candor from a literary newsletter.

- The fact that Henry Adams's *Democracy* remained anonymous until his death in 1921—over 40 years after publication—suggests a level of insider critique that today's pundits rarely achieve.
