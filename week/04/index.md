# Week 04 Newsletter Rollup (January 19-25, 2026)

## Executive Summary

Week 04 saw two crises dominate: **Minneapolis ICE operations** escalating to two fatal shootings of US citizens (Renee Good and Alex Pretti), triggering Senate Democrats to threaten blocking DHS funding, and **Trump's Greenland gambit** that rattled markets before a vague "framework" was announced at Davos. On the technology front, xAI's 1-gigawatt Colossus 2 cluster and Cursor's FastRender (built by 2,000+ parallel AI agents) signaled a new era of AI infrastructure, while [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/r/be07145c?m=d9c8ed7d-8f51-45be-865b-ff329f323410) exposed ICE's facial recognition app returning two different wrong names for the same detained woman.

Culturally, the Minneapolis occupation became a lens for examining community resistance, state violence, and media's role in shaping political reality. [Citation Needed](https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-99/) exposed how cryptocurrency's $130M+ campaign contributions have effectively "bought themselves a Congress," while [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/midterm-polls-have-good-news-great) showed Democrats leading the 2026 generic ballot by 5.3 points.

[Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/1160b5b2?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) offered a contrarian perspective from a former rapid-response organizer arguing activism has evolved from legal support into dangerous obstruction.

### 2. Trump's Greenland Gambit Rattles NATO
Trump's tariff threats against Europe pushed gold to record highs and rattled allies. Germany warned he'd crossed a "red line," the EU prepared €93B in retaliation. Historian Niall Ferguson argued Trump "won Davos, hands down" despite appearing to de-escalate.

### 3. AI Infrastructure Revolution
- **xAI Colossus 2**: 1 gigawatt, 200,000 Blackwell GPUs, 11 exaFLOPs peak AI performance
- **FastRender**: Cursor's browser built by 2,000+ AI agents with 1M+ lines of Rust
- **Inference startups**: BaseTen ($300M), RadixArk ($400M), Inferact ($150M) racing to solve serving bottlenecks

### 4. Crypto's Congressional Capture
Coinbase CEO withdrew support for a Senate bill; the hearing was immediately canceled. Senator Warren: "Evidently, the industry writes the bill and if anybody has the nerve to slightly amend it, the industry says that the whole thing is off."

### 5. ICE Facial Recognition Failures
Court testimony revealed Mobile Fortify returned two different wrong names for the same detained woman. EFF noted ICE treats it "like it's a 100% accurate record retrieval system... when this could never be true."

## Cross-Category Themes

### Minneapolis as Cultural Touchstone
The ICE crisis dominated both political and cultural coverage. [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/whatever-you-think-it-is-it-s-worse), [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/5ff88965?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), and [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/dental-pain-at-148800310) all centered on community resistance, with [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/10dcd3ed?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) drawing parallels between White House propaganda and raw citizen footage.

### AI: From Training to Inference Era
Multiple newsletters converged on the thesis that training-era thinking is giving way to inference-era economics. [TheSequence](https://thesequence.substack.com/p/the-sequence-radar-795-the-new-inference) captured it: "We are moving from a world where we spend billions to create intelligence, to one where we spend billions to serve it."

### Trump's Behavioral Transformation
[The Atlantic Daily](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/kidnapped-baghdad/685470/) analyzed how Trump 2.0 differs from 1.0: "The president's recent follow-through on his threats represents a real shift... During his first term, Trump was defined by his tendency to back down."

### The Humanities in Crisis
[The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should) offered a passionate defense of literary study, while [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/behold-deeply-148719274) interviewed Bethann Garramon Merkle on why scientific writing has become deliberately exclusionary.
