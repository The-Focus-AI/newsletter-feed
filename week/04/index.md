## Top Stories Across All Categories

### 1. Trump's Greenland Gambit Threatens NATO
Trump's sustained campaign to acquire Greenland through tariffs rattled allies and markets alike. Germany warned he'd crossed a "red line," the EU prepared €93 billion in retaliation, and some German politicians floated boycotting the World Cup. Chinese officials were reportedly "gleefully anticipating Europe's humiliation."

### 2. Crypto Industry's Congressional Capture
Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong withdrew support for a Senate crypto bill, and the hearing was immediately canceled. Senator Warren: "Evidently, the industry writes the bill and if anybody has the nerve to slightly amend it, the industry says that the whole thing is off."

### 3. ICE Facial Recognition Failures
Court testimony revealed ICE's Mobile Fortify app returned two different incorrect names when scanning the same detained woman. The EFF noted ICE has treated it "like it's a 100% accurate record retrieval system... when this could never be true from a technical perspective."

### 4. xAI's Gigawatt-Scale AI Cluster
xAI activated Colossus 2, the first operational 1-gigawatt AI training cluster with 555,000 GPUs purchased for ~$18B. Training frontier models now bottlenecks on power availability rather than just compute access.

### 5. Elizabeth Tsurkov's Kidnapping Account
[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/kidnapped-baghdad/685470/) published the researcher's harrowing firsthand account: "I was kidnapped by idiots"—offering rare insight into authoritarian brutality.
