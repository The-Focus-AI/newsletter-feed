# Week 04 Newsletter Rollup (January 19-25, 2026)

## Executive Summary

Week 04 (still early in the week with limited coverage) was dominated by escalating transatlantic tensions over Trump's Greenland ambitions. [Bloomberg Weekend](https://bloom.bg/3BMztSF) reported gold and silver surging to record highs while US futures tumbled on trade war fears, as Germany warned Trump had "reached a red line" and the EU prepared €93 billion in retaliatory tariffs. Meanwhile, [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/zhipu-and-minimax-ipo) provided deep analysis of China's first two AI company IPOs—Zhipu and MiniMax—revealing fundamental differences in their approaches to state involvement and business models.

On the technology front, [Sam Schillace](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/the-hard-part-isnt-doing-the-work) offered a philosophical meditation on the emerging "attention saturation" problem: as AI makes starting work trivial, the bottleneck shifts to human review capacity. "The hard part isn't doing the work now; it's choosing the work."

## Top Stories

### 1. Trump's Greenland Gambit Rattles Markets
Trump's aggressive pursuit of Greenland escalated from rhetoric to concrete economic threats. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent doubled down on the position, signaling sustained policy direction. The consequences extend beyond Greenland itself—potentially "tearing NATO apart," as The Economist put it.

### 2. China's AI IPO Moment
Zhipu and MiniMax became the world's first two pure-play AI companies to go public. [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/zhipu-and-minimax-ipo) revealed stark differences: Zhipu as a "state-fund darling" with Tsinghua roots targeting B2B/government, versus MiniMax's consumer focus with its 20-million-user AI companion app Talkie. Most striking: "The AI girlfriend business has razor-thin margins. The average customer spent only US$5 in the first nine months of 2025."

### 3. The Attention Saturation Problem
[Sam Schillace](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/the-hard-part-isnt-doing-the-work) argued we're at a critical AI inflection point similar to the early internet's maturation. The surprising consequence of effective AI agents isn't reduced workload but attention bottlenecks—"You will have as many things going on as you can pay attention to."

### 4. Religious Desecration as Political Threshold
[Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/minnesota-church-attack-and-civil) analyzed the disruption of a Minneapolis Baptist church service as a critical escalation point, drawing historical parallels to Weimar Germany and the Spanish Civil War.
