## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Trump, Greenland, and the Davos World Economic Forum

**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/7b7966b5-418b-4de3-b3a7-997cde5f3724?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/b3089b02-2009-4f04-9b92-74edfb4a1382?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/f6b060a2-ecc4-4f20-a20d-85e4f19472b1?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/7ad42d8f-44c5-48f3-a282-073102a7b534?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/04d5f637-a68e-44dc-aae4-d1d19dd71546?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

Trump's aggressive push to acquire Greenland from Denmark dominated the week, culminating in his appearance at Davos. Historian Niall Ferguson provided the most incisive analysis, arguing that contrary to the narrative that Europeans "won" by getting Trump to de-escalate, "Trump won Davos, hands down."

> "I have never before seen a single individual so completely dominate this vast bazaar of the powerful, the wealthy, the famous, and the self-important." -- [Niall Ferguson in The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/7ad42d8f-44c5-48f3-a282-073102a7b534?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

Ferguson drew a striking parallel to the ancient Melian Dialogue from Thucydides, where the Athenians told the Melians: "right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must." Canadian PM Mark Carney explicitly quoted Thucydides in his Davos speech.

Ferguson's contrarian take: Trump was bluffing all along--only about half his Truth Social threats materialize, and the Greenland gambit was likely "maskirovka" (distraction) to keep Europeans from meddling in Middle East and Ukraine policy while Kushner and Witkoff headed to Moscow.

The TGIF column offered satirical coverage of Trump's new "Board of Peace"--a parallel UN with $1 billion permanent membership fees--and his AI-generated images of Greenland conquest.

### 2. Immigration Enforcement and Family Separation

**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/f2cd1175-2e2e-4cb9-af7e-c47bd2b68b94?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/7b7966b5-418b-4de3-b3a7-997cde5f3724?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/ad401c49-11e1-4540-9ac0-d709452a537b?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [Blocked and Reported](https://www.blockedandreported.org/p/episode-291-oh-canada-with-jonathan-0bd)

The most affecting piece of the week was Carrie McKean's long-form investigation into Maribis Beleno, a Venezuelan mother deported without her three children. The piece profiled Elias Rodriguez, a Trump-supporting evangelical pastor who drove five hours to rescue the abandoned children and eventually flew them back to Venezuela to reunite with their mother.

> "I understand that the government should do it, but guess what? They are not doing it. So what is the church going to do? Are we just going to stand idly by and watch children and mothers hurt?" -- [Pastor Elias Rodriguez in The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/f2cd1175-2e2e-4cb9-af7e-c47bd2b68b94?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

The story highlighted the tension between supporting tough immigration enforcement and the human cost of its execution--Rodriguez voted for Trump but says separating children from parents is wrong regardless of politics.

Meanwhile, [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/ad401c49-11e1-4540-9ac0-d709452a537b?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) covered Bill Pulte at the Federal Housing Finance Agency, dubbed "Little Trump," who allegedly used his position to access mortgage data on political enemies including Lisa Cook of the Federal Reserve.

### 3. AI, Technology Policy, and the State

**Coverage:** [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/what-trump-really-wants-with-ai), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/b4558688-f466-4a01-b8c2-c7cd3b1e0aa4?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [News Minimalist](https://newsletter.newsminimalist.com/p/renewables-overtake-fossil-fuels-in-eu-9-more-stories), Mailbrew

Brian Merchant offered the week's most substantive analysis of Trump's AI policy, arguing it represents not deregulation but a "Big AI State" project concentrating federal power:

> "Trump's agenda is not a push for 'deregulation' as much as it is, like the Greenland threats he uses AI to illustrate, a deliberate quest for domination." -- [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/what-trump-really-wants-with-ai)

Merchant cited policy papers arguing the administration is (1) derisking domestic infrastructure through favorable land use and financing, (2) leveraging commercial diplomacy to open foreign markets for data centers, and (3) making equity investments throughout the AI supply chain--including a 10% stake in Intel and deals with Nvidia.

On a lighter note, [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/b4558688-f466-4a01-b8c2-c7cd3b1e0aa4?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) profiled Molly Cantillon, who built a "personal panopticon"--an all-seeing AI that manages her parking tickets, stock portfolio, alarm clock, and more using Claude Code.

[News Minimalist](https://newsletter.newsminimalist.com/p/renewables-overtake-fossil-fuels-in-eu-9-more-stories) reported hundreds of artists including Scarlett Johansson and Cate Blanchett launched an anti-AI campaign condemning unauthorized training on copyrighted work.

### 4. Electric Vehicles and Energy Transition

The report traced Biden's 2021 snub of Tesla--holding up GM as the leader--and Musk's resulting vendetta against Democrats.

> "As someone who laughed hysterically when GM came out with the EV Hummer--overcompensate much?--I had to eat crow here." -- [Core Memory](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29yZW1lbW9yeS5jb20vcC93ZS13ZW50LXRvLWRldHJvaXQtdG8tc2VlLWdtcy1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlLXdvbmRlcmxhbmQ_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRNE9URTRNRFFzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RnME5qUXlPU3dpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TkRNNE5ESTVMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpJd09UazJJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS5OaFJJVmRJbXYwU1JwVjA5Vk94NFBZVVYzMmpPOVExbU1waWl2bjhlSUdNIiwicCI6MTg0ODkxODA0LCJzIjozMjA5OTYsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg4NDY0MjksImV4cCI6MjA4NDQyMjQyOSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.YKnY2GQ6CeVYVy86RXRnpLdtWoShvIPvuAu7veZGvQo?)

GM is betting big on LMR (Lithium Manganese-Rich) batteries to compete with Chinese automakers, though the company just recorded a $7.1 billion loss tied to EV write-downs.

[News Minimalist](https://newsletter.newsminimalist.com/p/renewables-overtake-fossil-fuels-in-eu-9-more-stories) reported a major milestone: wind and solar surpassed fossil fuels in the EU's 2025 electricity mix for the first time, generating 841 terawatt-hours (30.1% of production).

### 5. Philosophy, Consciousness, and Deep Reading

**Coverage:** [Jeremy D Johnson from Mutations](https://jeremydjohnson.substack.com/p/reclaiming-time-for-deep-reading), [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/stein-network-centric-warfare-trust-mission-command-ooda), [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/john-boyd-99th-birthday-real-ooda-orientation-destruction-creation)

Jeremy D Johnson published an eloquent manifesto for slow reading, announcing a new course on Jean Gebser's philosophical opus *The Ever-Present Origin*:

> "These times call for us to turn towards meaning, not mechanism. We need to make the choice to reclaim time from relentless algorithmic capture." -- [Mutations](https://jeremydjohnson.substack.com/p/reclaiming-time-for-deep-reading)

Johnson described how Gebser's work centers on a new consciousness of time that transcends both clock-time and the "neoliberal capture of meditation." He positioned the "quiet renaissance" of para-academic reading communities as resistance to algorithmic capture.

Meanwhile, [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/john-boyd-99th-birthday-real-ooda-orientation-destruction-creation) celebrated what would have been John Boyd's 99th birthday with a deep dive into the OODA loop creator's actual philosophy--rejecting the "loop-speed-worship" in favor of "Orientation" as the decisive human advantage.

Tworek revealed he found it hard to do "high-risk, pioneering work" as OpenAI shifted toward "more conservative ways."

### 7. Culture, Books, and Lifestyle

**Coverage:** [Molly Young](https://mollyyoung.substack.com/p/so-you-think-you-can-read-x), [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/home-goods-guide-the-finale), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/0ccda6a3-c106-44f1-8ed9-f6c77479fc7b?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [Eliza Brooke](https://elizabrooke.substack.com/p/overcompensating-show-college-feelings)

[Molly Young](https://mollyyoung.substack.com/p/so-you-think-you-can-read-x) delivered book recommendations with characteristic wit, praising Iris Murdoch's *The Black Prince* ("People tend to start with The Sea, The Sea when embarking on HMS Murdoch but this is the better novel on all dimensions") and Akimitsu Takagi's locked-room mystery *The Tattoo Murder*, selected because the author "decided to become a mystery writer on the recommendation of a fortune teller."

[Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/home-goods-guide-the-finale) released Part Two of their home goods guide with philosophical musings on mortality and consumerism: "None of us can live forever in the sletter. Some day, we all die, and there's no reason we should look to that day with fear."

[The Free Press Weekend Press](https://substack.com/redirect/0ccda6a3-c106-44f1-8ed9-f6c77479fc7b?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) debated whether Brooklyn Beckham was right to publicly break up with his family, framing celebrity drama as a proxy for larger cultural debates about "going no contact" with parents.

### 8. Global News and Geopolitics

**Coverage:** [News Minimalist](https://newsletter.newsminimalist.com/p/eu-and-mercosur-sign-trade-deal-after-25-years-of-negotiatio), [News Minimalist](https://newsletter.newsminimalist.com/p/renewables-overtake-fossil-fuels-in-eu-9-more-stories), [Blocked and Reported](https://www.blockedandreported.org/p/episode-291-oh-canada-with-jonathan-0bd)

[News Minimalist](https://newsletter.newsminimalist.com/p/eu-and-mercosur-sign-trade-deal-after-25-years-of-negotiatio) provided concise coverage of major international developments:
- EU-Mercosur trade deal signed after 25 years of negotiations
- China's population declined for the fourth consecutive year with record-low birth rates
- World's first legally binding High Seas Treaty entered into force (83 nations ratified)
- Taiwan investing $250 billion in US semiconductor manufacturing
- Syria and SDF ceasefire agreement reached

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Trump as the Organizing Force**: Whether approvingly or critically, Trump dominated coverage across newsletters--his Greenland gambit, Davos speech, Board of Peace, AI-generated propaganda images, and immigration enforcement were inescapable.

**Tension Between Policy Goals and Human Costs**: Multiple newsletters grappled with supporting policy objectives while documenting painful execution. The Free Press ran both defenses of strict immigration policy and the deeply humanizing deportation story. Niall Ferguson supported acquiring Greenland while criticizing Trump's methods.

**AI Critique from Multiple Angles**: Brian Merchant critiqued Trump's AI policy as statist concentration of power. Artists launched anti-AI copyright campaigns. Jerry Tworek left OpenAI citing conservatism. The TGIF column mocked Trump's AI-generated propaganda as "slopaganda."

**Slow Down and Think**: Jeremy D Johnson's call to reclaim time for deep reading, The Whirl of ReOrientation's John Boyd celebration, and Molly Young's book recommendations all pushed against algorithmic speed in favor of deliberate engagement.
