## Major Topics and Stories

**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/7b7966b5-418b-4de3-b3a7-997cde5f3724?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

President Trump dramatically escalated his push to acquire Greenland, threatening significant economic consequences for European allies. The president demanded a deal for "complete and total purchase" of Greenland and announced 10 percent tariffs on imports from Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the UK, France, and Germany beginning February 1, rising to 25 percent by June 1.
