# Week 04 Tech-AI Newsletter Analysis (January 19-25, 2026)

## Overview

Week 04 brings a shift in focus from technical implementation to the philosophical implications of AI tooling. [Sam Schillace from Sunday Letters](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/the-hard-part-isnt-doing-the-work) explores the cognitive and organizational challenges emerging from agentic AI coding tools, while [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/) offers a cultural perspective through New Yorker reviews. The dominant theme is **attention saturation** in the age of AI agents—not whether AI can do the work, but how humans navigate the abundance it creates.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. The Maturation of Agentic AI Coding
**Coverage:** [Sam Schillace from Sunday Letters](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/the-hard-part-isnt-doing-the-work)

Sam Schillace, writing from direct experience building with AI coding agents, argues we're witnessing a critical inflection point similar to the early internet's evolution from rough experimentation to robust implementation. He draws a parallel to the dotcom era: "The browser was 1993, the dotcom crash was 2000, Writely was 2005 and the iPhone wasn't even until 2006!" The key insight is that transformative technologies require infrastructure, best practices, and time to mature.

> "It's taken a while to fix enough of those issues, and to understand how to make use of the increased capabilities. But now, we have agentic coding frameworks that are astoundingly good - it feels like AI is coming into focus, the way the internet did after the first few rough years." — [Sam Schillace](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/the-hard-part-isnt-doing-the-work)

Schillace notes that skepticism persists despite active communities using these tools successfully, echoing earlier resistance to browser-based applications: "It's like in the early days of Writely, when we had about a half million happy users, and people would still tell me that the browser could never be used to build a satisfying app."

### 2. The Attention Saturation Problem
**Coverage:** [Sam Schillace from Sunday Letters](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/the-hard-part-isnt-doing-the-work)

A surprising consequence of effective AI agents is not reduced workload but **attention bottlenecks**. Because starting a new coding task now takes "just a minute or so," practitioners saturate their capacity to review and guide work.

> "You will have as many things going on as you can pay attention to. Which means your co-workers will, too. This makes it hard to collaborate - everyone is busy all the time." — [Sam Schillace](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/the-hard-part-isnt-doing-the-work)

Schillace observes this mirrors historical patterns: humans don't optimize for leisure when efficiency improves, but for "ever richer and more complex lives." He suspects AI won't replace jobs but transform them, making workers potentially busier: "It won't replace jobs, it will change them, and we might well wind up being more busy, not less."

### 3. Taste and Judgment as Core Skills
**Coverage:** [Sam Schillace from Sunday Letters](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/the-hard-part-isnt-doing-the-work)

The title captures the week's central thesis: **"The hard part isn't doing the work now; it's choosing the work."** As execution becomes trivial, curation becomes critical.

> "Because it's so easy to start things now with these tools, you have to have good taste in what you start. It's not hard to do work now, it's hard to pick what work to do. I suspect this is a deep truth of the AI age - as agents get more powerful and cheaper, the actual mechanics of the work will matter less. What will matter is the taste and judgement of deciding what to do." — [Sam Schillace](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/the-hard-part-isnt-doing-the-work)

He offers a caloric analogy: just as food abundance made nutritional choice the critical skill, cognitive abundance makes strategic choice paramount. "As thinking gets cheaper, safer, and more accessible, perhaps the same will be true."

### 4. The "Why Not/What If" Dichotomy in Innovation
**Coverage:** [Sam Schillace from Sunday Letters](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/the-hard-part-isnt-doing-the-work)

Schillace revisits a framework from his Writely/Google Docs days: truly disruptive ideas trigger emotional discomfort, forcing people to either defend their worldview ("why not" stories explaining why it won't work) or update it ("what if" stories exploring implications). Big category changes produce polarized "I love it"/"I hate it" reactions with little middle ground.

He applies this to current agentic coding skepticism: "There are still lots of people who strongly believe it won't work, it's impossible to build code that way, and so on. And then..I spend time in communities of people who are very successfully using these tools, all day long (me included)."

### 5. "Code Goes First" as Bellwether
**Coverage:** [Sam Schillace from Sunday Letters](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/the-hard-part-isnt-doing-the-work)

Schillace argues programming serves as an early indicator for AI's broader trajectory: "The coding world is showing how the AI world will likely unfold for other uses and professions. 'Code goes first' because it's easier for the models to deal with and the programming community (well, some of it, anyway) are already primed to understand and use it."

He demonstrates cross-domain application by building an entire website ([Amplifier Stories](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/the-hard-part-isnt-doing-the-work)) "in just a few minutes this week" using coding agents, emphasizing: "Don't be lulled into thinking 'that's all there is' with AI. It's still moving. The coding communities are absolutely on fire at the moment."

### 6. Cultural Perspective: Theater and Full-Frontal Nudity Trends
**Coverage:** [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/)

While tangential to core tech-AI discussion, [Sam Circle's](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/) review of Under the Radar and other NYC theater festivals reveals an interesting cultural pattern: widespread use of full-frontal nudity across experimental performances. Circle notes: "All these shows, individually, do good work justifying their nudity in all sorts of various ways, but as a trend it's getting wearying – and also just kinda weird – fast!"

This observation about trend saturation in cultural production mirrors Schillace's attention saturation thesis—when a technique becomes ubiquitous, individual works lose distinctiveness even when executed well.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Paradox of Abundance
Both newsletters engage with surplus: [Schillace](https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/the-hard-part-isnt-doing-the-work) with computational work capacity, [Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-7125/) with theatrical nudity. The pattern suggests that when constraints disappear (cost of coding, taboos around bodies), the challenge shifts from production to differentiation and curation.

### Maturation Requires Time and Infrastructure
Schillace's internet evolution analogy underscores that transformative technologies don't arrive fully formed. The gap between initial capability (GPT-3/4 era) and robust implementation (current agentic frameworks) parallels the gap between early browsers and mature web applications. Patience and iteration matter.

### Skepticism as Emotional Response
The "why not/what if" framework reframes resistance to AI not as rational cost-benefit analysis but as worldview defense. This suggests productive dialogue requires addressing emotional discomfort, not just presenting evidence.
