## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Historic Winter Storm Approaching New England

**Coverage:** [OpenSnow - Quiet Week Ahead](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42422?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026), [OpenSnow - Light Snow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42466?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026), [OpenSnow - Model Trends](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42496?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026), [OpenSnow - Tracking the Storm](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42517?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026), [OpenSnow - Weekend Update](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42545?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

The week began with forecasts of a quiet period, but by mid-week meteorological models converged on a significant winter storm developing over the Southern Rockies and tracking toward New England. Dr. Jay Cordeira's daily updates tracked the storm's evolution with increasing precision.

> "It's currently 4:15AM, -30F on top of Mt. Washington, with a windchill of -80F. You read that right." — [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42545?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

Key forecast details:
- **Snow totals:** 12-18+ inches expected across southern and central New England
- **Peak snowfall rates:** 3-4 inches per hour predicted for Sunday afternoon/evening
- **Highest accumulations:** Berkshires, southern Green Mountains, and Worcester Hills region expected to see 18+ inches
- **Snow-to-liquid ratios:** Unusually fluffy snow with ratios of 15:1 to 20:1

The storm developed from a "cutoff low" west of Baja California that ejected eastward, syncing with Arctic high pressure to create a large-scale winter system.

### 2. Extreme Cold Weather and Resort Impacts

**Coverage:** [OpenSnow - Model Trends](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42496?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026), [OpenSnow - Weekend Update](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42545?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

Before the snow arrived, extreme cold gripped New England. Multiple ski resorts implemented "cold holds" and limited operations due to dangerous conditions.

> "I actually hope that the forecast is wrong and that we see some walk-back/moderation over the next several days. The latest forecast for the mountains (e.g., Killington and Jay Peak) is for windchill temperatures between -55F and -25F." — [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42422?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

The NWS issued an "extreme cold watch" for northern New England, and Jay Peak postponed planned activities. Daytime highs remained below 0F with windchills reaching -40F or lower across the region.

### 3. Hurricane Hunters and Weather Reconnaissance

**Coverage:** [OpenSnow - Model Trends](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42496?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

An interesting behind-the-scenes detail emerged: the Air Force 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron ("Hurricane Hunters") flew reconnaissance missions into the developing storm system over the Pacific.

> "They dropped 'dropsondes' -- the same as weather balloons without the balloon, but with parachutes -- to collect information for the models. These observations went into the 00Z model suite last night... I get to help plan these flights as part of my day job." — [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42496?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)
