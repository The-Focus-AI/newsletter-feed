Meteorologist Jay Cordeira outlined a relatively quiet week ahead for New England skiing, with two modest snow events expected. Light snow across the North Country would provide the best chances for fresh tracks on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, with accumulations of 1-3 inches across the Green and White Mountains during each event.

The first system would move through Monday afternoon with light snow showers continuing into Monday night. A second similar round was forecast for Wednesday night into Thursday morning.

### 2. Extreme Cold Warning for Weekend of January 24-26
**Coverage:** [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42422?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

The most significant weather story was not about snow but about an approaching Arctic blast that could bring dangerous cold to the region. The forecast called for windchill temperatures between -55F and -25F on Friday through Monday (January 24-26), with daytime highs and overnight lows potentially below zero.

> "The latest forecast for the mountains (e.g., Killington and Jay Peak below) is for windchill temperatures between –55F and –25F on Friday (24 Jan) through Monday (26 Jan). If this forecast verifies, we'll likely see a couple resorts take actions around potential cold exposure." — [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42422?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

The meteorologist expressed hope that the forecast would moderate, noting that skiing in such conditions would be the "opposite" of fun and could require resort closures or operational adjustments for safety.

### 3. Potential Mid-Atlantic Storm Tracking South of New England
**Coverage:** [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42422?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

The extended forecast discussion highlighted a developing winter storm for Sunday, January 25, that appeared likely to track over the Mid-Atlantic rather than New England. Multiple ensemble models, including the ECMWF AI ensemble and GFS ensemble, were showing convergence on a solution that would keep the storm south of New England, where the Arctic high pressure system would block a northward track.

The analysis noted that ensemble probabilities for significant snowfall in New England remained fairly low, though the meteorologist emphasized the need to watch for any northward trend shifts that could bring the storm closer to the region.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

With only one newsletter represented in Week 04's personal category, cross-newsletter patterns could not be identified. The [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42422?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026) forecast focused on specialized regional ski weather, providing technical meteorological analysis that balanced short-term powder opportunities against longer-term safety concerns related to extreme cold.

The report demonstrated a commitment to candid forecasting, with the meteorologist explicitly stating his hope that the extreme cold forecast would not verify and acknowledging the potential operational impacts on ski resorts.
