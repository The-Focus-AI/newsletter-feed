# Week 03 Politics Newsletter Analysis
## January 12-17, 2026

---

## Overview

This was a week of institutional crisis, military threats, and political realignment. The unprecedented criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell dominated financial news, drawing bipartisan condemnation as a threat to central bank independence. Simultaneously, the Trump administration engaged in aggressive foreign policy moves across three continents: military intervention in Venezuela, threatened strikes on Iran during its worst unrest since 1979, and continued pressure to acquire Greenland from Denmark.

The week culminated with new WSJ polling showing most Americans believe Trump is "going too far," even as his base remains steadfast. Meanwhile, the Minneapolis ICE shooting of Renee Nicole Good became a flashpoint, with Joe Rogan's criticism marking what some observers called a potential "watershed moment" in right-wing media coverage of immigration enforcement.

## 1. Trump vs. The Federal Reserve: The Powell Investigation

**The biggest political story of the week** was the unprecedented criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which drew bipartisan condemnation and raised serious questions about central bank independence.

### The Investigation

**Bloomberg** broke the news that the Justice Department had issued subpoenas to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as part of a criminal inquiry into the central bank's interest rate decisions. The investigation appears focused on whether the Fed deliberately kept rates higher to harm Trump politically.

From Bloomberg's January 12 evening briefing:
> "The Justice Department issued subpoenas to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as part of a criminal inquiry into the central bank's interest rate decisions, a largely unprecedented development that former Fed chairs said threatens the economy and should be 'abhorrent' to Americans."

### Bipartisan Condemnation

The investigation drew immediate and fierce criticism from across the political spectrum. **Bloomberg** reported that five former Fed chairs issued a joint statement:

> "All five living former Fed chairs released a joint statement condemning the probe as an 'unwarranted, unprecedented attack' on the central bank's independence."

**Emma Tucker's WSJ "The 10-Point"** (January 12) provided additional context:
> "The probe comes as the Fed is already under pressure from a potential trade war that administration officials have said would likely fuel inflation. Trump's tariffs have driven some firms to raise prices and cut jobs. Powell said in December that the Fed was watching the developments closely."

### The Fed Chair Contest

By January 16, **WSJ** reported the investigation was complicating Trump's search for Powell's replacement:
> "The criminal probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is creating new obstacles on Capitol Hill and raising hard questions about whether any nominee Trump chooses to replace him can be seen as independent."

**Semafor DC** (January 16) noted that despite the controversy, Fed officials rallied behind Powell:
> "Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned eroded central bank independence could cause inflation to 'come roaring back'; Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson called Powell 'very effective.'"

### Economic Implications

**Bloomberg** (January 14) explored how the probe could backfire on Trump:
> "The much-criticized criminal inquiry could leave Powell at the central bank for longer while making interest rate cuts less likely."

**Bloomberg Weekend** (January 17) offered a glimmer of hope for institutional checks:
> "Subpoenas against the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell looked like a bombshell, but the backlash from markets, courts and the Senate suggests Trump 2.0 is not all-powerful after all."

## 2. Iran in Crisis: Protests, Bank Collapse, and Communication Blackout

### The Unfolding Crisis

**Amir Ahmadi Arian** writing for **New York Review Books** (January 13, "Blackout in Iran") provided the most detailed and personal account of the situation in Iran:

> "For the past three weeks, the Islamic Republic has been facing its most existential challenge since its founding in 1979. Widespread protests have left more than 2,100 people dead, according to opposition sources, and tens of thousands injured."

Arian, who has family in Tehran, described the communication difficulties:
> "I have heard from them only sporadically; the near-total Internet and cellphone blackout that the regime has imposed has made communication almost impossible, even between people who live in the same city."

### The Bank Collapse

**Bloomberg** (January 12, "Fed Up") reported on the economic catalyst:
> "Protests are raging across Iran after the collapse of Ayandeh Bank, which wiped out the savings of some 17 million people... The demonstrations, now in their 21st day, mark the most significant popular unrest since the mass protests of 2019 and 2022, testing the capacity of the security services to contain the turmoil."

### The Massacre

**Emma Tucker's WSJ "The 10-Point"** (January 16, "Inside the 24 Hours That Bloodied Iran") provided a devastating account:
> "When authorities in Iran shut down the internet on Jan. 8, they didn't just block the world out; they created a vacuum for an unprecedented wave of state violence... one human-rights group leader describes as a 'massacre.'"

### The US Response

**Semafor Flagship** (January 16) reported that the immediate risk of a US strike had waned:
> "Officials advised US President Donald Trump that an attack would be unlikely to topple the government... while Israel and Arab governments pressed him not to follow through on his threat of dire consequences."

**WSJ** (January 17) confirmed that Trump decided against military action:
> "Senior U.S. military officials were prepared to strike Iran on Wednesday, but President Trump decided against the move after regional allies warned him that a bombing campaign might lead to a wider conflict."

**Amir Ahmadi Arian** in NYRB offered a warning about US intervention:
> "Even if the current uprising does end the regime, there is a possibility, even a likelihood, that what follows will be catastrophic in its own way... Any new government that came to power with even indirect American assistance might become a client state of the US and, by extension, of Israel."

## 3. The Fall of Tim Walz and Minneapolis Tinderbox

### The ICE Shooting

**Bloomberg** (January 12, "Fed Up") reported on the incident that accelerated Walz's downfall:
> "Walz's political career, already weakened by his failed vice-presidential bid and the welfare fraud scandal, suffered what may be a fatal blow after ICE agents shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 34-year-old mother of three, during a raid in Minneapolis."

### The Welfare Fraud Scandal

**Darel E. Paul** writing for **Compact Magazine** (January 12, "The Death of 'Minnesota Nice'") provided the most comprehensive analysis of Tim Walz's political collapse:

> "For decades, Minnesota Nice served as more than just a cultural stereotype. It was a political achievement... But sometime around 2020, Minnesota Nice died."

Paul detailed the welfare fraud scandal:
> "The scale of the fraud revealed in the Feeding Our Future case -- nearly $300 million stolen from federal child nutrition programs -- shocked even the most cynical observers. But what proved more damaging to Walz wasn't the fraud itself. It was the revelation that his administration had been warned repeatedly about the scheme and did nothing."

### Minneapolis as Tinderbox

**WSJ** (January 17) described the escalating situation:
> "Minneapolis has become a tinderbox as the Trump administration's huge immigration operation has collided with enormous pushback from residents."

**Semafor DC** (January 16) reported on Trump's threat:
> "President Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in order to use US troops to quell protests in Minnesota after an ICE officer killed a woman in Minneapolis."

### The Rogan Moment

**WSJ** (January 17) noted a potentially significant shift:
> "Joe Rogan expressed concerns about the killing of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis by an ICE agent, a criticism that some saw as a watershed moment."

### Democrats' Dilemma

**Semafor DC** (January 16) reported on Democrats' limited options:
> "'It's going to be quite a fight. Because what they are doing is so unacceptable that I think there are going to be a lot of people who are going to be reluctant to fund it at all,' said Sen. Angus King, I-Maine."

---

## 4. Venezuela: A New Form of American Imperialism?

### The Maduro Capture

**Slavoj Zizek** (January 14, "DONALD VLADIMIROVICH TRUMP'S 'LIMITED MILITARY OPERATION' IN VENEZUELA") provided the most provocative analysis of the US intervention:

> "While our media are full of details about how the capture of Maduro and his wife was organized, one should focus on how strange this act is: Venezuela is now de facto occupied while the same government as before runs things."

Zizek quoted Trump directly:
> "Trump said on January 3, 2026, that the US is 'going to run' Venezuela indefinitely: 'We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,' and, even more directly, that he considers himself 'in charge of Venezuela.'"

### The Oil Angle

**Semafor Flagship** (January 16) reported on Venezuela's response to US pressure:
> "Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodriguez said she would reform the country's hydrocarbon laws to ease foreign investment, in a bid to boost its moribund oil industry."

**WSJ** (January 17) noted the shipping impact:
> "The increase in freight rates for the largest shipping tankers since the arrest of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro [was] 90%... It is a boom time for Greek shipowners as oil traders rush to profit from the reopening of Venezuela's oil market."

### The Machado Question

**Semafor DC** (January 16) reported on the opposition leader's White House visit:
> "Maria Corina Machado's meeting with Trump is unlikely to sway the US president in her favor, even after the Venezuelan opposition leader said she 'presented' him with her Nobel Peace prize. Trump (who plans to keep the medal) says he's been working well with Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodriguez."

### Zizek's Ukraine Parallel

**Zizek** drew a pointed comparison:
> "Remember the scandalous Oval Office confrontation with Zelensky, where Trump and Vance demanded that Zelensky express his gratitude for US help to Ukraine and pay for it by opening natural resources to US companies. So, again, as in the case of Ukraine, you liberate a country to enslave it economically."

### Congress Pushes Back -- Then Folds

**Bloomberg Weekend** (January 17) noted:
> "Five Republicans had joined Democrats to advance legislation opposing further US military action in Venezuela. Less than 48 hours later, the effort collapsed after a barrage of calls from Donald Trump to the GOP defectors."

---

## 5. Greenland: Trump's Territorial Ambitions

### European Response

**Bloomberg** (January 14, "China center stage") reported on European military deployments:

> "Germany will take the lead among European nations sending military personnel to Greenland after Denmark said its meeting with aides to Trump, who appears intent on taking its territory, revealed a 'fundamental disagreement' remains."

**WSJ** (January 16) described the deployment:
> "America's closest allies are using their troops to deter a U.S. invasion of Greenland in a small yet unprecedented buildup."

### Congressional Support for Denmark

**Semafor DC** (January 16) reported on bipartisan pushback:
> "A group including Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., is in Denmark to talk up US relations with the NATO ally; Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, will give a speech at the University of Copenhagen... saying Trump's rhetoric 'undermines the NATO Alliance at a time when our adversaries seek to benefit from division.'"

### New Tariff Threats

**WSJ** (January 17) reported:
> "Trump threatened to impose tariffs on countries that oppose his efforts to take control of Greenland."

### The FOMO Effect

**Bloomberg** quoted Neil Thomas of the Asia Society Policy Institute:
> "Trump is triggering diplomatic FOMO across the Western world. His approach leaves leaders eager to engage Xi so they aren't sidelined by US-China maneuvering."

---

## 6. Trump's Approval and the "Going Too Far" Problem

### New Polling

**WSJ** (January 17, "Voters Are Unhappy With Trump's Economy") revealed:
> "Donald Trump is pushing boundaries at home and abroad this month, threatening to upend governments in Latin America, take military action in Iran and seize control of Greenland. Some officials have privately nicknamed him 'President of the World.' But... A new WSJ poll shows that most U.S. voters think he's going too far -- though members of the MAGA base remain steadfast in their support."

### Operating Without Constraints

**Washington Post** (via Semafor DC, January 16) summarized the week:
> "From the investigation into Jerome Powell to his efforts to acquire Greenland, the past week has underscored how Trump operates 'unencumbered by tradition, optics or concerns about the separation of powers.'"

### Political Recalibration

**Axios** (via Semafor DC, January 16) reported internal concerns:
> "Some advisers to President Trump are discussing 'recalibrating' the White House's approach to immigration enforcement after private GOP polling showed waning support for the policies."

---

## 7. AI and Technology: Grok, Voice Cloning, and Claude

### The Grok Deepfake Scandal

**Casey Newton** in **Platformer** (January 13, "Grok Gets Blocked") provided detailed coverage:

> "The United Kingdom, Indonesia, and Malaysia have blocked access to Grok, Elon Musk's AI chatbot, after the service was used to generate explicit deepfake images of political figures including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto."

Newton reported on the political implications:
> "The Grok crisis represents a watershed moment for AI regulation. For the first time, a major world power has banned an AI service not for what it might do, but for what it has already done."

### Voice Cloning Technology

**Casey Newton** (January 14, "What I Learned While Cloning My Own Voice") explored the implications:

> "After spending a week with ElevenLabs' voice cloning technology, I'm both impressed and alarmed. The technology is now good enough that my own family members couldn't reliably distinguish the clone from my actual voice."

### Claude Cowork Launch

**Simon Willison** (January 13, "First Impressions of Claude Cowork") reviewed Anthropic's new collaborative AI tool:

> "Claude Cowork represents something genuinely new: an AI that can work alongside you in a shared workspace, with persistent context and the ability to take actions across your tools. It's not just a chatbot; it's something closer to a digital colleague."

---

## 8. NYC Politics: Zohran Mamdani's Mayoral Victory

**Nate Silver** in the **Silver Bulletin** (January 12, "Zohran's High-Risk, High-Reward Strategy") analyzed the NYC mayoral race:

> "Mamdani's victory in the Democratic primary -- and his subsequent general election win -- represents a genuine realignment in New York City politics. His coalition combined progressive activists, working-class immigrants, and younger voters in a way that previous progressive candidates failed to achieve."

Silver noted the strategic innovation:
> "Unlike previous progressive candidates who ran primarily on ideology, Mamdani built a coalition based on concrete material interests. His housing platform, which promised aggressive rent stabilization and new public housing construction, spoke directly to the economic anxieties of New Yorkers across the ideological spectrum."

---

## 9. Family Policy and Social Issues

### The Heritage Foundation Report

**Brad Wilcox** writing for **Compact Magazine** (January 13, "The New Right Is More Right Than Wrong on Family Policy") analyzed demographic trends:

> "The Heritage Foundation's new report on family formation deserves serious engagement from across the political spectrum. Its central finding -- that the US fertility rate has fallen to 1.62, well below the replacement rate of 2.1 -- represents a genuine crisis."

### The War on Black Fathers

**Delano Squires** writing for **Compact Magazine** (January 16, "The War on Black Fathers") critiqued Christina Cross's book on racial inequality:

> "Cross calls debates over family structure 'the great distracter.' Indeed, she suggests that focusing on racial inequality is a better use of political and social capital than promoting the two-parent ideal."

Squires argued:
> "Whether black children benefit as much from being raised in a two-parent home as their white peers is irrelevant. What matters is whether data proves that one family structure is consistently linked to better outcomes than any other. On every measure, black children benefit from being raised by a father and mother."

### Birthright Citizenship Debate

**Ilan Wurman** writing for **Compact Magazine** (January 14, "The True History of Birthright Citizenship") provided a legal analysis:

> "The Fourteenth Amendment's citizenship clause has been misunderstood for generations. The phrase 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof' was not mere surplusage; it had specific meaning to its drafters."

---

## 10. Polling Analysis: The 2025 Report Card

**Nate Silver** in the **Silver Bulletin** (January 14, "Actually, Sometimes Polls Underestimate Democrats") analyzed polling accuracy:

> "The average polling error in 2025 was 7.1 points... the average error across all polls in our database since 1998 is only 5.9 points."

Silver provided key context:
> "But perhaps the direction of last year's bias could be construed as somewhat of a silver lining for pollsters. It's easy to imagine people being more upset with the 2025 polls if they once again underestimated Democrats. Instead, the polls were too bullish on Republicans, on average."

On the Trump factor:
> "When Trump is on the ballot -- 2016, 2020, 2024 -- we underestimate[d] him to varying degrees. In 2018 and 2022, polls [did] a pretty decent job of telling us [what was] going to happen with the congressional races. The hypothesis is that there's something unique to Trump being on the ballot."

---

## 11. Global Trade Realignment

### US-Taiwan Deal

**Semafor Flagship** (January 16) reported on a major trade agreement:
> "The US and Taiwan finalized a trade deal that will see Washington cap tariffs on Taiwanese imports, a boost to Taipei's crucial semiconductor sector, in return for a $250 billion investment to expand chipmaking on American soil."

### Countries Diversifying Away from US

**Semafor Flagship** (January 16) noted the broader trend:
> "Kenya, subject to a 10% US levy, signed a preliminary agreement with China that would give 98% of its exports duty-free access to the Chinese market... Meanwhile, the prime minister of Canada -- which sends three-quarters of its exports to the US -- is in Beijing seeking to boost bilateral trade."

### World Leaders Turn to China

**Bloomberg** (January 14, "China center stage") noted the geopolitical shift:
> "China is making a move toward center stage amid the growing chaos of US foreign and economic policy under Donald Trump. As the 79-year-old president threatens new tariffs or military attack on friend and foe alike, President Xi Jinping is welcoming a procession of leaders looking to mend fences with the world's other major economy."

---

## 12. European Political Fragmentation

### UK Conservatives in Freefall

**Semafor Flagship** (January 16) reported:
> "A prominent Conservative defected to Britain's upstart Reform UK party, the most significant sign of fracturing in one of the world's oldest and most consistently successful political parties... The party was badly beaten in 2024, is facing a growing challenge from the anti-immigrant Reform, and may be in terminal decline."

### Germany's Economic Glimmer

**Semafor Flagship** (January 16) noted:
> "Germany's economy grew 0.2% last year, the first time it has shown annual growth since 2022... Chancellor Friedrich Merz loosened debt laws this year, freeing up cash to boost investment in infrastructure and defense."

## Surprising Insights

1. **Joe Rogan's criticism of ICE**: His concerns about the Renee Good killing "was seen as a watershed moment" -- potentially the first crack in right-wing media solidarity on immigration enforcement.

2. **The 2025 polling reversal**: After three presidential cycles underestimating Trump, polls in 2025 actually overestimated Republicans by 6.1 points on average.

3. **The Haiti parallel**: Zizek's comparison of Venezuela's oil to Haiti's payment for freedom in 1825 provides historical depth to current events.

4. **The Grok country bans**: Three major nations banning an AI service for actual harms rather than hypothetical ones marks a new phase in AI governance.

5. **World leaders' "FOMO"**: The framing of diplomatic visits to China as driven by "fear of missing out" on US-China deals.

6. **"President of the World"**: WSJ reporting that some officials have privately nicknamed Trump this way.

7. **Bloomberg Weekend's institutional optimism**: The argument that "the backlash from markets, courts and the Senate suggests Trump 2.0 is not all-powerful after all" -- a rare positive note on checks and balances.

8. **Congress folds in 48 hours**: Five Republican senators joined Democrats opposing Venezuela action, then reversed after Trump phone calls -- illustrating the limits of Congressional resistance.
