## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. DOJ Investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell

**Coverage:** [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/sKiMyc4iHA?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/uk7eZ-5Ye66UyYOj9U1e7razgCQG34U1SZLX4IM97VL75FeaEAXDpbcXs-zqor3Eu0-X1zR4g1os6_hQpxM5938dR_BJivb8k5gcqz9C1oh5W73AN3NwuSZhlv34O2vR5NktTAge3X8AYumriehN3LyczoyHSvxy0GPRLr1aqMM68J9mtiwzMtdltCljHGRGC8E_GFTNLJW4hhvOLjlVSehrBDO7v3DXUi5p_tCzahCm_Xxxy9OJCflh-JdG19VhA9T-GPiEt3hY1vRDRK2Bn61kgFfnkz9nzYQLxoevO85EYjRgoBSb1xinnJoUsoobc9-M628P93wDqjgd1c3T4Jroeat294HDGaSpgXYN-EzIFAk7JjzXhjVUcg/bBpZ9kJSdLYCB6V4DcNbQEGgaiZg5bua/16), The Atlantic Daily

The week's most consequential story was the Justice Department opening a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell over his testimony regarding the Fed headquarters renovation project - now estimated to be $700 million over budget. Powell responded with an unprecedented video statement directly linking the probe to political pressure over interest rates.

> "This unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president." — Jerome Powell, via The Atlantic Daily

[Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/sKiMyc4iHA?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported that Republican Senator Thom Tillis vowed to "withhold votes from any Fed pick until this legal matter is fully resolved." [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/uk7eZ-5Ye66UyYOj9U1e7razgCQG34U1SZLX4IM97VL75FeaEAXDpbcXs-zqor3Eu0-X1zR4g1os6_hQpxM5938dR_BJivb8k5gcqz9C1oh5W73AN3NwuSZhlv34O2vR5NktTAge3X8AYumriehN3LyczoyHSvxy0GPRLr1aqMM68J9mtiwzMtdltCljHGRGC8E_GFTNLJW4hhvOLjlVSehrBDO7v3DXUi5p_tCzahCm_Xxxy9OJCflh-JdG19VhA9T-GPiEt3hY1vRDRK2Bn61kgFfnkz9nzYQLxoevO85EYjRgoBSb1xinnJoUsoobc9-M628P93wDqjgd1c3T4Jroeat294HDGaSpgXYN-EzIFAk7JjzXhjVUcg/bBpZ9kJSdLYCB6V4DcNbQEGgaiZg5bua/16) revealed that Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte was the "instigator" behind the subpoenas.

The Atlantic Daily noted the irony: "The administration that demolished the White House's East Wing without congressional approval is now cracking down on construction oversight." Former Fed chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Alan Greenspan released a joint statement warning this "is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions."

### 2. Iran's Deadly Crackdown on Protesters

**Coverage:** [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/irans-tiananmen-square), [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/sKiMyc4iHA?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39)

The Iranian regime's violent suppression of protests dominated foreign policy coverage. [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/irans-tiananmen-square) provided the most extensive and alarming coverage, citing Iran International's report that at least 12,000 people were killed - which would exceed estimates of the Tiananmen Square death toll.

> "In the largest killing in Iran's contemporary history - carried out largely over two consecutive nights, Thursday and Friday, January 8 and 9 - at least 12,000 people were killed... This killing was fully organized, not the result of 'sporadic' and 'unplanned' clashes." — Iran International, via [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/irans-tiananmen-square)

[The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/irans-tiananmen-square) also excerpted Iranian state propaganda from Press TV, which blamed "Mossad-CIA sleeper cells" for the violence and described protesters as "terrorists trained to create mayhem."

[Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/sKiMyc4iHA?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported Trump is weighing military options and was briefed by top officials, while Senator Rand Paul cautioned that "bombing is not the answer" and could cause Iranians to "rally around their own flag."

[Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39) examined the broader strategic questions with articles on "The Trouble With Regime Change" by Richard Haass and "Iran and the Limits of American Power" by Andrew P. Miller, arguing that a U.S. military strike could paradoxically prop up the regime.

### 3. Minneapolis ICE Shooting and Domestic Tensions

**Coverage:** [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637), [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/zohrans-high-risk-high-reward-strategy), [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/uk7eZ-5Ye66UyYOj9U1e7razgCQG34U1SZLX4IM97VL75FeaEAXDpbcXs-zqor3Eu0-X1zR4g1os6_hQpxM5938dR_BJivb8k5gcqz9C1oh5W73AN3NwuSZhlv34O2vR5NktTAge3X8AYumriehN3LyczoyHSvxy0GPRLr1aqMM68J9mtiwzMtdltCljHGRGC8E_GFTNLJW4hhvOLjlVSehrBDO7v3DXUi5p_tCzahCm_Xxxy9OJCflh-JdG19VhA9T-GPiEt3hY1vRDRK2Bn61kgFfnkz9nzYQLxoevO85EYjRgoBSb1xinnJoUsoobc9-M628P93wDqjgd1c3T4Jroeat294HDGaSpgXYN-EzIFAk7JjzXhjVUcg/bBpZ9kJSdLYCB6V4DcNbQEGgaiZg5bua/16), Emma Tucker WSJ, The Atlantic Daily

The killing of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis sparked massive protests and became a flashpoint in immigration debates. [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/uk7eZ-5Ye66UyYOj9U1e7razgCQG34U1SZLX4IM97VL75FeaEAXDpbcXs-zqor3Eu0-X1zR4g1os6_hQpxM5938dR_BJivb8k5gcqz9C1oh5W73AN3NwuSZhlv34O2vR5NktTAge3X8AYumriehN3LyczoyHSvxy0GPRLr1aqMM68J9mtiwzMtdltCljHGRGC8E_GFTNLJW4hhvOLjlVSehrBDO7v3DXUi5p_tCzahCm_Xxxy9OJCflh-JdG19VhA9T-GPiEt3hY1vRDRK2Bn61kgFfnkz9nzYQLxoevO85EYjRgoBSb1xinnJoUsoobc9-M628P93wDqjgd1c3T4Jroeat294HDGaSpgXYN-EzIFAk7JjzXhjVUcg/bBpZ9kJSdLYCB6V4DcNbQEGgaiZg5bua/16) reported thousands marched while DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced "hundreds more" officers would be deployed.

[Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/zohrans-high-risk-high-reward-strategy) offered a more measured take from Nate Silver:

> "I've been struggling with whether to write anything about the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis last week. I generally find this type of story difficult to cover... The bottom line is that while there were a lot of 'bad choices' made, this woman shouldn't have wound up dead." — [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/zohrans-high-risk-high-reward-strategy)

The Atlantic Daily reported that twelve people were arrested during continued protests, with federal officers using tear gas and percussion grenades. Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to quell unrest over federal immigration enforcement.

### 4. Tim Walz's Political Collapse and the Minnesota Fraud Scandal

**Coverage:** [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637)

[Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) provided the most comprehensive analysis of Governor Tim Walz's surprising political downfall, connecting it to a welfare fraud scandal that has cost at least $1 billion - with speculation it could reach $9 billion.

> "Over the last seventeen months Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has lived the myth of Icarus... Yet on January 5, 2026, Walz unexpectedly dropped out of the governor's race and presumably out of electoral politics altogether." — Darel E. Paul, [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637)

The article traces how the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme exploited the NGO-industrial complex, with monthly payments to the organization exploding from $61,000 in 2018 to $32 million in April 2021. [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) argues that Walz's downfall illustrates how his adoption of Trumpian political tactics ultimately backfired:

> "Tim Walz has also become a highly partisan ideologue... He called Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers 'Donald Trump's modern-day Gestapo,' Elon Musk a 'South African nepo baby,' and Congressional Republicans a 'merry band of dipshits.'" — [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637)

### 5. Greenland and Trump's Territorial Ambitions

**Coverage:** [Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39), [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/uk7eZ-5Ye66UyYOj9U1e7razgCQG34U1SZLX4IM97VL75FeaEAXDpbcXs-zqor3Eu0-X1zR4g1os6_hQpxM5938dR_BJivb8k5gcqz9C1oh5W73AN3NwuSZhlv34O2vR5NktTAge3X8AYumriehN3LyczoyHSvxy0GPRLr1aqMM68J9mtiwzMtdltCljHGRGC8E_GFTNLJW4hhvOLjlVSehrBDO7v3DXUi5p_tCzahCm_Xxxy9OJCflh-JdG19VhA9T-GPiEt3hY1vRDRK2Bn61kgFfnkz9nzYQLxoevO85EYjRgoBSb1xinnJoUsoobc9-M628P93wDqjgd1c3T4Jroeat294HDGaSpgXYN-EzIFAk7JjzXhjVUcg/bBpZ9kJSdLYCB6V4DcNbQEGgaiZg5bua/16), Emma Tucker WSJ, The Atlantic Daily

Trump's push to acquire Greenland continued to generate international friction. [Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39) featured Jeremy Shapiro's piece "How Greenland Falls: Imagining a Bloodless Trump Takeover."

[Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/uk7eZ-5Ye66UyYOj9U1e7razgCQG34U1SZLX4IM97VL75FeaEAXDpbcXs-zqor3Eu0-X1zR4g1os6_hQpxM5938dR_BJivb8k5gcqz9C1oh5W73AN3NwuSZhlv34O2vR5NktTAge3X8AYumriehN3LyczoyHSvxy0GPRLr1aqMM68J9mtiwzMtdltCljHGRGC8E_GFTNLJW4hhvOLjlVSehrBDO7v3DXUi5p_tCzahCm_Xxxy9OJCflh-JdG19VhA9T-GPiEt3hY1vRDRK2Bn61kgFfnkz9nzYQLxoevO85EYjRgoBSb1xinnJoUsoobc9-M628P93wDqjgd1c3T4Jroeat294HDGaSpgXYN-EzIFAk7JjzXhjVUcg/bBpZ9kJSdLYCB6V4DcNbQEGgaiZg5bua/16) reported that UK and Germany-led European countries are discussing plans for a military presence in Greenland to "both appease Trump and show the continent is committed to Arctic security." Emma Tucker's WSJ newsletter noted Trump threatened to impose tariffs on countries that oppose U.S. control of Greenland. The Atlantic Daily highlighted the "sacrifice of the Danes" - Denmark's significant contributions to NATO missions including Afghanistan.

### 6. Venezuela Post-Maduro: Oil and Power Politics

**Coverage:** [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/sKiMyc4iHA?email=wschenk@gmail.com), Emma Tucker WSJ, The Atlantic Daily

Following the capture of Nicolas Maduro, the Trump administration is navigating complex oil politics. [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/sKiMyc4iHA?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported that Trump declared a national emergency to prevent seizure of Venezuelan oil revenue after top oil executives signaled reluctance to invest. Trump also expressed displeasure with ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods and said he's "inclined" to keep Exxon out of investments there.

Emma Tucker's WSJ noted that Venezuela's Delcy Rodriguez - "a pariah during Trump's first term" - is now the U.S.'s primary partner in Venezuela, with CIA Director John Ratcliffe meeting her in Caracas.

### 7. U.S.-China Economic Security and Supply Chains

**Coverage:** [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-china-commissions-report)

[ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-china-commissions-report) provided deep analysis of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission's annual report, featuring commissioners Mike Kuiken and Leland Miller discussing supply chain vulnerabilities and the need for a new economic statecraft agency.

> "Supply chains are boring. If you had brought us on ChinaTalk a year ago and said, 'Let's talk supply chains,' it would have been a different conversation... The way to elevate supply chain resilience - a top-tier priority - is to make it a core pillar of a national economic security strategy." — Leland Miller, [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-china-commissions-report)

The commissioners raised alarm about pharmaceutical supply chain vulnerabilities: "China doesn't ship many finished drugs to the U.S., but it dominates the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) behind medications... China may control U.S. access to insulin, heparin, and antibiotics for both civilians and troops."

### 8. NYC Politics: Mayor Zohran Mamdani's Governing Coalition

**Coverage:** [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/zohrans-high-risk-high-reward-strategy)

[Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/zohrans-high-risk-high-reward-strategy) analyzed the governing challenges facing New York City's new democratic socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani, who was sworn in by Bernie Sanders.

> "I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist... To those who insist that the era of big government is over, hear me when I say this: No longer will City Hall hesitate to use its power to improve New Yorkers' lives." — Mayor Zohran Mamdani, via [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/zohrans-high-risk-high-reward-strategy)

Silver analyzed Mamdani's electoral coalition, noting his strength in the "commie corridor" of Brooklyn and the Bronx while struggling with Jewish voters (Cuomo won roughly 2:1) and Asian communities. About 45% of voters already had unfavorable views of Mamdani by the end of his campaign, suggesting "something of a ceiling on his support."

### 9. Epstein Files Transparency Crisis

**Coverage:** The Atlantic Daily

The Atlantic Daily provided ongoing coverage of the Justice Department's failure to release the Epstein files as required by the Transparency Act. Nearly a month after missing the December deadline, the DOJ has released less than 1% of the millions of documents.

> "If the Justice Department has legitimate reasons for its delay, it hasn't thoroughly explained what they are... A former high-ranking FBI official who has handled nationwide investigations told me he's skeptical of that defense. 'If we're led to believe that human beings have to go through all of this, I'm not buying all of that.'" — The Atlantic Daily

The article noted 19 of Epstein's victims requested a DOJ watchdog review, alleging redactions have not adequately concealed survivors' names.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### Institutional Breakdown Under Stress
Multiple newsletters converged on the theme of American institutions - the Federal Reserve, the Justice Department, the immigration system - being tested to their limits. [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/sKiMyc4iHA?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/uk7eZ-5Ye66UyYOj9U1e7razgCQG34U1SZLX4IM97VL75FeaEAXDpbcXs-zqor3Eu0-X1zR4g1os6_hQpxM5938dR_BJivb8k5gcqz9C1oh5W73AN3NwuSZhlv34O2vR5NktTAge3X8AYumriehN3LyczoyHSvxy0GPRLr1aqMM68J9mtiwzMtdltCljHGRGC8E_GFTNLJW4hhvOLjlVSehrBDO7v3DXUi5p_tCzahCm_Xxxy9OJCflh-JdG19VhA9T-GPiEt3hY1vRDRK2Bn61kgFfnkz9nzYQLxoevO85EYjRgoBSb1xinnJoUsoobc9-M628P93wDqjgd1c3T4Jroeat294HDGaSpgXYN-EzIFAk7JjzXhjVUcg/bBpZ9kJSdLYCB6V4DcNbQEGgaiZg5bua/16), and The Atlantic Daily all framed the Powell investigation as an existential threat to central bank independence. [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) and [Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39) explored how the international rules-based order is fragmenting.

### The Limits of American Power Abroad
Coverage of Iran from [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/irans-tiananmen-square), [Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39), and [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/sKiMyc4iHA?email=wschenk@gmail.com) revealed deep uncertainty about whether U.S. military action would help or hurt the protest movement. Foreign Affairs explicitly argued that a strike would "prop up" the regime.

### Political Polarization Consuming Both Parties
[Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) argued that Tim Walz's adoption of Trumpian rhetorical tactics contributed to his downfall. [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/sKiMyc4iHA?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported that 45% of Americans now identify as political independents - a record high - even as polarization intensifies.

## Surprising or Contrarian Perspectives

- [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) drew an unexpected parallel between Walz and Trump: "Through Tim Walz, both Minnesota and America have become not less Trumpian but more so. Cruder. Angrier."

- [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-china-commissions-report) offered optimism about rare earth supply chains: "Big things are happening on critical minerals and rare earths. A year ago, nobody was focused on this... This mini-crisis has done more than trigger action - it's prompted genuinely new thinking."

- [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/zohrans-high-risk-high-reward-strategy) noted Mamdani's unexpected appeal to finance workers: "For a younger college-educated professional, even in industries like finance, there's a certain comfort level there."
