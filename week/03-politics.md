# Week 03 Politics Newsletter Analysis (January 12-18, 2026)

## Overview

This week's political newsletters were dominated by three interconnected crises: the Trump administration's unprecedented DOJ investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which drew bipartisan condemnation and raised alarm about central bank independence; Iran's brutal crackdown on protesters with estimates of 12,000-20,000 killed; and the aftermath of the Minneapolis ICE shooting that triggered nationwide protests. Newsletters also examined Tim Walz's political collapse over Minnesota's welfare fraud scandal, Zohran Mamdani's first days as NYC mayor, constitutional debates over birthright citizenship, the strategic implications of Greenland for NATO, and AI's emerging role in national security.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. The Powell Investigation and Federal Reserve Independence

**Coverage:** [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/sKiMyc4iHA?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/uk7eZ-5Ye66UyYOj9U1e7razgCQG34U1SZLX4IM97VL75FeaEAXDpbcXs-zqor3Eu0-X1zR4g1os6_hQpxM5938dR_BJivb8k5gcqz9C1oh5W73AN3NwuSZhlv34O2vR5NktTAge3X8AYumriehN3LyczoyHSvxy0GPRLr1aqMM68J9mtiwzMtdltCljHGRGC8E_GFTNLJW4hhvOLjlVSehrBDO7v3DXUi5p_tCzahCm_Xxxy9OJCflh-JdG19VhA9T-GPiEt3hY1vRDRK2Bn61kgFfnkz9nzYQLxoevO85EYjRgoBSb1xinnJoUsoobc9-M628P93wDqjgd1c3T4Jroeat294HDGaSpgXYN-EzIFAk7JjzXhjVUcg/bBpZ9kJSdLYCB6V4DcNbQEGgaiZg5bua/16), The Atlantic Daily, Emma Tucker WSJ

The week's most consequential domestic story was the Trump administration's Justice Department opening a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over testimony about a building renovation. The move sparked immediate and intense bipartisan backlash.

Powell issued an uncharacteristically blunt video statement linking the probe to the Fed's refusal to lower interest rates:

> "This unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president." — Jerome Powell, via The Atlantic Daily

[Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/sKiMyc4iHA?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported that Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) vowed to oppose any Trump Fed nominee "until this legal matter is fully resolved." [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/uk7eZ-5Ye66UyYOj9U1e7razgCQG34U1SZLX4IM97VL75FeaEAXDpbcXs-zqor3Eu0-X1zR4g1os6_hQpxM5938dR_BJivb8k5gcqz9C1oh5W73AN3NwuSZhlv34O2vR5NktTAge3X8AYumriehN3LyczoyHSvxy0GPRLr1aqMM68J9mtiwzMtdltCljHGRGC8E_GFTNLJW4hhvOLjlVSehrBDO7v3DXUi5p_tCzahCm_Xxxy9OJCflh-JdG19VhA9T-GPiEt3hY1vRDRK2Bn61kgFfnkz9nzYQLxoevO85EYjRgoBSb1xinnJoUsoobc9-M628P93wDqjgd1c3T4Jroeat294HDGaSpgXYN-EzIFAk7JjzXhjVUcg/bBpZ9kJSdLYCB6V4DcNbQEGgaiZg5bua/16) identified Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte as the "driving force" behind the subpoenas.

The Atlantic Daily placed this in historical context, noting that former Fed chairs Yellen, Bernanke, and Greenspan released a joint statement warning: "This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions."

### 2. Iran Crisis: Protests, Crackdown, and U.S. Response Options

**Coverage:** [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/an-epochal-bloodletting-in-iran), [Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39), [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/how-china-courted-iran), [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/bKAduGSf0I8i77lOnn3-cifDKnMyU0HGSVrNJo232YPhPhRDLNUcYT8D3gp6q84wIhLy0RVTuRX1EIhMK9pulaXEeQBcmlRBhUPF71KJiAHreGvPBh-U8opZ8bsXEujexSUg8wPKPVI4DqXDpn7gQo6t3qrE6KaPEJdrV-4vRTcyTbMuAEKKEoH0kzQ2DeSKBzbkF4CwQspR6G-OHFG2BKtkBekbBe27xqysG00UrZR-XIiS_b2HgLcXd7dFuYxuvpb4PsDMvX3UPrFia2tewdUfeOXEVp_HfHwI_uV7nUaa7ADRCPVTEcKik2nHR3p-XnICqjciB2FiRQ4aVheudLmDxWvEMask3N5_u7Sqs0vBUsAug70_xE2eag/SHIcm97K-0Jboz68bsL5c-Jfvofs5kv4/16), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/o0H2qzYmb8?email=wschenk@gmail.com), Emma Tucker WSJ

Iran dominated international coverage as the Islamic Republic faced what multiple newsletters characterized as its most severe crisis since 1979. Massive anti-government protests erupted nationwide, met with a brutal crackdown that killed thousands.

[The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/an-epochal-bloodletting-in-iran) published a harrowing interview with Shay Khatiri, who reported estimates of 12,000 to 20,000 killed, mostly in the first two nights:

> "Based on stories I have heard from inside — I heard from one surgeon at a small private clinic in upper class Tehran... they brought in poor people who were already dead upon arrival. However, there have been nearly a hundred people who were brought in shot with military grade bullets, with their internal organs, intestines, stomachs, wombs, literally hanging out of their bodies." — Shay Khatiri, via [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/an-epochal-bloodletting-in-iran)

[Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/o0H2qzYmb8?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported the U.S. began evacuating military personnel from Qatar as Trump weighed military options. A Western military official told Reuters: "Unpredictability is part of the strategy. All the signals are that a US attack is imminent, but that is also how this administration behaves to keep everyone on their toes."

[Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39) featured Richard Haass on "The Trouble With Regime Change: What History Teaches About When and How to Pursue It" and contrasting views from the Choksys arguing "The Iranian Regime Could Fall — But a U.S. Strike Would Prop It Up."

[ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/how-china-courted-iran) offered a deep dive into China-Iran relations, noting that despite their alignment, "China's favorability declines among the Iranian people" as Beijing has supplied surveillance technology and riot control equipment to the regime.

[Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/bKAduGSf0I8i77lOnn3-cifDKnMyU0HGSVrNJo232YPhPhRDLNUcYT8D3gp6q84wIhLy0RVTuRX1EIhMK9pulaXEeQBcmlRBhUPF71KJiAHreGvPBh-U8opZ8bsXEujexSUg8wPKPVI4DqXDpn7gQo6t3qrE6KaPEJdrV-4vRTcyTbMuAEKKEoH0kzQ2DeSKBzbkF4CwQspR6G-OHFG2BKtkBekbBe27xqysG00UrZR-XIiS_b2HgLcXd7dFuYxuvpb4PsDMvX3UPrFia2tewdUfeOXEVp_HfHwI_uV7nUaa7ADRCPVTEcKik2nHR3p-XnICqjciB2FiRQ4aVheudLmDxWvEMask3N5_u7Sqs0vBUsAug70_xE2eag/SHIcm97K-0Jboz68bsL5c-Jfvofs5kv4/16) outlined three scenarios: a strongman takeover within the IRGC, a direct military coup, or regime collapse into chaos.

### 3. The Minneapolis Shooting and Immigration Enforcement

**Coverage:** [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637), [Bill McKibben/The Crucial Years](https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/pretend-youre-running-for-congress), [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/zohrans-high-risk-high-reward-strategy), The Atlantic Daily

The killing of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis reverberated across newsletters, though coverage varied dramatically by political orientation. Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act as protests continued.

[Bill McKibben](https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/pretend-youre-running-for-congress) called it "the worst week in recent American political history," noting Good's last words were "I'm not mad at you." He reported that Vermont held a half-mile candlelit vigil.

[Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) used the incident as context for its lengthy analysis of Tim Walz's political collapse, framing both the shooting and the welfare fraud scandal as symptoms of progressive governance failures in Minnesota.

[Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/zohrans-high-risk-high-reward-strategy) noted: "I've been struggling with whether to write anything about the killing of Renee Good... A lack of comment should not be taken to indicate a lack of concern. The bottom line is that while there were a lot of 'bad choices' made, this woman shouldn't have wound up dead."

The Atlantic Daily featured Sophie Gilbert's piece "The Unspeakable, Enabled" examining the broader implications.

### 4. Tim Walz's Political Collapse

**Coverage:** [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637)

[Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) published a lengthy postmortem on Tim Walz's decision to drop out of the Minnesota gubernatorial race, attributing it to a welfare fraud scandal that may have cost taxpayers up to $9 billion.

> "Feeding Our Future never delivered any food itself. Its role was instead to 'sponsor' on-the-ground organizations doing actual delivery, acting as an intermediary between those service organizations and the state government." — Darel E. Paul, [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637)

The piece argued that Walz's adoption of "Trumpian name-calling and insults" made him a singular target for the president. By the end, Walz showed "no understanding of how similar he had become to the thing he hates so much."

### 5. Zohran Mamdani's New York

**Coverage:** [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/zohrans-high-risk-high-reward-strategy), [Fix The News](https://fixthenews.com/p/323-iraq-cancer-nancy-drew-the-golden)

Nate Silver offered a detailed electoral analysis of NYC's new socialist mayor, examining whether Mamdani fits his "River vs. Village" framework.

> "I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist... We will replace the frigidity of rugged individualism with the warmth of collectivism." — Zohran Mamdani inaugural address, via [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/zohrans-high-risk-high-reward-strategy)

[Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/zohrans-high-risk-high-reward-strategy) mapped Mamdani's coalition: overwhelming support in Muslim communities, strong performance in Black precincts, dominance in the "commie corridor" of gentrifying Brooklyn, but weakness among Asian communities and Jewish voters. Cuomo won Jewish voters roughly 2:1.

[Fix The News](https://fixthenews.com/p/323-iraq-cancer-nancy-drew-the-golden) quoted Mamdani on NYC's record-low shootings: "Each of those percentage points adds up to dining room tables without an empty seat, lives freed from the dark cloud of grief."

### 6. Greenland and NATO's Future

**Coverage:** [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/o0H2qzYmb8?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39), The Cosmopolitan Globalist

European nations responded to Trump's pressure over Greenland by deploying troops there, while Danish and Greenlandic ministers reported "fundamental disagreement" with Washington after White House talks.

[Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/o0H2qzYmb8?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported that Europe is pursuing "conciliation over confrontation with Trump" while establishing a military presence to demonstrate Arctic commitment.

[Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39) featured Jeremy Shapiro's provocative "How Greenland Falls: Imagining a Bloodless Trump Takeover."

The Cosmopolitan Globalist's headline captured the stakes: "The domino that ends NATO has already been pushed."

### 7. Birthright Citizenship at the Supreme Court

**Coverage:** [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/bd23848f?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637)

[Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/bd23848f?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) published a lengthy historical analysis arguing that the conventional understanding of birthright citizenship is wrong.

> "Birth was not enough... The historical record shows that to come under the king's protection required the king's consent to enter the realm." — Ilan Wurman, [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/bd23848f?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637)

The piece argued that the Fourteenth Amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction" language should exclude children born to illegal or temporary immigrants, urging the Supreme Court to "tread carefully before disabling the political branches from acting in this matter."

### 8. AI, Cybersecurity, and National Security

**Coverage:** [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/richard-danzig-on-ai-and-cyber)

[ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/richard-danzig-on-ai-and-cyber) featured an extensive interview with Richard Danzig, former Secretary of the Navy, on the intersection of AI and national security.

> "The US Department of Defense doesn't need a wake-up call about AI — they're well aware of it. What they need to do is to get out of bed." — Richard Danzig, [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/richard-danzig-on-ai-and-cyber)

Danzig argued that AI represents a transformation comparable to the shift from feudalism to capitalism, but compressed into years rather than centuries. He warned against waiting for AGI: "It's a continuous revolution, and it's happening now."

He drew historical parallels to the 16th century age of exploration, comparing AI companies to the British East India Company: "People think that the British conquered India. No, it was the East India Company." His warning: "I can't imagine a future for AI in which the extraordinary power of a superintelligence was left in the private hands of leaders of OpenAI or xAI or Anthropic or Microsoft."

### 9. 2026 Polling and Midterm Prospects

**Coverage:** [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/actually-sometimes-polls-underestimate)

[Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/actually-sometimes-polls-underestimate) published updated pollster ratings showing 2025 polls had a 7.1-point average error and a 6.1-point average bias toward Republicans — a reversal from presidential cycles that consistently underestimate Trump.

> "The average polling error was 7.1 points in 2025... the polls had an average 6.1-point bias toward Republicans. New Jersey was again an outlier, with a whopping R+9 bias." — [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/actually-sometimes-polls-underestimate)

The newsletter suggested this creates a strategic dilemma for pollsters heading into 2026: "If pollsters who are worried about underestimating Trump three times end up overcompensating, the substantial Republican bias from 2025 could continue into 2026."

### 10. Family Policy and Black Fathers

**Coverage:** [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/e5e5d641?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637)

[Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/e5e5d641?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) published a contrarian review of Harvard sociologist Christina Cross's book "Inherited Inequality," arguing her dismissal of two-parent families for Black children effectively says "black dads don't matter."

> "When progressives dismiss the benefits black children experience from growing up in a two-parent home, they are making a clear statement about the role black men play in the home." — Delano Squires, [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/e5e5d641?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637)

The piece cited data showing the median income for Black married couples under 65 ($121,900) exceeds the overall household income for all racial groups, yet married couples constitute only 28% of Black households.

### 11. Global Positive Developments

**Coverage:** [Fix The News](https://fixthenews.com/p/323-iraq-cancer-nancy-drew-the-golden)

[Fix The News](https://fixthenews.com/p/323-iraq-cancer-nancy-drew-the-golden) provided counterpoint to the week's crises with progress stories: Iraq is "unrecognisable and remarkable" after years of conflict, with poverty falling to 17.5%; trachoma exposure has fallen below 100 million worldwide (down from 1.5 billion in 2002); coal power fell simultaneously in India and China for the first time since 1973; and global cancer deaths have fallen by more than 20% when age-adjusted.

> "Progress doesn't spike cortisol. Disease elimination doesn't trigger shares. That doesn't stop them from happening though." — [Fix The News](https://fixthenews.com/p/323-iraq-cancer-nancy-drew-the-golden)

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Institutional Stress Testing**: Multiple newsletters examined institutions under pressure — the Fed ([Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/uk7eZ-5Ye66UyYOj9U1e7razgCQG34U1SZLX4IM97VL75FeaEAXDpbcXs-zqor3Eu0-X1zR4g1os6_hQpxM5938dR_BJivb8k5gcqz9C1oh5W73AN3NwuSZhlv34O2vR5NktTAge3X8AYumriehN3LyczoyHSvxy0GPRLr1aqMM68J9mtiwzMtdltCljHGRGC8E_GFTNLJW4hhvOLjlVSehrBDO7v3DXUi5p_tCzahCm_Xxxy9OJCflh-JdG19VhA9T-GPiEt3hY1vRDRK2Bn61kgFfnkz9nzYQLxoevO85EYjRgoBSb1xinnJoUsoobc9-M628P93wDqjgd1c3T4Jroeat294HDGaSpgXYN-EzIFAk7JjzXhjVUcg/bBpZ9kJSdLYCB6V4DcNbQEGgaiZg5bua/16), The Atlantic Daily), NATO ([Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39)), and press freedom ([Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/o0H2qzYmb8?email=wschenk@gmail.com) noted the FBI searched a Washington Post reporter's home).

**Unpredictability as Strategy**: Both [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/o0H2qzYmb8?email=wschenk@gmail.com) on Iran and WSJ on Trump's broader agenda emphasized that deliberate unpredictability has become administration policy. A Western military official told Reuters this is "how this administration behaves to keep everyone on their toes."

**Coalition Politics**: [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/zohrans-high-risk-high-reward-strategy) on Mamdani and [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/6fe3c11c?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) on Walz both examined how political coalitions form, fracture, and fail under pressure.

**Technology and Geopolitics**: [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/how-china-courted-iran) on China-Iran and [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/richard-danzig-on-ai-and-cyber) on AI both highlighted how technology is reshaping geopolitical competition in ways legacy institutions struggle to grasp.

**Myanmar's Potemkin Election**: [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/bKAduGSf0I8i77lOnn3-cifDKnMyU0HGSVrNJo232YPhPhRDLNUcYT8D3gp6q84wIhLy0RVTuRX1EIhMK9pulaXEeQBcmlRBhUPF71KJiAHreGvPBh-U8opZ8bsXEujexSUg8wPKPVI4DqXDpn7gQo6t3qrE6KaPEJdrV-4vRTcyTbMuAEKKEoH0kzQ2DeSKBzbkF4CwQspR6G-OHFG2BKtkBekbBe27xqysG00UrZR-XIiS_b2HgLcXd7dFuYxuvpb4PsDMvX3UPrFia2tewdUfeOXEVp_HfHwI_uV7nUaa7ADRCPVTEcKik2nHR3p-XnICqjciB2FiRQ4aVheudLmDxWvEMask3N5_u7Sqs0vBUsAug70_xE2eag/SHIcm97K-0Jboz68bsL5c-Jfvofs5kv4/16) examined how China, Russia, and India are re-engaging with Myanmar's military junta despite its sham election, noting "In this election, minerals, oil and territory matter more than ballots."

## Contrarian and Surprising Takes

**The Cosmopolitan Globalist** on Iran: Against the conventional wisdom that intervention would unite Iranians behind their regime, Shay Khatiri argued: "They're literally putting their lives on the line to oust this regime, but God forbid if America does something, they will go back behind the regime that's killing them. This is insane."

**Compact** on family structure: Against progressive consensus, [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/e5e5d641?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) argued that dismissing the benefits of two-parent homes for Black children effectively says "black dads don't matter."

**Silver Bulletin** on polling: Against the assumption that polls always underestimate Republicans, Nate Silver showed 2025 polls were biased toward Republicans by 6.1 points.

**ChinaTalk** on AI timelines: Richard Danzig pushed back against both AI doomers and accelerationists, arguing that waiting for AGI is "like waiting for the Messiah" — a strategic error that misses the "continuous revolution" happening now.

**Bloomberg Weekend** on tiny teams: Forecasters predict 50% chance that by 2032, at least three companies with five or fewer full-time employees will have $10 billion+ valuations, suggesting "Ideas are a dime a dozen; it's execution that matters" may no longer be true.
