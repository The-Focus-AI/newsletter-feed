[The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/view/668d137112b797104109b7bcpxsc9.15nm/e62bcfe3) took a notably sympathetic view of Powell, with coverage titled "The Candor of Jerome Powell" emphasizing Powell's "thankless rescue of Trump" from his own economic policies.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Institutional Trust Under Strain**: Multiple newsletters—[The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/view/668d137112b797104109b7bcpxsc9.15nm/e62bcfe3), [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/u/click?_t=9f36cad84c784e09ba5a7e96a95f40a8&_m=d89be21dd2e94c51be3bba2b86d0acb4&_e=eNpl0EuOwyAMANC7sDYCQoDZzbxYk_MfIoMdzShqI5GO1dOX%2FK5hfXr2fYnHoMjOKvdP4xN0x1KQTMu_3kJGEI2ykXVS4i9TXdl7M-M1lk9Y3jD), [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/LUfVHmLaAg?email=wschenk@gmail.com)—emphasized concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department, whether through the Powell investigation or the Epstein files delays. The phrase "corrosive doubt" from [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/tEUdPKdLME?email=wschenk@gmail.com) captured the broader theme.

**Regime Change Debates**: Both Iran and Venezuela prompted extensive debate about U.S. intervention. [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/cp/184781656) and [Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39) grappled with whether to support regime change outcomes even when skeptical of the methods or actors delivering them.

**Alliance Tensions**: From Greenland to NATO concerns over Iran policy, multiple newsletters noted strain in traditional U.S. alliances. [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/cp/184756627) was most alarmed, while [Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39) treated it as a policy question requiring careful analysis.

**"Unpredictability as Strategy"**: [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/0J0TFDhG0j?email=wschenk@gmail.com) explicitly named this as the administration's approach, a framing echoed implicitly across coverage of Greenland, Iran, the Powell investigation, and trade policy.

## Surprising or Contrarian Takes

- [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/actually-sometimes-polls-underestimate): Contrary to expectations after 2024, 2025 polls actually overestimated Republicans by 6.1 points on average, suggesting the "Trump effect" may be specific to presidential ballots.

- [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/0cae1a38?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637): "The New Right Is More Right Than Wrong on Family Policy" offered a heterodox take on conservative social policy from an outlet that defies easy categorization.

- [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/cp/184781656): Posed the uncomfortable question of whether liberals can support regime change in Iran even if delivered by Trump—a genuine moral dilemma rather than rhetorical exercise.

- [Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39): Colin H. Kahl's "The Myth of the AI Race" pushed back against dominant narratives of U.S.-China technological competition, arguing neither country can achieve true dominance.
