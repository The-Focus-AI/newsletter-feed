## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Iran's Bloody Crackdown and U.S. Response Debate

**Coverage:** [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/KDTK0kq8nX?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/an-epochal-bloodletting-in-iran), [Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

The Iranian regime's response to anti-government protests that erupted around New Year's became the week's most significant international story, with estimates of casualties ranging from 12,000 to 20,000 dead in what some described as a Tiananmen-level massacre.

[The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/an-epochal-bloodletting-in-iran) published an extensive interview with Shay Khatiri offering granular detail from inside Iran:

> "It's a serious estimate. Between 12 to 20,000 [dead]... Based on videos uploaded online—and this is at a time when internet is mostly disconnected—we have verified 180 body bags." — Shay Khatiri, [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/an-epochal-bloodletting-in-iran)

Khatiri reported that every contact inside Iran was calling for foreign intervention:

> "We're doing everything we can, but it's not enough. We're willing to do whatever we can, but we need foreign help... Everybody I have talked to also wants outside help." — [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/an-epochal-bloodletting-in-iran)

[Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/KDTK0kq8nX?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported on Iranians using Starlink to bypass the regime's internet blackout, noting that SpaceX had made access free in Iran and Trump had asked Musk to boost connectivity. However, the government was confiscating terminals—with Khatiri suggesting many illicit Starlink sales were run by the IRGC itself.

Khatiri raised an important technical point about direct-to-cell satellite that U.S. policy hadn't addressed:

> "Just to explain how stupid our government is: direct-to-cell requires your carrier to be compatible with Starlink... If we issue this waiver right now, within hours, 15 percent of Iranians will have internet access." — [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/an-epochal-bloodletting-in-iran)

By mid-week, [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported the immediate risk of U.S. strikes had waned:

> "Officials advised US President Donald Trump that an attack would be unlikely to topple the government... Israel and Arab governments pressed him not to follow through on his threat." — [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

The Iranian opposition remained fragmented, with [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) noting "a disparate grouping of leftists, monarchists, and republicans holding differing views and lacking a clear leader."

[Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39) featured multiple perspectives on regime change, including Richard Haass on "The Trouble With Regime Change: What History Teaches About When and How to Pursue It" and Andrew P. Miller on "Iran and the Limits of American Power."

### 2. Federal Reserve Independence Under Siege

**Coverage:** [The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/click/43495577.573870/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29t), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/RbQWvvFTWO?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/dsL9o1V9ox-I36cMV2ZEcArbRJ_8EgSCJBMpEDoRF5v68WGfUkXIPw-SQxymXKRSUVAfwVsSlFLq6HBg4TkNpL446mCSyKwBE_ld8CuGz6sJWpJqG76NN7p_luua9znPiTBiUGK_7iSBV5KF5Xt0UNP37LCIBjiD8YbA_Gx8lxBPAO_fDzm_x0HPQPHnSnSC8YVVlVCocuPa6vZRZQiWrqezhlANHa_xDqVuSqlEZYi7KHwy6ioQ2b4ZXuddW-aKGNFM6sJ10EXFYVyNTAEHQX8tPX4GZExy9t6Fi2qAcviTXI7rgLqUUBdeEZcYsQ74MmajSlZ393UTkHQfPqHL3pRBXDfwhBIwr33eRFwB2D4XYhNFsuRW6VhLBA/qiRf6fw1iTnxg_ajNuyCp9mU2H6UcsdZ/16), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/KDTK0kq8nX?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

The Trump administration's criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell dominated early-week coverage, with multiple outlets noting the bipartisan alarm it sparked.

[The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/click/43495577.573870/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29t) reported Powell's unprecedented video statement:

> "This unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president." — Jerome Powell, via [The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/click/43495577.573870/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29t)

[Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/dsL9o1V9ox-I36cMV2ZEcArbRJ_8EgSCJBMpEDoRF5v68WGfUkXIPw-SQxymXKRSUVAfwVsSlFLq6HBg4TkNpL446mCSyKwBE_ld8CuGz6sJWpJqG76NN7p_luua9znPiTBiUGK_7iSBV5KF5Xt0UNP37LCIBjiD8YbA_Gx8lxBPAO_fDzm_x0HPQPHnSnSC8YVVlVCocuPa6vZRZQiWrqezhlANHa_xDqVuSqlEZYi7KHwy6ioQ2b4ZXuddW-aKGNFM6sJ10EXFYVyNTAEHQX8tPX4GZExy9t6Fi2qAcviTXI7rgLqUUBdeEZcYsQ74MmajSlZ393UTkHQfPqHL3pRBXDfwhBIwr33eRFwB2D4XYhNFsuRW6VhLBA/qiRf6fw1iTnxg_ajNuyCp9mU2H6UcsdZ/16) reported that "Global central bankers threw their support behind Jerome Powell, saying they 'stand in full solidarity' with the Fed."

Former Fed chairs Yellen, Bernanke, and Greenspan released a joint statement:

> "This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly." — Joint statement, via [The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/click/43495577.573870/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29t)

[Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/RbQWvvFTWO?email=wschenk@gmail.com) quoted Republican Senator criticism:

> "We need this like we need a hole in the head." — GOP Senator, quoted by [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/RbQWvvFTWO?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

Jamie Dimon's public criticism of the probe prompted a Trump rebuke, with [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/KDTK0kq8nX?email=wschenk@gmail.com) noting the broader context: Trump also called for banks to cap credit-card rates at 10%, potentially costing banks "$100 billion a year."

### 3. Minneapolis ICE Shooting and "Threat Inflation"

**Coverage:** [The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/click/43572165.535832/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29t), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/RbQWvvFTWO?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

The fatal shooting of Renee Good by ICE officer Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis sparked protests and a fierce debate about administration rhetoric. [The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/click/43523869.521860/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29t) offered the week's sharpest critique:

> "A series of choices by the administration led to this point—the use of ICE and Border Patrol to menace Democratic-led states and cities; White House pressure on the Department of Homeland Security to make high quotas, which has resulted in shortened training and rushed missions." — [The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/click/43523869.521860/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29t)

By Thursday, [The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/click/43572165.535832/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29t) published a comprehensive critique of what it termed "threat inflation":

> "The president and his allies constantly tell Americans that they face catastrophe on all sides—that the country is besieged by weapons of mass destruction, narco-terrorists, invaders, insurrectionists, and terrorists. This misleading rhetoric stokes fear in order to justify extreme measures." — Conor Friedersdorf, [The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/click/43572165.535832/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29t)

The piece noted Trump's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act for Minneapolis and cataloged Stephen Miller's extensive use of "insurrection" to describe judges, protesters, and Democrats—while never applying it to January 6th. The newsletter also noted Trump's declaration that fentanyl is a "weapon of mass destruction," arguing this misuses terminology historically reserved for existential threats to cities or nations.

### 4. Greenland and Transatlantic Relations

**Coverage:** [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/KDTK0kq8nX?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/cp/184756627), [Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/g1f4tTMFHc?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/UZoI5MtNFU?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

Trump's continued push to acquire Greenland strained U.S.-Europe relations throughout the week. [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/KDTK0kq8nX?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported on Greenland's prime minister rejecting U.S. membership:

> "That's going to be a big problem for him." — Donald Trump, responding to Greenland PM's rejection, [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/KDTK0kq8nX?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

[The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/cp/184756627) offered a stark assessment with its headline: "The domino that ends NATO has already been pushed."

[Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39) featured Jeremy Shapiro's analysis "How Greenland Falls: Imagining a Bloodless Trump Takeover."

[Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/UZoI5MtNFU?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported by week's end that Canada was pivoting toward China for trade, and that Trump's pressure was pushing traditional allies to diversify economic relationships.

By the weekend, [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/g1f4tTMFHc?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported Trump was positioning for a Nobel Prize over his approaches to both Greenland and Iran.

### 5. China's Economic Trajectory and U.S.-China Competition

**Coverage:** [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/KDTK0kq8nX?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-china-commissions-report), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/g1f4tTMFHc?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

[Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/KDTK0kq8nX?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported China's record $1.2 trillion trade surplus:

> "While shipments to the US have plummeted, exports to Africa, Europe, and Southeast Asia surged in 2025, feeding anxiety that local industries may be decimated by cheap Chinese imports." — [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/KDTK0kq8nX?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

[ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-china-commissions-report) published an extensive interview with two U.S.-China Commission members who offered a sophisticated analysis of the challenge:

> "China has a two-speed economy. The broader macroeconomy is slowing down significantly due to slowing domestic demand, weak consumption, and a deflating property bubble. But the national security side of the economy is running at a different pace." — Leland Miller, [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-china-commissions-report)

The piece highlighted alarming supply chain vulnerabilities:

> "China doesn't ship many finished drugs to the U.S., but it dominates the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) behind medications and the key starting materials (KSMs) behind those APIs... APIs and KSMs sound technical and boring—until you realize China may control U.S. access to insulin, heparin, and antibiotics for both civilians and troops. That's an enormous vulnerability." — Leland Miller, [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-china-commissions-report)

The commissioners advocated for a new economic statecraft agency, drawing parallels to post-9/11 reforms:

> "The current structure sets up export controls and sanctions to fail. At the Commerce Department, the undersecretary is in charge of export controls, but the secretary is in charge of promoting U.S. businesses abroad. He is structurally disincentivized from enacting tough policy." — Leland Miller, [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-china-commissions-report)

[Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported on the U.S.-Taiwan trade deal finalizing $250 billion in semiconductor investment and noted Chinese antitrust action against solar alliance efforts.

[Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/g1f4tTMFHc?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported China achieved 5% GDP growth, though accompanied by continued demographic decline.

### 6. Venezuela Post-Maduro

**Coverage:** [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/PQxqtmTyO7?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/click/43572165.535832/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29t)

Coverage tracked the evolving situation in post-Maduro Venezuela. [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/PQxqtmTyO7?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported on the U.S. selling Venezuelan oil worth $500 million and Delcy Rodriguez consolidating power as interim president.

[Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) noted Rodriguez was reforming hydrocarbon laws to attract foreign investment:

> "Trump predicted the oil industry would be 'up and running' within 18 months... However, experts have warned that conditions there—including the risk of further violence—may discourage investments." — [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

[The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/click/43572165.535832/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29t) reported opposition leader Maria Corina Machado visited the White House and "presented her Nobel Peace Prize to Trump during the visit; it is not yet clear whether he accepted the award."

### 7. Global Trade Realignment

**Coverage:** [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/KDTK0kq8nX?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

Multiple sources tracked countries diversifying away from U.S. economic dependence. [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported:

> "Kenya, subject to a 10% US levy, signed a preliminary agreement with China that would give 98% of its exports duty-free access to the Chinese market... The prime minister of Canada—which sends three-quarters of its exports to the US—is in Beijing seeking to boost bilateral trade. The European Union and India have also made progress toward a trade agreement." — [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

[Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/KDTK0kq8nX?email=wschenk@gmail.com) also noted Brazil's $3 billion trade surplus with Iran risks making it a target of U.S. tariffs, potentially reversing recent rapprochement between Brasilia and Washington.

### 8. Institutional Independence Under Attack

**Coverage:** [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/click/43572165.535832/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29t), [Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39)

Beyond the Fed probe, multiple newsletters documented the administration's efforts to bring independent institutions under political control. [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported:

> "The Pentagon will overhaul the military newspaper Stars and Stripes, potentially ending the outlet's long-standing, Congressionally affirmed editorial independence. The Department of Defense said the paper had become 'woke' and should focus coverage on 'warfighting.'" — [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

Additional institutional pressures included:
- The White House pressuring the Smithsonian to promote a positive view of the U.S.
- An executive order making independent regulators accountable to the White House
- Pressure on the Kennedy Center board to rename it the "Trump-Kennedy Center"

[Foreign Affairs This Week](https://link.foreignaffairs.com/view/64456883d447307be60958dcpxv2c.knrm/37eb4a39) featured Oona A. Hathaway and Scott J. Shapiro on "A World Without Rules: The Consequences of Trump's Assault on International Law."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Institutional Stress Testing**: Multiple newsletters examined institutions under pressure—the Fed, NATO, Stars and Stripes, and the Smithsonian all faced administration challenges. [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/dsL9o1V9ox-I36cMV2ZEcArbRJ_8EgSCJBMpEDoRF5v68WGfUkXIPw-SQxymXKRSUVAfwVsSlFLq6HBg4TkNpL446mCSyKwBE_ld8CuGz6sJWpJqG76NN7p_luua9znPiTBiUGK_7iSBV5KF5Xt0UNP37LCIBjiD8YbA_Gx8lxBPAO_fDzm_x0HPQPHnSnSC8YVVlVCocuPa6vZRZQiWrqezhlANHa_xDqVuSqlEZYi7KHwy6ioQ2b4ZXuddW-aKGNFM6sJ10EXFYVyNTAEHQX8tPX4GZExy9t6Fi2qAcviTXI7rgLqUUBdeEZcYsQ74MmajSlZ393UTkHQfPqHL3pRBXDfwhBIwr33eRFwB2D4XYhNFsuRW6VhLBA/qiRf6fw1iTnxg_ajNuyCp9mU2H6UcsdZ/16), [The Atlantic Daily](https://link.theatlantic.com/click/43495577.573870/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29t), and [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) all documented this pattern.

**Bipartisan Concern Breaking Through**: On the Fed probe specifically, Republicans joined Democrats in criticism—a rare moment of bipartisan pushback noted by [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/RbQWvvFTWO?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

**Global Trade Realignment**: [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) tracked countries diversifying away from U.S. economic dependence: Kenya signing a China deal, Canada visiting Beijing, and EU-India trade talks accelerating—all responses to Washington's protectionism.

**Technology as Geopolitical Lever**: Starlink in Iran, semiconductor trade deals with Taiwan, and China's rare earth controls all illustrated technology's central role in great power competition. [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/an-epochal-bloodletting-in-iran), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com), and [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-china-commissions-report) each explored different dimensions.

**UK Conservative Collapse**: [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/mK09VYx5G3?email=wschenk@gmail.com) noted a prominent Conservative defected to Reform UK, calling the Tories' situation "the most significant sign of fracturing in one of the world's oldest and most consistently successful political parties."

## Notable Quotes of the Week

On Iran intervention debates:
> "There's this idea outside that if we intervene, Iranians might rally behind the regime, which is insane to me. They're literally, literally putting their lives on the line to oust this regime, but God forbid if America does something, they will go back behind the regime that's killing them. This is insane." — Shay Khatiri, [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/an-epochal-bloodletting-in-iran)

On the Iran opposition's challenges:
> "Overthrowing the regime is not difficult. Keeping the country together after is extremely difficult. I'm much more worried about that." — Shay Khatiri, [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/an-epochal-bloodletting-in-iran)

On supply chain vulnerabilities:
> "APIs and KSMs sound technical and boring—until you realize China may control U.S. access to insulin, heparin, and antibiotics for both civilians and troops. That's an enormous vulnerability." — Leland Miller, [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-china-commissions-report)

On economic statecraft:
