## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Madeline Cash's Debut Novel and the Unconventional Path to Publication

**Coverage:** [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2)

The most substantive literary feature this week came from Book Gossip's in-depth interview with Madeline Cash about her debut novel *Lost Lambs*. Cash, the 29-year-old co-founder of Forever Magazine, described her unconventional journey to publication, which included founding a literary magazine during the pandemic and essentially stalking her future editor to a party.

> "I kind of begged him to read it. I don't think that he really wanted to, but he did. Thank God." — [Madeline Cash, Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2)

Cash's refreshingly honest account of the publishing process included quitting her job as head copywriter for Jack in the Box after the book sold, and her self-aware assessment of her approach:

> "This is not an instruction manual for a debut writer. I think that this was all really unprecedented. I got really lucky, and I was really stubborn. I don't think this is traditionally how people get published, and it's probably how people get restraining orders." — [Madeline Cash, Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2)

The newsletter also included brief reviews of new releases, notably Karl Ove Knausgaard's *The School of Night* and Larissa Pham's *Discipline*.

### 2. Literary Anniversaries: Bacon, Swift, and Smith in 2026

**Coverage:** [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries)

Henry Oliver's Common Reader newsletter highlighted three significant literary anniversaries in 2026: four hundred years since the death of Francis Bacon, three hundred years since *Gulliver's Travels*, and two-hundred-and-fifty years since *The Wealth of Nations*.

> "Swift is perhaps the most intelligent writer in the English canon. Bacon has many turns of phrase that are as vivid and memorable as those of the great poets. Smith is a splendid writer who uses details and stories in his work in ways that he clearly learned from novelists." — [Henry Oliver, The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries)

Oliver noted that these writers represent "a more rational, discursive, and argumentative tradition in English literature" that receives less attention outside academia than the beloved novelists like Austen.

### 3. Iran's Blackout and Protests

**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-afllo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z)

The NYRB featured Amir Ahmadi Arian's essay on Iran's government-imposed internet blackout during antigovernment protests. The piece offered a deeply personal perspective on the experience of exile and the anxiety of being unable to reach loved ones during crises.

> "Since I left Iran in 2011, life in exile has been marked by 'a permanent anxiety, a compulsive worry about the safety of loved ones who are hard to reach.'" — [Amir Ahmadi Arian, New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-afllo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z)

The newsletter noted that reports suggest "many hundreds or even thousands of protesters have already been killed" in the past five days, and compiled five pieces about the history of uprisings and state violence in Iran since the 1953 US-backed coup.

William Neuman's piece in [NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asxkd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yh) assessed the Venezuelan opposition's invitation for US military intervention. The newsletter described the piece as examining how "the Venezuelan opposition leader courted US military intervention -- but she did not get what she bargained for."

[Max Read](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXhyZWFkLnN1YnN0YWNrLmNvbS9wL3RhbGtpbmctbWlubmVhcG9saXMtdmVuZXp1ZWxhLWVsb24_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRMU5qazVOakVzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RRM09UTXpNQ3dpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TURjeE16TXdMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpreU9EY3pJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS4ySk9aWE0ycjdha1cyUEEwaWpJbGFLdG1ubXBLd0E4N3FjZ1FyQXBPbzgwIiwicCI6MTg0NTY5OTYxLCJzIjozOTI4NzMsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg0NzkzMzAsImV4cCI6MjA4NDA1NTMzMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.vjPBuJqxUtVwbG3v4w-xzMG_MTFr2Uaeu4VL4TZAssg?) also covered Venezuela in their Substack Live discussion with Vinson Cunningham, discussing "the abduction of Nicolas Maduro and the increasingly bellicosity of the Trump administration."

### 5. French Poetry: Emmanuel Hocquard's Elegies

**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aejyo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a)

NYRB Classics highlighted the publication of Emmanuel Hocquard's *Elegies*, translated by Cole Swensen. Peter Gizzi praised the work:

> "It is a major event to have Emmanuel Hocquard's masterwork available to a new audience.... The capacious voice of these poems conjures a layered presence where each perception feels far away in time and yet extraordinarily intimate and direct." — [Peter Gizzi, quoted in New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aejyo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a)

The newsletter included sample poems and noted Hocquard's distinction between "classic" and "inverse" elegiac poets -- the classic ruminates on the past while the inverse remakes it.

NYRB promoted three books by Amit Chaudhuri, including his new essay collection *Incompleteness* and the novels *The Immortals* and *A New World*. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie praised *A New World*:

> "Unbelievably beautiful; I like to dip in and out, a few pages at a time, letting the words nurture me." — [Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, quoted in New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aetrz-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jh)

Jo Segura was highlighted as "the queen of the adventure rom-com" according to Ali Hazelwood, promoting *The Lust Crusade*.

### 8. Marilynne Robinson's Bible Seminars

**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-astujd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p)

The NYRB announced two new seminar series by Pulitzer Prize-winner Marilynne Robinson on the Old and New Testaments starting in March and May 2026.

> "The course as a whole is intended to draw attention to the fact that the Scriptures are, whatever else, a very great literature. Considering their importance to Western Civilization, it is remarkable how vulnerable they are now to misuse and ridicule." — [Marilynne Robinson, New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-astujd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p)

### 9. American Suburban Life Through British Eyes

**Coverage:** [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/driving-like-a-video-game)

Henry Oliver offered a wry observational essay on adjusting to life in Virginia, focusing on American driving habits that he finds alarming compared to UK norms.

> "American drivers in this part of Virginia are generally uninterested in one another's need to change lanes and make turns. Many of them drive like they are in a video game, as if there are points for being closer to the next red light." — [Henry Oliver, The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/driving-like-a-video-game)

The essay also touched on thrift store culture and the unique spatial organization of American suburbs.

**Support for Independent Publishing**: [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KEVT7H4P417X1ZMAYEKB3W4J_3) continued to emphasize their mission of supporting independent bookstores (noting they've raised $40+ million), while [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2) highlighted the small-press origins of Madeline Cash's career.

**Literary Tradition and Canon**: Both [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries) and [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-astujd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p) engaged with questions of literary canon and tradition -- Oliver celebrating rationalist prose writers often overlooked, Robinson defending scripture as literature worth serious study.

**Commercial vs. Literary**: The newsletters showed a clear divide between [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KEVT7H4P417X1ZMAYEKB3W4J_3)'s promotional focus on romance and genre fiction versus [NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aejyo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a)'s emphasis on translated literary works and critical essays.
