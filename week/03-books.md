# Week 03 Books Newsletter Analysis

**Week of January 12-17, 2026**

## Overview

This week's books newsletters present a striking range of literary perspectives, from deep philosophical investigations into the nature of intelligence and problem-solving to intimate behind-the-scenes accounts of the modern publishing industry. The week's standout piece is an extended meditation on George Polya's classic "How to Solve It," which uses the mathematical problem-solving framework as a lens for understanding intelligence itself, AI capabilities, and the accumulated wisdom of intellectual traditions.

Meanwhile, the publishing world surfaces through a candid interview with debut novelist Madeline Cash, whose unconventional path to a major book deal (including "stalking" her editor to a warehouse party) offers a counternarrative to traditional publishing wisdom. British author Henry Oliver provides cultural commentary on American life and previews significant literary anniversaries in 2026, while Max Read's newsletter pivots into political territory, discussing current events through a cultural lens with novelist Vinson Cunningham.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Intelligence, Problem-Solving, and AI

**Coverage**: Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf

The week's most substantial piece is an extended 7,000+ word review of George Polya's "How to Solve It" (1945) that expands into a philosophical treatise on intelligence itself. The author challenges both egalitarian pretensions about intelligence and the smug "elite human capital" crowd, proposing instead a pragmatic definition: "intelligence is the ability of an agent to achieve its goals."

**Key Quote**:
> "Some people are just smarter than others. It offends every notion of fairness we have, fills the privileged with guilt and the overlooked with rage: some people are just smarter than others. We fear that admitting it would open the door to countless horrors: revolution or genocide or a new caste system maybe, so we bury it beneath a thousand educational interventions."
> *-- Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf*

On embryo selection startups exposing American contradictions about intelligence:
> "Here come the embryo selection startups crashing through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man yelling: 'LMAO, IT'S ALL JUST RANDOMNESS PLUS WHO YOUR PARENTS ARE.'"

The piece argues that while raw intelligence varies, "effective intelligence" can be dramatically increased through accumulated problem-solving heuristics -- what Polya called a "toolbox" of mental moves. This leads to a striking claim about AI:

> "Reams and reams of examples, not of solutions to particular problems, but of exceptional problem-solving itself. Vast hordes of 'moves,' a shimmering toolbox filled with high-quality heuristics. All that an agent needs to vastly boost its externally-measured intelligence in furtherance of its goals."

The author suggests that AI training on human reasoning examples may constitute genuine intelligence enhancement rather than mere pattern matching. The review ends with an ominous note: "Intelligence is the ability of an agent to achieve its goals. Let's hope that theirs are in line with ours."

### 2. The Publishing Industry and Unconventional Paths to Success

**Coverage**: Book Gossip

Madeline Cash's interview provides a candid look at modern publishing that subverts expectations. Key elements of her story:

- Self-published a short story collection "Earth Angel" with a "really, really small press" that spelled her name wrong in the first printing
- Founded Forever Magazine during the pandemic as a reading series in Hollywood Forever Cemetery, coding the website herself with "stimulus money"
- Worked as head copywriter for Jack in the Box while writing her novel
- Used Post-its and spreadsheets to plot the novel; wrote mostly evenings and weekends
- "Stalked" her dream editor Jackson Howard to a warehouse party in Chinatown rather than following traditional submission processes
- Completed the novel during a self-inflicted writing residency at her "Aunt Brenda's" apartment in Stuy Town

**Key Quote**:
> "I kind of begged him to read it. I don't think that he really wanted to, but he did. Thank God. We didn't send it anywhere else. My agent said, 'It is kind of traditional to shop it around,' but I was like, 'No.'"
> *-- Madeline Cash in Book Gossip*

The result: her debut "Lost Lambs" (described as "The Corrections meets Eyes Wide Shut") sold rights in 15 territories and secured a major film acquisition before publication. Cash herself notes: "This is not an instruction manual for a debut writer. I think that this was all really unprecedented. I got really lucky, and I was really stubborn. I don't think this is traditionally how people get published, and it's probably how people get restraining orders."

The newsletter also includes brief reviews:
- **Karl Ove Knausgaard's "The School of Night"**: Buy recommendation. "Being in this narrator's head is exhausting; thankfully, at various points over the book's 500 pages, it tips into being hilarious."
- **Larissa Pham's "Discipline"**: Borrow recommendation. "Read it if you consider yourself a rigorous person."

### 3. Literary Anniversaries and the "Rational" English Tradition

**Coverage**: Henry Oliver from The Common Reader

Oliver highlights three major literary anniversaries in 2026 that he finds more interesting than typical centenaries:
- 400 years since the death of Francis Bacon (1626)
- 300 years since Gulliver's Travels (1726)
- 250 years since The Wealth of Nations (1776)

He argues these represent an underappreciated tradition in English literature:

> "They represent a part of English literature that gets less attention outside the academy. They are not loved like Austen and Auden. But the essays, utopias, treatises, pamphlets, and philosophy of these three writers are as much literature as anything else."
> *-- Henry Oliver*

On their shared qualities:
> "Bacon, Smith, and Swift share many qualities: they are all splendid prose writers; they are all interested in science, politics, and the future; they stand in a line of inheritance to each other."

His claim that "Swift is perhaps the most intelligent writer in the English canon" positions the satirist above more commonly celebrated figures. He also notes that "Bacon has many turns of phrase that are as vivid and memorable as those of the great poets" and that "Smith is a splendid writer who uses details and stories in his work in ways that he clearly learned from novelists."

Other 2026 centenaries mentioned: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Tom Sawyer, Winnie-the-Pooh, The Sun Also Rises, The Castle, and The Last Battle.

### 4. Cultural Observations: An Englishman in America

**Coverage**: Henry Oliver from The Common Reader

Oliver's piece on driving in Virginia offers sharply observed cultural commentary on American suburban life:

**Key Quote**:
> "American drivers in this part of Virginia are generally uninterested in one another's need to change lanes and make turns. Many of them drive like they are in a video game, as if there are points for being closer to the next red light. People pop in and out of lanes--and in front of other cars--like characters in Mario Kart."
> *-- Henry Oliver*

He catalogues alarming driving behaviors with vivid detail:
> "Another driver recently was moving erratically around in the lane... As we passed, we saw that he was not only holding a huge sandwich in his hand from which he occasionally took bites without looking up, like a teenage boy eating in front of a video game, but was looking down into his lap--no doubt at his phone."

On practical differences that favor American suburban life:
> "In ten minutes, I can drive to more than one library that is open until 8 p.m. (good luck with that in London), as well as multiple markets, bookshops, and so on."

He notes the disorientation of American geography for a British newcomer:
> "In this part of Virginia, there are no towns... mostly it is roads and car parks and clusters of shops. One must look differently to find the best places."

On driving tests: "The practical driving test I took was so basic I nearly asked them if they weren't sure they didn't need to see more than me changing lanes." He quotes Reddit users confirming: "Just had to drive straight and make a few left and right turns and then had to park again at the DMV."

### 5. Current Events Through a Literary Lens

**Coverage**: Max Read

Max Read's newsletter this week featured a Substack Live conversation with John Ganz (author of "When the Clock Broke") and novelist Vinson Cunningham (New Yorker staff writer, author of "Great Expectations") covering:
- Renee Good's murder and "the Trump administration's ongoing siege of Minneapolis"
- "The abduction of Nicolas Maduro and the increasingly bellicosity of the Trump administration"
- Dexter Filkins' profile of Marco Rubio
- "Elon Musk and the Grok child porn fiasco"

This represents the intersection of literary and political discourse, with writers engaging current events through their cultural expertise.

## Cross-Newsletter Themes

### Theme 1: The Value of Accumulated Knowledge and Tradition

Both the Psmith review and Henry Oliver's anniversaries piece emphasize how intellectual progress depends on inherited wisdom. Psmith argues that ancient geniuses were slower to make discoveries partly because they lacked "reams and reams of examples... of exceptional problem-solving itself" -- the accumulated "moves" that modern thinkers inherit:

> "In Newton's phrasing it's not just that we stand on the shoulders of giants, it's that we get to see how they got so tall in the first place."

Oliver celebrates Bacon, Swift, and Smith as writers who "stand in a line of inheritance to each other," representing a tradition of rational discourse.

**Convergence**: Both writers value intellectual inheritance and the slow accumulation of wisdom across generations.

### Theme 2: Unconventional Paths to Success

Both Madeline Cash's publishing story and the Psmith piece on Polya challenge conventional wisdom about achievement. Cash succeeded by ignoring "traditional" submission processes; Psmith argues you can become effectively smarter through method rather than innate ability:

> "You're allowed to come at the problem with a roadmap and a battle plan, and by doing so you are boosting your effective intelligence many times."

Both suggest that success requires stubborn persistence and willingness to deviate from established patterns.

### Theme 3: The Outsider's Perspective

Henry Oliver writing about America as a British transplant, and the Psmith author noting they "were raised outside of the United States" -- both bring outsider perspectives that allow them to observe cultural assumptions Americans take for granted. The books category seems to attract cosmopolitan writers with comparative cultural interests.

### Theme 4: The Value of Non-Fiction and "Rational" Writing

Oliver explicitly champions "essays, utopias, treatises, pamphlets, and philosophy" as literature equal to novels, while Psmith's 7,000-word book review of a mathematics text demonstrates this tradition in practice. Both celebrate intellectual prose writing that is neither fiction nor poetry.

## Surprising or Notable Insights

- **"Assume we had a can opener" is good problem-solving** -- The Psmith review rehabilitates the mocked philosopher's approach, arguing that in reality (unlike desert islands) "there is usually a way to make or borrow or buy or steal or invent whatever thing it is you might need." The technique of identifying what would make a problem easy, then working backward, is praised as genuinely useful. ([Source](../content/books/mr-and-mrs-psmith-s-bookshelf/2026-01-12-review-how-to-solve-it-by-george-p-lya.md))

- **Sometimes making problems harder makes them easier** -- The "inventor's paradox" suggests that zooming out to solve a more general problem can be easier than attacking a specific case. Alexander Grothendieck is cited as the master of this technique, "solving problems by zooming out and out and out and out until the original question was barely visible." ([Source](../content/books/mr-and-mrs-psmith-s-bookshelf/2026-01-12-review-how-to-solve-it-by-george-p-lya.md))

- **Endurance as an intellectual virtue** -- "I was embarrassingly old when I figured out that endurance is an intellectual virtue... for the longest time I believed that the way to tell you were good at solving problems was that you figured out all the answers right away." Polya: "Lukewarm determination... may be enough to solve a routine problem in the classroom. But, to solve a serious scientific problem, willpower is needed that can outlast years of toil and bitter disappointments." ([Source](../content/books/mr-and-mrs-psmith-s-bookshelf/2026-01-12-review-how-to-solve-it-by-george-p-lya.md))

- **Ancient geniuses lacked "training data"** -- Psmith argues that Aristotle and other ancients failed to progress faster not due to lack of intelligence but because they lacked examples of high-quality reasoning to model their own thinking upon. ([Source](../content/books/mr-and-mrs-psmith-s-bookshelf/2026-01-12-review-how-to-solve-it-by-george-p-lya.md))

- **A major debut novel was never "shopped around"** -- Despite her agent's advice, Madeline Cash refused to submit to multiple publishers after finding her dream editor, departing radically from standard practice. ([Source](../content/books/book-gossip/2026-01-13-how-madeline-cash-got-her-book-deal.md))

- **American driving tests are shockingly basic** -- Oliver quotes Reddit users confirming his experience: "Just had to drive straight and make a few left and right turns and then had to park again at the DMV." ([Source](../content/books/henry-oliver-from-the-common-reader/2026-01-13-driving-like-a-video-game.md))

- **American suburban life is surprisingly convenient** -- Oliver finds libraries open until 8 PM ("good luck with that in London") and discovers thrift stores full of treasures, including "an old Brooks Brothers rain coat with attachable wool lining." ([Source](../content/books/henry-oliver-from-the-common-reader/2026-01-13-driving-like-a-video-game.md))

- **Swift as the most intelligent English writer** -- A bold claim positioning the Gulliver's Travels author above more commonly celebrated literary figures. ([Source](../content/books/henry-oliver-from-the-common-reader/2026-01-14-bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries-in-2026.md))

## Patterns and Trends

This week's books newsletters reveal several underlying currents in contemporary literary discourse:

**1. The return of "big ideas" book reviews**: The Psmith piece demonstrates how a book review can be a vehicle for original philosophical argument, not merely summary and evaluation. This represents a tradition of literary criticism as itself creative work.

**2. Demystification of publishing**: Madeline Cash's candid interview, including the acknowledgment that her path was "really unprecedented" and involved luck and stubbornness rather than reproducible strategy, offers refreshing honesty about an industry often surrounded by mystique.

**3. Transatlantic perspectives**: British writers observing America (and Americans) provide valuable outsider commentary on cultural assumptions. The genre of "Englishman observes American life" has a long tradition (de Tocqueville, though French; Dickens; etc.) and remains productive.

**4. The intellectual heritage question**: Both the Polya review and the Oliver anniversaries piece grapple with how we inherit and build upon previous intellectual work. This feels timely in an era of AI and questions about what knowledge can be transmitted.

**5. Political engagement**: Even in the "books" category, contemporary politics intrudes through the Max Read conversation. Literary figures increasingly feel compelled to engage directly with current events.

**6. The near-total absence of new book coverage**: Only the Book Gossip newsletter covers current releases and publishing deals. The other newsletters use books as springboards for broader intellectual exploration rather than as objects of review in themselves.

The week's reading suggests a literary culture caught between celebration of tradition (Bacon, Swift, Smith; Polya's enduring wisdom) and recognition that success often comes through unconventional means (Cash's warehouse party approach to publishing).
