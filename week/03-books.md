## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Debut Fiction and the Publishing Industry
**Coverage:** [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2), [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KEVT7H4P417X1ZMAYEKB3W4J_3)

The week featured substantial coverage of debut authors and the mechanics of getting published. [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2) ran an extensive interview with Madeline Cash about her path to publishing *Lost Lambs*, a "mordant yet affectionate Franzen-esque family story" that has already sold rights in 15 territories.

> "I kind of begged him to read it. I don't think that he really wanted to, but he did. Thank God. We didn't send it anywhere else. My agent said, 'It is kind of traditional to shop it around,' but I was like, 'No.'" — [Madeline Cash via Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2)

Cash's unconventional approach included stalking her editor to a warehouse party in Chinatown and pitching her book as "The Corrections meets Eyes Wide Shut." Her candid reflection on the process:

> "This is not an instruction manual for a debut writer. I think that this was all really unprecedented. I got really lucky, and I was really stubborn. I don't think this is traditionally how people get published, and it's probably how people get restraining orders." — [Madeline Cash via Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2)

[Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KEVT7H4P417X1ZMAYEKB3W4J_3) highlighted several new releases including Karl Ove Knausgaard's *The School of Night*, Sara Levine's comedic debut *The Hitch*, and Deepa Anappara's *Last of Earth*, a tale of love and empire in 19th-century Tibet.

### 2. Literary Anniversaries in 2026
**Coverage:** [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries)

Henry Oliver at [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries) made a compelling case for the most significant literary anniversaries of 2026: the 400th anniversary of Francis Bacon's death, the 300th anniversary of *Gulliver's Travels*, and the 250th anniversary of *The Wealth of Nations*.

> "Bacon, Smith, and Swift share many qualities: they are all splendid prose writers; they are all interested in science, politics, and the future; they stand in a line of inheritance to each other." — [Henry Oliver, The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries)

Oliver argues these three writers represent an underappreciated tradition in English literature:

> "They represent a part of English literature that gets less attention outside the academy. They are not loved like Austen and Auden. But the essays, utopias, treatises, pamphlets, and philosophy of these three writers are as much literature as anything else." — [Henry Oliver, The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries)

### 3. International Affairs Through Literary Journalism
**Coverage:** [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-afllo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z), [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asxkd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yh), [Max Read](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXhyZWFkLnN1YnN0YWNrLmNvbS9wL3RhbGtpbmctbWlubmVhcG9saXMtdmVuZXp1ZWxhLWVsb24_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRMU5qazVOakVzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RRM09UTXpNQ3dpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TURjeE16TXdMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpreU9EY3pJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS4ySk9aWE0ycjdha1cyUEEwaWpJbGFLdG1ubXBLd0E4N3FjZ1FyQXBPbzgwIiwicCI6MTg0NTY5OTYxLCJzIjozOTI4NzMsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg0NzkzMzAsImV4cCI6MjA4NDA1NTMzMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.vjPBuJqxUtVwbG3v4w-xzMG_MTFr2Uaeu4VL4TZAssg?)

Multiple newsletters covered the intersection of literature, journalism, and international politics. [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-afllo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z) featured Amir Ahmadi Arian writing about Iran's communication blackout during antigovernment protests:

> "Since I left Iran in 2011, life in exile has been marked by 'a permanent anxiety, a compulsive worry about the safety of loved ones who are hard to reach.' Never is this feeling sharper than when the Iranian government shuts down the Internet and imposes a communication blackout." — [Amir Ahmadi Arian via The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-afllo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z)

[The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asxkd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yh) also covered Venezuela, with William Neuman examining how "the Venezuelan opposition leader courted US military intervention—but she did not get what she bargained for."

[The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-agykly-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yk) featured Helen Epstein discussing Derek Peterson's archival research on Idi Amin's Uganda, drawing parallels to contemporary political developments:

> "What alarmed me back then is now happening in the US: government officials routinely distort the truth, incite ethnic hatred, treat the legislature and the media with contempt, and appoint partisan judges, while security forces carry out arbitrary arrests, torture and kill people, and run amok in other countries." — [Helen Epstein via The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-agykly-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yk)

### 4. Poetry and Translation
**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aejyo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a), [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asxkd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yh)

[New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aejyo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a) promoted Emmanuel Hocquard's *Elegies*, translated by Cole Swensen, with praise from poet Peter Gizzi:

> "It is a major event to have Emmanuel Hocquard's masterwork available to a new audience.... The capacious voice of these poems conjures a layered presence where each perception feels far away in time and yet extraordinarily intimate and direct." — [Peter Gizzi via New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aejyo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a)

The newsletter also marked the 135th birthday of Osip Mandelstam by republishing Robert Lowell and Olga Andreyev Carlisle's translations of nine of his last poems, written while in exile.

### 5. Science Fiction and Genre Recommendations
**Coverage:** [Max Read](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXhyZWFkLnN1YnN0YWNrLmNvbS9wL2EtdG9tLWNsYW5jeS1tZWV0cy1qZWZmLXZhbmRlcm1lZXI_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRM056VTJNVGtzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RjME1EYzFNeXdpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TXpNeU56VXpMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpreU9EY3pJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS5ibDJINzRHYnA3bDVPMkxna3NwdkEwQnhud0dkcDItWDB1SFZuNXdGb0ZFIiwicCI6MTg0Nzc1NjE5LCJzIjozOTI4NzMsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg3NDA3NTMsImV4cCI6MjA4NDMxNjc1MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.AiiTNb3tERRKRlqoGIsq1IXI2HhWeGkI-arUIwBfRAw?), [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2)

Wilson's *Hole in the Sky*, describing it as "an extremely propulsive first-contact thriller" that combines Tom Clancy-style technical detail with Jeff VanderMeer-esque cosmic horror:

> "Wilson, a Cherokee citizen, subtly handles the irony of a first contact novel set among contemporary Native Americans and wields Native mythology deftly. An excellent, fast read." — [Max Read](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXhyZWFkLnN1YnN0YWNrLmNvbS9wL2EtdG9tLWNsYW5jeS1tZWV0cy1qZWZmLXZhbmRlcm1lZXI_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRM056VTJNVGtzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RjME1EYzFNeXdpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TXpNeU56VXpMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpreU9EY3pJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS5ibDJINzRHYnA3bDVPMkxna3NwdkEwQnhud0dkcDItWDB1SFZuNXdGb0ZFIiwicCI6MTg0Nzc1NjE5LCJzIjozOTI4NzMsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg3NDA3NTMsImV4cCI6MjA4NDMxNjc1MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.AiiTNb3tERRKRlqoGIsq1IXI2HhWeGkI-arUIwBfRAw?)

[Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2) reviewed Knausgaard's *The School of Night*, noting that "Being in this narrator's head is exhausting; thankfully, at various points over the book's 500 pages, it tips into being hilarious."

### 6. Indian Literature and Amit Chaudhuri
**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aetrz-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jh)

[New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aetrz-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jh) featured a spotlight on Amit Chaudhuri, promoting his essay collection *Incompleteness* and novels *The Immortals* and *A New World*. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is quoted praising his work as "Unbelievably beautiful; I like to dip in and out, a few pages at a time, letting the words nurture me."

### 7. Marilynne Robinson on the Bible
**Coverage:** [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-astujd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p)

[The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-astujd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p) announced two new seminars by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Marilynne Robinson on the Old Testament (starting March 2026) and New Testament (starting May 2026).

> "The course as a whole is intended to draw attention to the fact that the Scriptures are, whatever else, a very great literature. Considering their importance to Western Civilization, it is remarkable how vulnerable they are now to misuse and ridicule." — [Marilynne Robinson via The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-astujd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p)

### 8. History and Urban Studies
**Coverage:** [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-avkijd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z)

[The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-avkijd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z) featured Willa Glickman examining the history of New York City cemeteries, noting that "Protecting graves in New York City has never been easy." The newsletter also covered Amish Raj Mulmi on Nepal's youth movement and its attempts to address postrevolutionary inequities, and revisited Janet Adam Smith's classic essay on A.A. Milne and the world of Pooh:

> "The world of the Pooh stories is wild and anarchic—though never violent and never really dangerous. There are no fixed routines, no nursery rules." — [Janet Adam Smith via The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-avkijd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z)

### 9. Book Industry and Retail News
**Coverage:** [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KF6Q2WRJQEMHJXN3N636EMWK_3), [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2)

[Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KF6Q2WRJQEMHJXN3N636EMWK_3) highlighted the continued dominance of Rachel Reid's *Game Changers* hockey romance series on their bestsellers list and announced a new book in the series for September. They also promoted an Agatha Christie ebook sale tied to Netflix's adaptation of *The Seven Dials Mystery*, and noted increased interest in Emily Wilson's translation of *The Odyssey* ahead of Christopher Nolan's upcoming film adaptation.

[Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2) noted that "we are perhaps living in the golden era of reissues," pointing to the work of small press editors in bringing out-of-print books back to readers.

### 10. American Life Through British Eyes
**Coverage:** [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/driving-like-a-video-game)

Henry Oliver at [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/driving-like-a-video-game) offered wry observations on American driving culture from a British perspective, noting that "American drivers in this part of Virginia are generally uninterested in one another's need to change lanes and make turns. Many of them drive like they are in a video game."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**International Politics Through Literary Lenses:** Both [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-afllo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z) and [Max Read](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXhyZWFkLnN1YnN0YWNrLmNvbS9wL3RhbGtpbmctbWlubmVhcG9saXMtdmVuZXp1ZWxhLWVsb24_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRMU5qazVOakVzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RRM09UTXpNQ3dpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TURjeE16TXdMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpreU9EY3pJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS4ySk9aWE0ycjdha1cyUEEwaWpJbGFLdG1ubXBLd0E4N3FjZ1FyQXBPbzgwIiwicCI6MTg0NTY5OTYxLCJzIjozOTI4NzMsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg0NzkzMzAsImV4cCI6MjA4NDA1NTMzMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.vjPBuJqxUtVwbG3v4w-xzMG_MTFr2Uaeu4VL4TZAssg?) covered Venezuela and geopolitical concerns, though from different angles—the former through formal literary journalism, the latter through podcast discussion and political commentary.

**The Publishing Process Demystified:** [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2) and [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KEVT7H4P417X1ZMAYEKB3W4J_3) both focused on debut writers and the path to publication, with Book Gossip providing insider perspective and Bookshop.org highlighting which debuts are hitting shelves.

**Intellectual History and Contemporary Relevance:** [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries) examined older texts (Bacon, Swift, and Smith anniversaries) for their continued relevance to contemporary thinking.

**Global Literature:** Multiple sources highlighted non-Western and translated literature: [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aetrz-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jh) on Amit Chaudhuri's Indian fiction, [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aejyo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a) on French poetry, and [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KF40FVDNVX19XH2R03RABYK8_6) on Deepa Anappara's novel set in Tibet.

**Adaptation Culture:** [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KF6Q2WRJQEMHJXN3N636EMWK_3) tracked multiple screen adaptations including Christopher Nolan's upcoming *Odyssey* film and Netflix's Agatha Christie series, demonstrating how books newsletters increasingly serve as bridges between literary and visual culture.

## Surprising or Contrarian Perspectives

**On Publishing Conventions:** Madeline Cash's admission that she essentially stalked her editor to a party and refused to shop her book around challenges conventional wisdom about how to get published.

**On Historical Archives:** [Helen Epstein via The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-agykly-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yk) notes that Idi Amin's archives were "virtually cleansed of evidence of state-sponsored atrocities," raising questions about whether we can ever truly understand violent regimes through documentary evidence.

**On Political Parallels:** Epstein's direct comparison of African despotism to contemporary American politics represents a stark and provocative framing rarely seen in mainstream literary journalism.

**On Non-Fiction as Literature:** [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries) argues that "the essays, utopias, treatises, pamphlets, and philosophy" of writers like Bacon, Swift, and Smith deserve as much literary attention as novels—a counterpoint to fiction-centric literary culture.
