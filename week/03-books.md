## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Intelligence, Problem-Solving, and the Question of AI
**Coverage:** [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/review-how-to-solve-it-by-george?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app)

The week's most intellectually ambitious piece was a sprawling review of George Polya's classic "How to Solve It," which transformed into a meditation on the nature of intelligence itself. The reviewer argues provocatively against both those who deny innate intelligence differences and those who treat intelligence as immutable:

> "Some people are just smarter than others. It offends every notion of fairness we have, fills the privileged with guilt and the overlooked with rage... We fear that admitting it would open the door to countless horrors." -- [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/review-how-to-solve-it-by-george?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app)

The piece pivots to argue that intelligence can be meaningfully enhanced through systematic problem-solving methodologies, redefining intelligence as "the ability of an agent to achieve its goals." Drawing on Polya's four-stage framework (understanding the problem, forming a plan, executing the plan, reflecting), the essay catalogues a toolkit of heuristics for becoming a more effective thinker. The reviewer argues that "endurance is an intellectual virtue" and that willpower to persevere through setbacks matters as much as raw cognitive ability.

The essay concludes with implications for AI, suggesting that language models trained on high-quality reasoning examples may be acquiring something closer to genuine problem-solving ability than skeptics acknowledge:

> "A lot of human intelligence is also just 'cleverness'... the more training examples you feed them, the smarter they are... it's the thing that Aristotle and the other ancients were missing. Reams and reams of examples, not of solutions to particular problems, but of exceptional problem-solving itself." -- [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/review-how-to-solve-it-by-george?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app)

### 2. The Publishing Industry: Debuts and Book Deals
**Coverage:** [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2), [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KEVT7H4P417X1ZMAYEKB3W4J_3)

[Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2) featured an unusually candid interview with debut novelist Madeline Cash about her path to publishing "Lost Lambs." Cash's story subverts traditional publishing advice: she stalked her dream editor at a party, refused to shop her manuscript around, and landed a deal with FSG on the strength of personal initiative. Her frank assessment:

> "This is not an instruction manual for a debut writer. I think that this was all really unprecedented. I got really lucky, and I was really stubborn. I don't think this is traditionally how people get published, and it's probably how people get restraining orders." -- [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2)

Cash described calling her novel "The Corrections meets Eyes Wide Shut," quitting her job as head copywriter for Jack in the Box after the sale ("I was supposed to write 500 headlines for a new kind of soft taco. It wasn't that I had made a bunch of money, I just was like, 'I'm done now. I have to be done.'"), and the peculiar anxiety of having her book published years after she wrote it.

The newsletter also highlighted Karl Ove Knausgaard's new novel "The School of Night," describing it as exhausting but ultimately rewarding:

> "Being in this narrator's head is exhausting; thankfully, at various points over the book's 500 pages, it tips into being hilarious." -- [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2)

[Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KEVT7H4P417X1ZMAYEKB3W4J_3) promoted multiple new releases including Sara Levine's comedic debut about exorcising a corgi's ghost and Deepa Anappara's Tibet-set historical fiction.

**Coverage:** [New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-afllo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z), [New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asxkd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yh), [New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-agykly-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yk), [Max Read](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXhyZWFkLnN1YnN0YWNrLmNvbS9wL3RhbGtpbmctbWlubmVhcG9saXMtdmVuZXp1ZWxhLWVsb24_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRMU5qazVOakVzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RRM09UTXpNQ3dpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TURjeE16TXdMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpreU9EY3pJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS4ySk9aWE0ycjdha1cyUEEwaWpJbGFLdG1ubXBLd0E4N3FjZ1FyQXBPbzgwIiwicCI6MTg0NTY5OTYxLCJzIjozOTI4NzMsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg0NzkzMzAsImV4cCI6MjA4NDA1NTMzMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.vjPBuJqxUtVwbG3v4w-xzMG_MTFr2Uaeu4VL4TZAssg?)

The [New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-afllo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z) provided extensive coverage of multiple international crises:

**Iran's Internet Blackout:** Amir Ahmadi Arian wrote movingly about the terror of communication blackouts imposed during anti-government protests:

> "Since I left Iran in 2011, life in exile has been marked by 'a permanent anxiety, a compulsive worry about the safety of loved ones who are hard to reach.' Never is this feeling sharper than when the Iranian government shuts down the Internet." -- [New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-afllo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-z)

**Venezuela:** [NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asxkd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yh) assessed the costs to Venezuela's opposition of courting US military intervention, while [Max Read](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXhyZWFkLnN1YnN0YWNrLmNvbS9wL3RhbGtpbmctbWlubmVhcG9saXMtdmVuZXp1ZWxhLWVsb24_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRMU5qazVOakVzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RRM09UTXpNQ3dpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TURjeE16TXdMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpreU9EY3pJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS4ySk9aWE0ycjdha1cyUEEwaWpJbGFLdG1ubXBLd0E4N3FjZ1FyQXBPbzgwIiwicCI6MTg0NTY5OTYxLCJzIjozOTI4NzMsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg0NzkzMzAsImV4cCI6MjA4NDA1NTMzMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.vjPBuJqxUtVwbG3v4w-xzMG_MTFr2Uaeu4VL4TZAssg?) discussed the "abduction of Nicolas Maduro and the increasingly bellicosity of the Trump administration."

**Uganda:** In a striking interview with Helen Epstein about her review of "A Popular History of Idi Amin's Uganda," [NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-agykly-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yk) drew alarming parallels between African despotism and current American politics:

> "What alarmed me back then is now happening in the US: government officials routinely distort the truth, incite ethnic hatred, treat the legislature and the media with contempt, and appoint partisan judges, while security forces carry out arbitrary arrests, torture and kill people, and run amok in other countries." -- [New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-agykly-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yk)

Epstein noted the difficulty of understanding despotic regimes through their archives, since "the archives had been virtually cleansed of evidence of state-sponsored atrocities." When asked about the tendency to repress historical horrors, she concluded: "I think we need a psychoanalyst to figure this one out."

### 4. Literary Anniversaries of 2026
**Coverage:** [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries)

Henry Oliver at [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries) highlighted three major literary anniversaries for 2026: the 400th anniversary of Francis Bacon's death, the 300th anniversary of Gulliver's Travels, and the 250th anniversary of The Wealth of Nations. Oliver argues these works represent an underappreciated tradition in English letters:

> "Swift is perhaps the most intelligent writer in the English canon. Bacon has many turns of phrase that are as vivid and memorable as those of the great poets. Smith is a splendid writer who uses details and stories in his work in ways that he clearly learned from novelists." -- [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries)

Oliver notes that "the literary anniversaries that get the most attention tend to be centenaries and novels" while these three anniversaries "point to a more rational, discursive, and argumentative tradition in English literature."

---

### 5. Poetry in Translation
**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aejyo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a), [New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asxkd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yh)

[New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aejyo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a) featured Emmanuel Hocquard's "Elegies" in Cole Swensen's translation, describing the work as lying "at the core of his oeuvre, one of the most admired in contemporary French poetry." The newsletter distinguishes between two types of elegiac poet:

> "The classic ruminates on the past; the inverse remakes it. Hocquard is an inverse elegiac poet: Rich with the past, his poems lead us into an ever-expanding present." -- [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aejyo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a)

The NYRB also published translations of nine poems by Osip Mandelstam, marking the 135th anniversary of his birth, including this haunting line:

> "Preserve my words forever for their aftertaste of misfortune and smoke, for their tar of collective patience and conscientious work." -- [New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asxkd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yh)

### 6. American Suburban Life and Cultural Observation
**Coverage:** [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/driving-like-a-video-game)

Henry Oliver's [dispatch from Virginia](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/driving-like-a-video-game) offered sardonic observations on American suburban life, particularly driving culture:

> "American drivers in this part of Virginia are generally uninterested in one another's need to change lanes and make turns. Many of them drive like they are in a video game, as if there are points for being closer to the next red light." -- [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/driving-like-a-video-game)

The piece captures the peculiar convenience and alienation of American suburban sprawl through the eyes of a British transplant, noting that "in this part of Virginia, there are no towns" -- only "roads and car parks and clusters of shops."

### 7. Featured Authors and NYRB Promotions
**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aetrz-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jh), [New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-astujd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p)

[NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aetrz-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jh) promoted the works of Amit Chaudhuri, describing him as "one of the most singular voices in contemporary letters." His essay collection "Incompleteness" was praised for being "skeptical, alert, often trenchant, allergic to cant." Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie praised his novel "A New World":

> "Unbelievably beautiful; I like to dip in and out, a few pages at a time, letting the words nurture me." -- [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aetrz-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jh)

[NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-astujd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p) also announced new seminars by Marilynne Robinson on the Bible, framing the Scriptures as "a very great literature" that deserves reclamation from "cynical use" and "neglect":

> "Considering their importance to Western Civilization, it is remarkable how vulnerable they are now to misuse and ridicule. Over centuries writers returned to these texts, confident of finding a high order of meaning in them." -- [New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-astujd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p)

### 8. Romance and Genre Fiction Trends
**Coverage:** [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KF6Q2WRJQEMHJXN3N636EMWK_3), [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2)

[Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KF6Q2WRJQEMHJXN3N636EMWK_3) reported that Rachel Reid's "Game Changer" hockey romance series continues to dominate bestseller lists, with a seventh book featuring Ilya Rozanov and Shane Hollander announced for September. The newsletter also promoted an Agatha Christie ebook sale tied to Netflix's "The Seven Dials Mystery" adaptation and highlighted Emily Wilson's translation of "The Odyssey" ahead of Christopher Nolan's film adaptation.

[Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2) noted the expansion of the Hollander-Rozanov universe and proclaimed we are "perhaps living in the golden era of reissues."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Political Pessimism:** Both [NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-agykly-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yk) and [Max Read](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXhyZWFkLnN1YnN0YWNrLmNvbS9wL3RhbGtpbmctbWlubmVhcG9saXMtdmVuZXp1ZWxhLWVsb24_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRMU5qazVOakVzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RRM09UTXpNQ3dpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TURjeE16TXdMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpreU9EY3pJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS4ySk9aWE0ycjdha1cyUEEwaWpJbGFLdG1ubXBLd0E4N3FjZ1FyQXBPbzgwIiwicCI6MTg0NTY5OTYxLCJzIjozOTI4NzMsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg0NzkzMzAsImV4cCI6MjA4NDA1NTMzMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.vjPBuJqxUtVwbG3v4w-xzMG_MTFr2Uaeu4VL4TZAssg?) expressed deep concern about current American political developments, with Epstein drawing explicit parallels to African despotism and Max Read discussing the "siege of Minneapolis."

**International Focus:** Multiple sources covered Venezuela this week, with [NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asxkd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yh) offering analysis and [Max Read](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXhyZWFkLnN1YnN0YWNrLmNvbS9wL3RhbGtpbmctbWlubmVhcG9saXMtdmVuZXp1ZWxhLWVsb24_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RRMU5qazVOakVzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RRM09UTXpNQ3dpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TURjeE16TXdMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpreU9EY3pJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS4ySk9aWE0ycjdha1cyUEEwaWpJbGFLdG1ubXBLd0E4N3FjZ1FyQXBPbzgwIiwicCI6MTg0NTY5OTYxLCJzIjozOTI4NzMsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg0NzkzMzAsImV4cCI6MjA4NDA1NTMzMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.vjPBuJqxUtVwbG3v4w-xzMG_MTFr2Uaeu4VL4TZAssg?) discussing it on their podcast.

**The Past as Resource:** Both [The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/bacon-swift-smith-three-anniversaries) and [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/review-how-to-solve-it-by-george?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app) emphasized the contemporary relevance of historical texts, whether 18th-century philosophy or mid-20th-century mathematics pedagogy.

**Adaptation Culture:** [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KF6Q2WRJQEMHJXN3N636EMWK_3) highlighted Christopher Nolan's upcoming "Odyssey" adaptation and Netflix's Agatha Christie series, continuing the pattern of books newsletters tracking screen adaptations.

**Commercial vs. Literary Divide:** The newsletters showed a clear split between [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KEVT7H4P417X1ZMAYEKB3W4J_3)'s promotional focus on romance and genre fiction versus [NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aejyo-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a)'s emphasis on translated literary works and critical essays.

## Surprising or Contrarian Takes

- [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/review-how-to-solve-it-by-george?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app) argues that "more of human intelligence than we want to admit is actually just" pattern matching against previously seen problems, potentially validating AI capabilities.

- [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28pwql1.12ut/d3bb1ab2) presents Madeline Cash's unconventional publishing path as potentially replicable, despite her own disclaimers.

- [NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-agykly-36F2A313-iruduywlh-yk) draws stark parallels between Ugandan despotism and current American governance, suggesting "we need a psychoanalyst to figure this one out."
