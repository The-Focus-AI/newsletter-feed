Dr. Jay Cordeira's daily forecasts tracked multiple rounds of snow throughout the week, with cold air finally returning to New England. The week featured "tricky" forecasting conditions with multiple weather systems interacting:

> "Will the storm track farther west, slow down the progression of the cold front with the first player and bring more rain into portions of the coastal plain? Maybe. Will the storm be weaker and/or track farther east, allowing for the cold front with the first player to move through quicker, but with overall less precipitation? Maybe." -- [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42340?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

Thursday's post-storm analysis revealed the forecast had "diverged slightly from consensus" with the low pressure tracking farther west than anticipated:

> "The tricky forecast that we were following for New England did, in fact, diverge slightly from consensus. Rain did go over to snow on Wednesday night across the region; however, the low pressure responsible for the rain ended up going farther west than anticipated." -- [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42360?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

The extended forecast calls for persistently cold temperatures through the MLK holiday weekend and beyond:

> "The forecast turns colder over the next two weeks with limited prospects for widespread heavy snowfall. The pattern instead supports plenty of light, scattered, and upslope snow showers." -- [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42372?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

### 2. Saturday's Surprising Snow and Coastal Storm

**Coverage:** [OpenSnow - Weekend Update](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42407?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

Saturday's snow exceeded expectations, delivering more accumulation than forecast. [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42407?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026) reported:

> "Snow on Saturday ended up coming in a bit stronger than anticipated -- well, at least stronger than *I* anticipated. Most of the forcing for the snowfall ended up focused across portions of central and southwest New England where >8 inches of snow was reported in southern Vermont and the Berkshires." -- [Dr. Jay Cordeira, OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42407?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

Sunday brought a coastal storm tracking north along the coast, though it primarily affected southern New England:

> "This storm is really a southern New England special with limited snow expected across portion of western/northern New England... Vermont is likely going to miss out." -- [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42407?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

### 3. Extreme Cold Warning for Next Week

**Coverage:** [OpenSnow - Quiet Week Ahead](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42422?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

By week's end, [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42422?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026) was warning of dangerous cold approaching:

> "The latest forecast for the mountains (e.g., Killington and Jay Peak below) is for windchill temperatures between -55F and -25F on Friday (24 Jan) through Monday (26 Jan). If this forecast verifies, we'll likely see a couple resorts take actions around potential cold exposure." -- [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42422?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

Dr. Cordeira expressed hope that the forecast might moderate:

> "I actually hope that the forecast is wrong and that we see some walk-back/moderation over the next several days... It's not fun skiing with air temperatures of -20F to -10F and windchills below -30F; it's quite the opposite." -- [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42422?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

The week ahead is expected to be quiet with light snow chances (1-2 inches on Tuesday and Thursday mornings), while a potential Mid-Atlantic storm on Sunday January 25 is being tracked but currently expected to stay south of New England.

### 4. Regional Winter Season Assessment

**Coverage:** [OpenSnow Winter Update](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html), [OpenSnow Cold Temperatures](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html)

The broader 2025-2026 winter season has shown stark regional contrasts:

> "As of mid-January, the winter of 2025-2026 has been a rough one across much of the Western United States. However, it has been an excellent season across the Canadian Rockies and Eastern North America." -- [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html)

The pattern analysis draws comparisons to the 2017-2018 winter season. [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html) also highlighted the Japan powder season: "Japanuary is on, and the storms are lining up for the next ten days."

### 5. OpenSnow AI and Forecast Features

**Coverage:** [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html)

[OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html) announced a new AI-powered feature providing written summaries for ski resorts globally:

> "The human forecasters at OpenSnow can't cover all places at all times, so we created written summaries with our forecast data using AI to provide an easy-to-digest overview of what skiers or riders will likely experience on the mountain." -- [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html)

The company also demonstrated forecast transparency by publishing verification of their January 7 predictions, acknowledging they "under-forecasted by 19% against the total snowfall."
