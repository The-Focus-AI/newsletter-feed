## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. New England Winter Weather and Ski Conditions
**Coverage:** [OpenSnow (Jan 13)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42321), [OpenSnow (Jan 14 - Daily)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42340), [OpenSnow (Jan 14 - East)](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html), [OpenSnow (Jan 15)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42360), [OpenSnow (Jan 16 - Daily)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42372), [OpenSnow (Jan 16 - Winter Update)](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html)

The week began with fresh snow from Monday night dropping 1-4 inches across the North Country, with Jay Peak (VT) leading at 4 inches. [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42321) forecasted a more significant event Wednesday night through Thursday with "6+ inch total snows possible in the northern Greens and Whites."

By Wednesday, meteorologist Dr. Jay Cordeira acknowledged the forecast complexity, describing it as a "tricky forecast" with multiple possible outcomes. He outlined the interplay between a cold front and a developing low pressure system:

> "Will the storm track farther west, slow down the progression of the cold front with the first player and bring more rain into portions of the coastal plain? Maybe. Will the storm be weaker and/or track farther east, allowing for the cold front with the first player to move through quicker, but with overall less precipitation? Maybe." — [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42340)

Thursday's post-storm analysis revealed the forecast had "diverged slightly from consensus" with the low pressure tracking farther west than anticipated, resulting in "a little more rain, a little less snow." However, Vermont resorts still reported 2-6 inches, with Sugarbush topping the list at 6 inches.

By Friday, [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42372) reported Cannon with 8 inches and confirmed a sustained cold pattern ahead:

> "The forecast turns colder over the next two weeks with limited prospects for widespread heavy snowfall. The pattern instead supports plenty of light, scattered, and upslope snow showers." — [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42372)

The coastal storm hype for Sunday night was walked back significantly: "Chances for a significant event are not zero, but they are much closer to zero than 100%."

### 2. 2025-2026 Winter Season Analysis
**Coverage:** [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html)

[OpenSnow's](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html) mid-January seasonal analysis revealed a stark regional divide:

> "As of mid-January, the winter of 2025-2026 has been a rough one across much of the Western United States. However, it has been an excellent season across the Canadian Rockies and Eastern North America." — [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html)

The newsletter drew comparisons to the 2017-2018 winter and offered insights on what the second half of the season may bring.

> "Japanuary is on, and the storms are lining up for the next ten days... if you were wondering when to pull the trigger for that Japan trip, now is the time." — [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html)

### 4. OpenSnow AI Overview Feature
**Coverage:** [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html)

[OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html) announced a new AI-powered feature providing written summaries for ski resorts globally:

> "The human forecasters at OpenSnow can't cover all places at all times, so we created written summaries with our forecast data using AI to provide an easy-to-digest overview of what skiers or riders will likely experience on the mountain." — [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html)

### 5. Forecast Verification Transparency
**Coverage:** [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html)

[OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html) demonstrated notable forecast transparency by publishing verification of their January 7 five-day snowfall forecast:

> "We looked back at the 5-day snow forecast from January 7, 2026, to compare against how much snow fell through January 11, 2025, at popular ski resorts with reliable snow reporting data. The result? We under-forecasted by 19% against the total snowfall." — [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html)
