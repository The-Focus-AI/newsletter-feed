# Week 03 Personal Newsletter Analysis (January 12-17, 2026)

## Overview

This week's personal newsletters were dominated by two major themes: winter weather in New England and significant changes at Microsoft. The OpenSnow meteorological forecasts tracked a dynamic week for skiers in the Northeast as the January thaw ended and colder temperatures returned with multiple snow events. Meanwhile, Tom Warren's Notepad newsletter from The Verge delivered substantial news about Microsoft's corporate cost-cutting measures, including the closure of its employee library and a shift toward AI-powered learning resources.

Beyond weather and tech, the week included website analytics updates from Plausible, local food service news from Warren General Store in Connecticut, and streaming recommendations from Connecticut Public's PBS Passport service. The analytics reports showed strong growth for thefocus.ai (up 160% in visitors) while willschenk.com maintained steady traffic driven primarily by technical how-to content about Claude Code and Emacs.

## Major Topics and Stories

### New England Winter Weather Progression

**Covered by:** OpenSnow (8 separate reports)

The week began with the end of the January thaw and saw multiple snow events across New England. Meteorologist Jay Cordeira provided daily updates tracking a complex weather pattern.

**Key developments:**
- **January 12**: Winter returned with the thaw ending. "The Mt. Mansfield snow stake did drop back to 60 inches over the weekend, but returned to 63 inches on Sunday. The snow depth is still far above average for this time of year." - *Dr. Jay Cordeira, OpenSnow*
- **January 13**: Light snow dropped 1-4 inches across the North Country with Jay Peak receiving 4 inches
- **January 14**: A "tricky forecast" developed with rain-to-snow transitions. The forecast was complicated by two weather systems potentially merging
- **January 15**: Verification showed the forecast "did, in fact, diverge slightly from consensus" with more rain and less snow than expected. Sugarbush topped reports with 6 inches
- **January 16**: Cold pattern established with limited heavy snowfall prospects but favorable conditions for snowmaking

**Notable forecasting insight:** "It's worth noting that the AI version of the ECMWF ensemble is a major buzzkill. I'm cautious here (i.e., pessimistic) given the AI model is leaning against the dynamical models." - *Dr. Jay Cordeira, January 12*

**Seasonal context from January 16 outlook:** "As of mid-January, the winter of 2025-2026 has been a rough one across much of the Western United States. However, it has been an excellent season across the Canadian Rockies and Eastern North America."

### Microsoft Corporate Changes and AI Pivot

**Covered by:** Tom Warren's Notepad (The Verge)

Microsoft is making significant changes to employee resources, replacing traditional information services with AI-powered alternatives.

**Key story - Library Closure:**
"Microsoft's library of books is so heavy that it once caused a campus building to sink, according to an unproven legend among employees. Now those physical books, journals, and reports, and many of Microsoft's digital subscriptions to leading US newspapers, are disappearing in a shift described inside Microsoft as an 'AI-powered learning experience.'" - *Tom Warren*

The Strategic News Service (SNS), which provided reports to Microsoft's 220,000 employees for over 20 years, has been cut. SNS responded critically: "Technology's future is shaped by flows of power, money, innovation, and people -- none of which are predictable based on LLMs' probabilistic regurgitation of old information." - *Berit Anderson, COO of Strategic News Service*

**Additional Microsoft news:**
- UK police (West Midlands) blamed Microsoft Copilot for an intelligence error that led to Israeli football fans being banned from a match
- Microsoft announced "Community-First AI Infrastructure" plan to address concerns about data center impacts
- Office Lens app being retired (functionality moved to OneDrive)
- Copilot adding buy buttons for in-app purchases
- PC shipments grew 10% in Q4 2025 amid RAM shortage concerns
- Microsoft, Meta, Amazon paying for "enterprise" Wikipedia access

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### AI Integration and Its Discontents

Two newsletters this week touched on AI from different angles, revealing tension between AI adoption and traditional expertise:

**OpenSnow** uses AI positively through their PEAKS model (described as "up to 50% more accurate in mountain terrain") but noted that AI weather models sometimes conflict with traditional forecasting: "the AI version of the ECMWF ensemble is a major buzzkill."

**Tom Warren's Notepad** reported on AI replacing human-curated knowledge at Microsoft, with critics arguing AI cannot replace strategic intelligence. The UK police Copilot error story further highlighted risks of uncritical AI reliance.

### Regional Focus on New England/Connecticut

Multiple newsletters served this geographic area:
- OpenSnow's daily New England forecasts
- Warren General Store (Warren, CT)
- Connecticut Public (Hartford, CT)

This suggests a subscriber with strong ties to the Connecticut/Vermont corridor.

## Surprising or Notable Insights

1. **AI models disagreeing with traditional forecasting**: OpenSnow's Dr. Jay Cordeira noted that AI weather models were more conservative than traditional dynamical models, leading him to temper expectations - an interesting case of a professional being cautious about AI predictions in his own field.

2. **Microsoft library legend**: The detail that Microsoft's old library was so heavy with books that it allegedly caused Building 4 to sink (with parking garage pillars cracking) is a fascinating piece of corporate history being lost as the library closes.

3. **Strategic News Service's sharp criticism**: A vendor publicly criticizing a major client like Microsoft is unusual, suggesting real frustration with the AI-first pivot: calling LLMs "probabilistic regurgitation of old information."

4. **Japan ski season timing**: OpenSnow's note that "Japanuary is on" with major storm cycles lining up suggests this is the optimal window for Japan ski trips.

5. **Claude Code content driving traffic**: The top-performing content on willschenk.com was about using Claude Code in Emacs, indicating strong interest in AI coding tools among technical audiences.

6. **PBS featuring LGBTQ+ narratives**: Both new PBS shows highlighted (Bookish and A Mother Apart) prominently feature LGBTQ+ storylines, reflecting continued mainstream inclusion.
