**Coverage:** [OpenSnow - Winter Returns](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42299?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026), [OpenSnow - BC/Alberta Update](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-12/index.html), [OpenSnow - More Snow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42321?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026), [OpenSnow - Tricky Forecast](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42340?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026), [OpenSnow - Turning Colder](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42360?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026), [OpenSnow - Cold Pattern](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42372?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026), [OpenSnow - Weekend Update](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42407?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

The January thaw officially ended across New England, with winter conditions returning in full force. Dr. Jay Cordeira's daily forecasts tracked multiple rounds of snow throughout the week, though accumulations varied widely by location.

> "The January thaw has come to an end across most of central and northern New England with minimal impact to the high-elevation snowpack across northern Vermont." -- [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42299?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

Key snowfall totals included 8-10 inches at Jay Peak early in the week, with subsequent storms bringing 2-6 inches across Vermont resorts. The Mt. Mansfield snow stake remained well above average at 63 inches. The week featured "tricky" forecasting conditions with multiple weather systems interacting:

> "Will the storm track farther west, slow down the progression of the cold front with the first player and bring more rain into portions of the coastal plain? Maybe. Will the storm be weaker and/or track farther east, allowing for the cold front with the first player to move through quicker, but with overall less precipitation? Maybe." -- [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42340?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

Thursday's post-storm analysis revealed the forecast had "diverged slightly from consensus" with the low pressure tracking farther west than anticipated:

> "The tricky forecast that we were following for New England did, in fact, diverge slightly from consensus. Rain did go over to snow on Wednesday night across the region; however, the low pressure responsible for the rain ended up going farther west than anticipated." -- [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42360?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

The extended forecast calls for persistently cold temperatures through the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend and into the following week, with temperatures struggling to reach the teens. While this limits powder prospects, it creates excellent snowmaking conditions.

> "The forecast turns colder over the next two weeks with limited prospects for widespread heavy snowfall. The pattern instead supports plenty of light, scattered, and upslope snow showers." -- [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42372?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

### 2. Saturday's Surprising Snow and Coastal Storm

**Coverage:** [OpenSnow - Weekend Update](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42407?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

Saturday's snow exceeded expectations, delivering more accumulation than forecast. [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42407?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026) reported:

> "Snow on Saturday ended up coming in a bit stronger than anticipated -- well, at least stronger than *I* anticipated. Most of the forcing for the snowfall ended up focused across portions of central and southwest New England where >8 inches of snow was reported in southern Vermont and the Berkshires." -- [Dr. Jay Cordeira, OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42407?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

Sunday brought a coastal storm tracking north along the coast, though it primarily affected southern New England:

> "This storm is really a southern New England special with limited snow expected across portion of western/northern New England... Vermont is likely going to miss out." -- [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42407?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

The forecast called for 3-6 inches over eastern Massachusetts and south of Boston, with 2-4 inches at Wachusett. Dr. Cordeira also noted the Patriots game in Foxborough would see light snow during game time (3PM-6PM), with heavier snow expected afterward from 7PM to midnight.

### 3. Regional Winter Season Assessment

**Coverage:** [OpenSnow Winter Update](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html), [OpenSnow Cold Temperatures](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html)

The broader 2025-2026 winter season has shown stark regional contrasts. While the Western United States has experienced disappointing conditions, Eastern North America and the Canadian Rockies have enjoyed an excellent season.

> "As of mid-January, the winter of 2025-2026 has been a rough one across much of the Western United States. However, it has been an excellent season across the Canadian Rockies and Eastern North America." -- [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html)

The pattern analysis draws comparisons to the 2017-2018 winter season. Looking ahead, the West is expected to remain dry until around January 20-23, while the East will continue to see cold temperatures with multiple snow opportunities.

[OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-16/index.html) also highlighted the Japan powder season, noting "Japanuary is on, and the storms are lining up for the next ten days" with a new Japan Daily Snow forecast launching Monday/Wednesday/Friday.

[OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html) announced a new AI-powered feature providing written summaries for ski resorts globally:

> "The human forecasters at OpenSnow can't cover all places at all times, so we created written summaries with our forecast data using AI to provide an easy-to-digest overview of what skiers or riders will likely experience on the mountain." -- [OpenSnow](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-14/index.html)

The company also demonstrated notable forecast transparency by publishing verification of their January 7 predictions, acknowledging they "under-forecasted by 19% against the total snowfall."

## Notable Insights

**Cold Pattern Duration**: The extended forecast suggests below-normal temperatures persisting through at least January 25, with the cold pattern favoring snowmaking over natural snowfall in the coming weeks. Slope-side temperatures at Killington are expected to drop to near or below 0F twice and remain below 20F over the next 15 days.

**Coastal Storm Deflation**: The Sunday night coastal storm hype was walked back significantly: "Chances for a significant event are not zero, but they are much closer to zero than 100%." The best chance for accumulating snow from this system will be on Cape Cod, where there are "exactly zero lift-serviced places to ski."

**Patriots Game Weather**: The Sunday NFL playoff game in Foxborough faced snowy conditions, with light snow expected during the 3PM-6PM game time and heavier snow forecast for 7PM-midnight afterward. Dr. Cordeira signed off with "Go Pats."
