# Week 03 Philosophy Newsletter Analysis (January 12-17, 2026)

## Overview

This week's philosophy newsletters oscillate between contemplating civilizational collapse and community building as responses to societal crisis. [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) provides historical perspective through the Bronze Age collapse and Roman leadership studies, while [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) and [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) offer sharply contrasting analyses of contemporary political radicalization and American foreign policy. A through-line emerges: the question of how societies maintain coherence when traditional structures fail.

## Major Topics and Stories

### Topic 1: Civilizational Collapse and What Causes It

**Coverage:**
- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) (Van Bryan): "When the World Collapsed: Lessons from 1177 BC"
- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag): "Kirk Killing: The Radical Right's Reichstag Fire"

**Van Bryan ([Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons))** opens with a striking thought experiment: "Imagine one day waking up to a world gone...dark. Suddenly there was no internet. No wifi or signal, no electricity, and no gas. Credit cards didn't work and banks were permanently closed."

He uses this to draw readers into the Bronze Age Collapse of 1177 BC, when multiple interconnected civilizations fell simultaneously:

> "Great kingdoms that had dominated for centuries, the Mycenaeans in Greece, the Hittites in Anatolia, the powers of Egypt and Mesopotamia, were shaken by a wave of destruction so vast that cities burned, trade routes vanished, and writing itself disappeared in some regions."

Bryan emphasizes the **mystery** of the collapse: "Earthquakes, invasions, internal revolts, famine, climate change, and the mysterious 'Sea Peoples' may all have played a role. But no single explanation tells the whole story." He notes that despite all scholarly efforts, "to this date we still don't know what happened exactly to the Bronze Age people."

For the Mycenaeans specifically, the collapse was total: "the end of palaces, the loss of literacy, and centuries of silence." Yet Bryan offers a redemptive note: "from those ashes would rise the myths that still shape us today: Achilles, Odysseus, Troy."

**Rod Dreher ([Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag))** approaches collapse through a different lens: the psychology of political extremism. Drawing from Laurence Rees's book *The Nazi Mind*, Dreher quotes:

> "One of the first things I learnt in my studies [of the Nazis] was that in order to understand why the Nazis possessed the mentalities they did, we must embrace the reality of a fundamental truth: we are all creatures of a particular time and a particular place."

Dreher argues against dismissing Weimar comparisons: "If we ever get fascism or communism in America, it won't come the way it came to Germany and Russia. It will come in an American way, through means particular to our own era. The thing to focus on is not a strict one-to-one comparison between Now and Then, but a more general one, meditating on the material, social, and cultural conditions that made the emergence of political extremism possible."

**Different Perspectives:** While **Bryan** ([Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons)) examines collapse as an archaeological/historical puzzle with multiple possible causes and emphasizes what we don't know, **Dreher** ([Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag)) is more concerned with the psychological and social preconditions that make collapse (political, in his case) possible. Bryan treats collapse as something that happened *to* civilizations; Dreher treats it as something civilizations *do to themselves* through psychological susceptibility.

### Topic 2: American Foreign Policy and Neo-Colonialism

**Coverage:**
- [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5): "Donald Vladimirovich Trump's 'Limited Military Operation' in Venezuela"

**Slavoj Zizek ([Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5))** opens with his characteristic provocation: "Welcome to the desert of the real!" His piece analyzes Trump's capture of Maduro and occupation of Venezuela as a return to colonial resource extraction.

Zizek notes the explicit economic motivation: "The US is going to be 'very strongly involved' in Venezuela's oil industry: 'We have the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, the greatest, and we're going to be very much involved in it.'"

He draws a sharp historical parallel:

> "Trump wants Venezuela to return to the US the nationalized property of US oil companies, but Venezuela did the bulk of nationalizations back in 1976, well before the Chavez era, i.e., at a time when it was still considered a 'normal' Western democratic country. What Venezuela did was at that time considered part of a process of nations taking over their own natural resources. Trump's attack is thus directed not just against the 'extreme Left' but against a global process of economic decolonization."

Zizek invokes a devastating historical comparison - Haiti's post-independence "compensation" to France:

> "Haiti had to agree to pay for this the sum of 150 million francs as 'compensation' for the loss of its slaves. This sum, roughly equal to the French annual budget at the time, was later cut to 90 million, but it continued to be a heavy burden that prevented any economic growth: at the end of the 19th century, Haiti's payments to France consumed around 80% of the national budget, and the last installment was paid in 1947."

On the geopolitical implications, [Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) quotes *The Guardian*: "It accelerates the slide from a mostly rules-based world to one of competing spheres of influence, to be determined by armed might and the readiness to use it. David Rothkopf called it the 'Putinization of US foreign policy.'"

His conclusion refuses the binary: "The answer to the question 'Which is worse, Trump or Maduro?' is: both are worse."

### Topic 3: The Role of Community and Belonging

**Coverage:**
- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/a-millennial-benedict-option-in-denmark): "A Millennial Benedict Option In Denmark"
- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag): "Kirk Killing" (concept of Volksgemeinschaft)

**Rod Dreher ([Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/a-millennial-benedict-option-in-denmark))** celebrates a Danish Christian community in his January 12 newsletter, highlighting a 40-minute documentary called *The Remnant: The Last Christians Of Denmark*:

> "a small rural community of Danish Lutherans and Catholics, Millennials who got fed up with the apathy and lifelessness of post-Christian society, and who moved to the country to live with their kids in Christian community."

Dreher quotes community member **Mikkel Sotbaek**, who writes: "I have no money, but I am a rich man." Mikkel explains:

> "We bought our farm ten years ago, dreaming of a more natural and traditional life, prioritizing nature, tradition, and family. Now my wife and I are 30 years old, and we have five children."

Crucially, Mikkel articulates a philosophy of community that acknowledges its limits:

> "True community cannot fully exist in the absence of shared blood, tongue, customs, culture, and cult -- if I may loosely paraphrase Herodotus -- but we love each other, have much in common, and are mindful and respectful of our disagreements."

In his January 15 piece ([Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag)), **Dreher** examines the dark side of this longing for belonging. Citing Rees on Nazi psychology:

> "Their hope was that Hitler would deliver a Volksgemeinschaft -- a 'people's community'. Peter Merkl in his seminal analysis of Theodore Abel's study of several hundred Nazi supporters who became involved with the party before 1933 concluded that the most common ideological theme binding them together was not anti-Semitism but their belief in the Volksgemeinschaft."

**Contrast:** Dreher presents two visions of community: the Danish Christians who explicitly acknowledge their community's limits and "are mindful and respectful of our disagreements," versus the Nazi Volksgemeinschaft which weaponized belonging into exclusion. One is built on humility and voluntary association; the other on pseudo-biological sorting.

### Topic 4: Leadership, Character, and Power

**Coverage:**
- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor): "The Man Who Could Have Been Emperor" (Mark Antony)
- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag): Discussion of Trump, Hitler, and charismatic leadership
- [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5): Analysis of Trump's Venezuela operation

**Anya Leonard ([Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor))** opens the Mark Antony piece with philosophical questions about leadership:

> "What sort of leaders do we admire? Are we drawn to discipline or charisma? To patience or passion? Do we forgive flaws if they come wrapped in brilliance? And what happens when emotion begins to outweigh judgment in public life?"

She challenges the popular image of Antony: "the Antony you think you know, the drunken lover ruined by Cleopatra, is mostly a creation of propaganda and poetry." The real Antony "nearly outplayed Octavian, who used spectacle better than any Roman alive, and who may have understood the future of power more clearly than his famous rival."

Antony's leadership style was personal and soldierly: "He joked with soldiers, ate their food, shared their hardships, and spoke to them as equals rather than tools. He remembered names, praised bravery loudly, and rewarded loyalty generously."

**Rod Dreher ([Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag))** examines leadership through the lens of Nazi psychology, distinguishing between Trump and Hitler:

> "Rees doesn't mention Trump, but he explains inadvertently why 'Trump is Hitler' is so silly. He says that one doesn't get to be a dictator by focusing on one's own greatness. One gets to be a dictator by convincing the masses that the dictator is the living symbol of the nation."

Dreher quotes the insight that "Leadership is always all about 'us'" rather than the "great I." He argues Trump "cannot become a Hitler, in my view, even if he wanted to, because he is so divisive, and doesn't have the skills to unite most of the nation behind him."

Yet Dreher sees a different danger: "These people are paving the way for an American Caesar."

**Slavoj Zizek ([Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5))** offers a more cynical view of power, noting Trump's explicit statements about running Venezuela "indefinitely" and being "in charge." For Zizek, the issue is not Trump's character but the structural logic of imperialism.

### Topic 5: The Radicalization of Young People

**Coverage:**
- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag): "Kirk Killing: The Radical Right's Reichstag Fire"

This is the week's most extensive single piece. Dreher calls Simon van Zuylen-Wood's *New York* magazine article "really important journalism" that made him think "for the first time, that the assassination of Charlie Kirk was the Radical Right's Reichstag fire."

Dreher quotes extensively from the article's interviews with young right-wing activists. At Clemson, student activists questioned JD Vance's credentials:

> "'It's weird to me that he is essentially flirting with the concept of blood-and-soil nationalism while also having a wife who's from halfway across the world,' Lyle said... 'why would you name your kid Vivek, rather than, like, John?'"

On the question of American identity: "'It is essentially the question that will determine what it means to be an American: Is it just holding a piece of paper? Is it just being here under the correct legal status?' Lyle asked. 'The answer we often find is that there is something further. You know, there is certainly a religious element. Obviously, an ethnic element.'"

[Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) connects this to Nazi psychology through Professor Robert Sapolsky:

> "'Them and Us' is 'hard-wired into us via the amygdala and we'll never get rid of it'... 'it is incredibly easy to manipulate people as to who counts as a Them and who counts as an Us.'"

On youth susceptibility, Dreher quotes Rees:

> "The key reason is because the frontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for regulating emotional impulses and analysing problems, is not fully formed until around twenty-five years old."

Dreher's conclusion is stark: "We are not going to be able to reason people who have given themselves over to Fuentes-Candace-Tuckerism out of it."

### Topic 6: Homer and the Persistence of Myth

**Coverage:**
- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons): "When the World Collapsed"
- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-sea-of-homer-live-conversation): "The Sea of Homer"
- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle): "Just a Bloody Spectacle?"

**Van Bryan ([Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons))** explicitly connects the Mycenaean collapse to Homeric myth:

> "The Bronze Age of ancient Greece, which lasted from about 3000 to 1200 BCE, is the historical backdrop for much of Greek mythology as well as the Homeric epics The Iliad and The Odyssey."

He notes that the myths outlasted the civilization that produced them: "from those ashes would rise the myths that still shape us today: Achilles, Odysseus, Troy."

**Anya Leonard ([Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-sea-of-homer-live-conversation))** promotes a live conversation with Emily Wilson, translator of the Odyssey and Iliad:

> "Why do we still read Homer after nearly three thousand years? Homer's stories are filled with monsters, gods, and heroes...but beneath the myth is a deep exploration of human life."

**Lydia Serrant ([Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle))** in "Just a Bloody Spectacle?" traces Homer's influence into Roman theater:

> "When the Latin translation of Homer's Odyssey first hit the Roman theater scene, it was quickly followed by Achilles, Ajax, the Trojan Horse, and later popular comedies such as Virgo and Gladiolus."

She notes that "The Romans liked the adaptations so much that they used Lucius' translations of Homer's Odyssey as an educational book for over 200 years."

### Topic 7: Roman Theater and Stoic Philosophy

**Coverage:**
- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle): "Just a Bloody Spectacle?" by Lydia Serrant

This piece examines the differences between Greek and Roman theatrical traditions. Serrant notes a fundamental distinction in how violence was portrayed:

> "In Greek drama, violent acts happen off-stage (or 'ob scene' in ancient Greek, hence the modern word 'obscene'). When it comes to the Romans, though, the spectacle was one of the main draws."

The infrastructure reflected these differences: "Greek theaters were traditionally carved out of hillsides, whereas Roman theaters were built brick by brick from the ground up." Greeks used natural backdrops; Romans incorporated "backdrops and stage props to propel audiences back to ancient Greece."

[Serrant](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle) focuses particularly on Seneca's contribution:

> "The Romans got from Seneca's plays what they could not get anywhere else: the opportunity to be both entertained and to learn from the philosophical master."

She notes that Seneca's plays "differ from the original Attica (Greek Athenian) plays in that they follow a five-act form instead of the traditional three, and they incorporated rhetoric structures that argued for a particular point of view or philosophical stance."

Seneca's approach was deeply psychological: "Seneca entrenched his plays in turmoil and personal conflict, and he focused on social and political issues that were relevant at the time and remain relevant to modern audiences."

On the lasting influence: "Like Shakespeare, Seneca did not write for a specific place or time. Yet through dialogues and soliloquies, his plays have be re-enacted again and again throughout history, which is a testament to their popularity and longevity."

### Topic 8: The Psychology of Conspiracy Theories and Scapegoating

**Coverage:**
- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag): "Kirk Killing"
- [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5): Historical parallels to scapegoating

[Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) devotes significant attention to why conspiracy theories appeal, drawing from Rees and psychologist Karen Douglas:

> "The latest psychological research demonstrates that this attempt at scapegoating fits into a typical pattern. The social psychologist Professor Karen Douglas believes that as most conspiracy theorists are 'looking for someone to blame', the idea that 'there are these people pulling the strings behind the scenes' helps deal with their 'feelings of powerlessness and disillusionment'."

He also quotes Douglas on how conspiracy belief spreads: "'If someone believes one conspiracy theory, they are more likely to believe in or look for others. People can go down the rabbit hole and you can get a bit lost.'"

Dreher applies this to his observation about anti-Semitic memes: "that Texas college student told me last fall in Budapest: that he has friends who get hit daily with a barrage of funny, transgressive anti-Semitic memes, and one day boom, they wake up and hate Jews. Something snaps."

[Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) draws historical parallels to scapegoating through his comparison of Trump's Venezuela rhetoric to the Opium Wars:

> "Remember the horror of the two Opium Wars fought (not only) by the British Empire against China... The result was catastrophic: soon after, China's economy shrank by half. But what should interest us is the legitimization of this brutal military intervention: free trade is the basis of civilization, and Chinese prohibition of opium imports is thus a barbarian threat to civilization."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### Theme: The Fragility of Civilization

Both [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) and [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) grapple with how quickly established orders can collapse. Van Bryan shows civilizations that "rose to prominence in 1600 BCE" lasting "only 400 years" before disappearing so completely that their successors thought them mythical. Dreher shows how the Nazi Party went from "2.7 percent of the vote" in 1928 to ruling Germany within five years. Both suggest that collapse can be shockingly swift and that we may not recognize the warning signs.

### Theme: The Power of Narrative and Propaganda

The Mycenaeans are remembered through Homer; the Nazis built their movement on myth-making and propaganda. Seneca used the structure of Greek myths to convey Stoic philosophy. [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) asks readers to consider "what lessons you think we should take away from both their crowning achievements as well as their catastrophic collapse." [Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) notes how the popular narrative of Mark Antony and Maduro alike are "mostly a creation of propaganda" - history written by victors.

### Theme: Rules-Based Order vs. Spheres of Influence

[Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) explicitly frames the Venezuela operation as marking a transition "from a mostly rules-based world to one of competing spheres of influence." This resonates with [Classical Wisdom's](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor) exploration of how Rome transitioned from Republic to Empire - moments when norms give way to raw power.

### Theme: Youth and Idealism

[Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) emphasizes that young people are particularly susceptible to extremism because their frontal cortex is not fully developed. [Classical Wisdom's](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) material on the Mycenaeans shows young warriors fighting in conflicts that would become legend. Antony's wild youth eventually gave way to political ambition. Youth appears as both the agents and the subjects of history's great changes.

## Surprising or Notable Insights

1. **The Mycenaean invaders, not the invaded**: Van Bryan ([Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons)) notes the surprising discovery by linguist Michael Ventris in the 1950s that "it was not the Minoans that invaded the Mycenaeans... It was mainland Greece that invaded the island nation of Crete." The tablets at Pylos, written in Minoan script, were actually written in Greek.

2. **Haiti paid "compensation" for its slaves until 1947**: [Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) reveals that Haiti's payments to France "consumed around 80% of the national budget" at the end of the 19th century, and "the last installment was paid in 1947" - a stunning detail about the economics of colonialism.

3. **Mark Antony as nearly winning**: Anya Leonard ([Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor)) argues Antony "nearly outplayed Octavian" and "may have understood the future of power more clearly than his famous rival" - a significant challenge to the standard narrative of Antony as a doomed romantic.

4. **Anti-Semitism was not the primary Nazi draw**: [Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) cites Rees's finding that "the most common ideological theme binding them together was not anti-Semitism but their belief in the Volksgemeinschaft" - the longing for community came first.

5. **The etymology of "obscene"**: Lydia Serrant ([Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle)) reveals that the word "obscene" derives from the Greek theatrical convention of placing violent acts "off-stage" (ob scene).

6. **Homer as Roman textbook**: The Odyssey in Latin translation "was used as an educational book for over 200 years" by the Romans ([Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle)), showing the depth of classical education's reliance on Homeric texts.

7. **Trump cannot be Hitler (according to Dreher)**: [Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) argues Trump "cannot become a Hitler" because "one doesn't get to be a dictator by focusing on one's own greatness" but by becoming the symbol of the nation. Trump is too personally divisive.

8. **Candace Owens on time travel**: [Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) mentions that "Candace Owens is now theorizing that Charlie Kirk may have been some sort of time traveler" - an example of how conspiracy thinking spreads even among influential figures.

9. **The conflict is a "false struggle"**: [Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) argues that "The conflict between Trump's US and Maduro's Venezuela is simply a false struggle, a struggle that obfuscates any authentic leftist prospect" - refusing to take either side.

- **Unique Angle**: Refuses the binary of supporting either side; draws historical parallels to 19th-century colonial extraction (Haiti's "compensation" payments, Opium Wars)

## Patterns and Trends

This week's philosophy newsletters reveal a deep anxiety about civilizational fragility that manifests in multiple directions:

1. **Looking backward**: [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) mines ancient history for lessons, finding in the Bronze Age Collapse a mirror for modern interconnected vulnerability. The message is implicitly consoling: collapse has happened before, myths survived, civilization returned. The focus on Roman theater and Seneca similarly suggests that wisdom transmits across cultures and centuries.

2. **Looking forward with alarm**: [Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) sees in contemporary America the preconditions for political extremism, explicitly drawing parallels to Weimar Germany. His message is more urgent: we must understand these patterns now, because we may be living through them.

3. **Rejecting the binary**: [Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) refuses to choose between Trump and Maduro, arguing both represent failures. His focus on the structural logic of imperialism offers a third perspective beyond progressive vs. conservative framing.

Both [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) and [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/a-millennial-benedict-option-in-denmark) serve educated, historically-minded readers who want context for current anxieties. But where [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) maintains scholarly distance (the Bronze Age Collapse is interesting *and* relevant), [Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) writes as an engaged participant, warning that "these people are paving the way for an American Caesar." [Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) operates from a Marxist framework that sees both American liberal democracy and right-wing populism as inadequate.

The newsletters also share an interest in what holds societies together: shared myths (Homer), shared faith (Christianity), shared belonging (Volksgemeinschaft, Danish intentional community). The question animating all three is whether these binding forces can be constructive or whether they inevitably become exclusionary.

A surprising resonance emerges between Seneca's philosophical dramas and [Dreher's](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) political psychology: both explore how narrative and spectacle shape human behavior, and both grapple with the relationship between entertainment and moral instruction. The Romans wanted spectacle with wisdom; Dreher worries about a generation raised on spectacle without wisdom.
