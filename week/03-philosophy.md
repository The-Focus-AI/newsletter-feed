# Week 03 Philosophy Newsletter Analysis (January 12-17, 2026)

## Overview

This week's philosophy newsletters span an extraordinary range: from Bronze Age civilizational collapse to contemporary political upheaval, from intentional Christian communities in Denmark to the psychology of radicalization, and from Stoic tragedy to the enduring relevance of Homer. [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) dominates with four pieces exploring ancient history's lessons for modernity, while [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) offers urgent commentary on right-wing radicalization through the lens of Weimar psychology, and [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) delivers characteristically provocative analyses of U.S. intervention in Venezuela and the culture wars over gender and education.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Civilizational Collapse and Historical Lessons

**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons)

The week opened with a meditation on the Bronze Age Collapse of 1177 BC, drawing explicit parallels to contemporary anxieties about systemic fragility. The piece examines how the Mycenaean civilization, which had dominated the Aegean for 400 years, vanished within a century, plunging Greece into a dark age.

> "Imagine one day waking up to a world gone...dark. Suddenly there was no internet. No wifi or signal, no electricity, and no gas. Credit cards didn't work and banks were permanently closed." --- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons)

The article notes that "earthquakes, invasions, internal revolts, famine, climate change, and the mysterious 'Sea Peoples' may all have played a role. But no single explanation tells the whole story." This multi-causal framing invites readers to consider how complex systems fail not through single catastrophic events but through cascading, interconnected pressures.

### 2. Leadership, Character, and Power

**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor)

On Mark Antony's traditional birthday (January 14), Classical Wisdom published a reassessment of the man who nearly became Rome's first emperor. The piece challenges the dominant narrative of Antony as "the drunken lover ruined by Cleopatra," arguing this is "mostly a creation of propaganda and poetry."

> "What kind of man was Antony really...and how close did he come to becoming Rome's first true emperor?" --- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor)

The analysis frames Antony as someone who "nearly mastered the new world that Caesar had created" but failed due to "a fatal mismatch between his nature and the age he lived in." This poses enduring questions about whether leadership requires adapting to one's era or holding to principle regardless of context.

### 3. U.S. Intervention in Venezuela and Neo-Colonial Critique

**Coverage:** [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5)

Zizek delivers his most politically charged piece of the week, analyzing the U.S. capture of Maduro through a Marxist anti-colonial lens. The title itself---"Donald Vladimirovich Trump"---signals Zizek's thesis that American foreign policy has become indistinguishable from Russian authoritarianism.

> "Trump said on January 3, 2026, that the US is 'going to run' Venezuela indefinitely: 'We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,' and, even more directly, that he considers himself 'in charge of Venezuela.'" --- [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5)

Zizek draws a striking historical parallel to Haiti's post-independence debt to France, where freed slaves were forced to pay compensation to their former masters. He argues the Venezuelan intervention represents "the darkest criminal past of Western colonialism" returning "under the guise of supporting democracy."

Most provocatively, Zizek refuses to let anti-Trump sentiment become pro-Maduro sympathy:

> "The answer to the question 'Which is worse, Trump or Maduro?' is: both are worse." --- [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5)

### 4. Intentional Christian Community and the Benedict Option

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/a-millennial-benedict-option-in-denmark)

Dreher highlights a documentary about young Danish Christians who have established an intentional rural community in one of the world's most secular countries. The piece presents this as a living example of his "Benedict Option" thesis.

> "I have no money, but I am a rich man." --- Mikkel Sotbaek, quoted in [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/a-millennial-benedict-option-in-denmark)

The community is notable for its ecumenical character---Lutheran and Catholic families living together---and its explicit rejection of "the apathy and lifelessness of post-Christian society." Dreher frames this as millennials taking seriously what older generations merely lamented.

### 5. The Psychology of Political Radicalization

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag)

Dreher's longest and most analytical piece of the week draws on Laurence Rees's *The Nazi Mind* to understand the radicalization of young American conservatives following Charlie Kirk's assassination. He explicitly calls the killing "the Radical Right's Reichstag fire."

> "We are all creatures of a particular time and a particular place. That might seem self-evident, but my experience is that many people don't fully appreciate the extent to which they are shaped by time and place." --- Laurence Rees, quoted in [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag)

The piece synthesizes neuroscience and history to explain why young people are especially susceptible to extremism:

> "The key reason is because the frontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for regulating emotional impulses and analysing problems, is not fully formed until around twenty-five years old." --- [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag)

Dreher's conclusion is stark: "These people are paving the way for an American Caesar."

### 6. Homer's Enduring Relevance

**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-sea-of-homer-live-conversation)

A brief announcement piece for a conversation with translator Emily Wilson nonetheless poses the central question:

> "Why do we still read Homer after nearly three thousand years?" --- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-sea-of-homer-live-conversation)

The answer offered: "beneath the myth is a deep exploration of human life...about violence and forgiveness, leadership and failure, loyalty and longing."

### 7. Roman Theater and Stoic Philosophy

**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle)

The week included an examination of Roman theater's debt to and divergence from Greek tragedy, with particular attention to Seneca's plays. The piece notes that Romans preferred spectacle over the Greeks' philosophical restraint.

> "In Greek drama, violent acts happen off-stage (or 'ob scene' in ancient Greek, hence the modern word 'obscene'). When it comes to the Romans, though, the spectacle was one of the main draws." --- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle)

Seneca emerges as a bridge figure who gave Roman audiences "the opportunity to be both entertained and to learn from the philosophical master." His plays "were written to affect the human psyche, and explore the moral and philosophical territory."

### 8. Gender, Sex, and the Culture Wars in Education

**Coverage:** [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/neither-biological-sex-nor-cultural)

Zizek responded to Texas A&M University's prohibition of teaching Plato's *Symposium* (deemed too close to "gender ideology") with characteristic dialectical reversal. He argued that both the conservative insistence on binary biological sex and the progressive celebration of gender fluidity share a common flaw: both ignore "the constitutively traumatic nature of sexuality brought out by psychoanalytic theory."

> "The neoconservative patriarchal claim that there are two sexes grounded in biology, dismissing all other combinations as pathological, and the trans celebration of the multiple choices of our gender identity share a key feature --- they both ignore the constitutively traumatic nature of sexuality." --- [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/neither-biological-sex-nor-cultural)

Zizek confessed that when he first heard the news without knowing details, he was unsure whether it was a rightist or leftist act---and claimed there was "a moment of truth in my stupidity." He argues that both sides of the gender debate reject psychoanalysis because it reveals uncomfortable truths neither wants to face.

### 9. Dystopia, Freedom, and the Right to Suffer

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/noble-lesbian-savage-fights-for-humanity)

Dreher closed the week praising the Apple TV series *Pluribus*, comparing it to Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World* in its exploration of totalitarianism through comfort rather than coercion. The show's protagonist, a "grumpy, middle-aged lesbian novelist," and her Catholic ally embody resistance to a utopia that eliminates suffering---and with it, freedom.

> "There's many kinds of Catholics, but I grew up with the kind of Catholic that accepts that life is hardship and suffering and strife, and in a way, that makes it worth living." --- Carlos-Manuel Vesga, quoted in [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/noble-lesbian-savage-fights-for-humanity)

The piece argues that we live in "an era and a culture in which people are willing to surrender the liberty and their humanity to be relieved from discomfort and anxiety." The show's unlikely alliance between a lesbian novelist and a traditional Catholic represents resistance to totalitarian comfort.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Fragility of Civilization

Both [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) and [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) grapple with how stable-seeming societies can collapse rapidly. Classical Wisdom examines this through the Bronze Age Collapse; Dreher through Weimar Germany's descent into Nazism. Both resist monocausal explanations, emphasizing cascading failures and the impossibility of direct historical parallels while insisting on the value of historical thinking.

### Leadership and Character in Crisis

[Classical Wisdom's](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor) piece on Mark Antony and [Rod Dreher's](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) analysis of contemporary political leadership both ask what kinds of leaders emerge in periods of upheaval. Antony's "fatal mismatch between his nature and the age" echoes Dreher's observation that Trump "cannot become a Hitler...because he is so divisive, and doesn't have the skills to unite most of the nation behind him."

### The Role of Religion in Social Cohesion

[Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/a-millennial-benedict-option-in-denmark) presents intentional Christian community as a response to post-Christian anomie, while his [later piece](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) argues that "active, serious Christianity is the only barrier that will keep this from happening to the Right." His [review of Pluribus](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/noble-lesbian-savage-fights-for-humanity) presents a Catholic character whose faith enables resistance to comfortable tyranny. [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5), by contrast, offers no religious solution to political crisis, instead diagnosing structural contradictions that no individual moral commitment can resolve.

### Classical Wisdom as Contemporary Commentary

All [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) pieces this week frame ancient history as directly relevant to present anxieties---whether about civilizational collapse, leadership in crisis, or the enduring human questions in Homer. The newsletter consistently positions classics not as antiquarian interest but as urgent wisdom.

### The Psychology of Extremism

[Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) and [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) both analyze political extremism, but from radically different frameworks. Dreher draws on neuroscience and social psychology to explain individual radicalization; Zizek deploys Marxist political economy to explain state behavior. Both reject easy partisan framings---Dreher critiques the Right he belongs to, Zizek refuses to defend Maduro despite opposing U.S. intervention.

### Suffering as Essential to Freedom

[Rod Dreher's](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/noble-lesbian-savage-fights-for-humanity) discussion of *Pluribus* and Huxley's *Brave New World* connects to [Classical Wisdom's](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle) examination of Roman tragedy. Both explore how cultures process violence and suffering through narrative. The Romans wanted to see violence onstage; Huxley's dystopia (and its TV descendant) eliminates suffering entirely. Both extremes may represent failures to integrate hardship into meaningful life.

## Surprising or Contrarian Perspectives

- [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) argues that the U.S. treating Venezuela's oil as "stolen" American property echoes the logic that forced Haiti to pay France for the "loss" of its slaves---a striking historical parallel that reframes resource nationalism as a form of colonial resistance rather than theft.

- [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) explicitly rejects the "Trump is Hitler" comparison while using Nazi history to understand contemporary right-wing radicalization, a nuanced position that neither dismisses historical parallels nor deploys them lazily.

- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor) challenges received wisdom about Mark Antony, suggesting his failure was not moral weakness but a "mismatch" between personality and historical moment---implying that virtue alone does not determine historical success.

- [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/neither-biological-sex-nor-cultural) confesses he initially could not tell if the Texas A&M Plato ban was a rightist or leftist act---and insists this confusion contained philosophical truth about how both sides of the gender debate avoid the traumatic core of sexuality.

- [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/noble-lesbian-savage-fights-for-humanity) praises a show whose unlikely hero is a "grumpy, middle-aged lesbian novelist" allied with a traditional Catholic---an intentionally dissonant pairing that models resistance to ideological purity tests.
