## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. The Psychology of Political Radicalization and "Weimar America"

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag), [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/weimar-america-and-a-smoldering-world)

Rod Dreher devoted two substantial essays to what he terms "Weimar America" -- drawing explicit parallels between contemporary American political dynamics and 1920s Germany. His analysis centers on the assassination of Charlie Kirk and its aftermath, which he calls "the Radical Right's Reichstag fire."

Drawing heavily on Laurence Rees's *The Nazi Mind*, Dreher argues that the conditions for political extremism need not mirror Germany's exact traumas to produce similar psychological effects:

> "We are all creatures of a particular time and place... If we ever get fascism or communism in America, it won't come the way it came to Germany and Russia. It will come in an American way, through means particular to our own era." -- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag)

He highlights concerning trends among Gen Z conservatives, citing detailed reporting from *New York* magazine about the rise of Nick Fuentes-style ethnonationalism within organizations like TPUSA. Particularly alarming to Dreher is the normalization of anti-Semitism through "funny, transgressive" memes:

> "That Texas college student told me last fall in Budapest: that he has friends who get hit daily with a barrage of funny, transgressive anti-Semitic memes, and one day boom, they wake up and hate Jews. Something snaps." -- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag)

By week's end, in his [January 18 newsletter](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/weimar-america-and-a-smoldering-world), Dreher pointed to Nick Fuentes and associates performing Nazi salutes in Miami as confirmation of his concerns, writing:

> "There is not enough irony in the world to legitimize what these scumbags in Miami did. What Fuentes and his growing group of followers among the influencers are doing is conditioning people to see Jews as subhuman." -- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/weimar-america-and-a-smoldering-world)

Drawing on his reading of *The Nazi Mind*, Dreher emphasized how ordinary, educated people can be conditioned to commit atrocities:

> "Two of the four commanders of the Einsatzgruppen, Arthur Nebe, head of the Criminal Police, and Walter Stahlecker, who had led security forces in Norway, volunteered for the job. The others were appointed... In Einsatzgruppe A, eleven of the seventeen most senior leaders were lawyers; nine held academic doctorates." -- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/weimar-america-and-a-smoldering-world)

### 2. Civilizational Collapse and Historical Lessons

**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons), [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor)

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) opened the week with a haunting meditation on the Bronze Age Collapse of 1177 BC, drawing uncomfortable parallels to contemporary fragility:

> "Imagine one day waking up to a world gone...dark. Suddenly there was no internet. No wifi or signal, no electricity, and no gas. Credit cards didn't work and banks were permanently closed." -- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons)

The newsletter examined the Mycenaean civilization, which rose suddenly to prominence around 1600 BCE only to vanish within 400 years. Author Van Bryan notes that "we may never know what truly killed the Mycenaean civilization so abruptly and with such finality," but suggests multiple cascading factors -- earthquakes, invasions, revolts, famine, climate change, and the mysterious "Sea Peoples" -- may have combined catastrophically.

Later in the week, [Classical Wisdom explored Mark Antony's birthday](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor), examining the question of leadership qualities and what makes leaders rise or fall:

> "What sort of leaders do we admire? Are we drawn to discipline or charisma? To patience or passion? Do we forgive flaws if they come wrapped in brilliance?" -- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor)

### 3. US Foreign Policy, Neo-Colonialism, and Venezuela

**Coverage:** [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5)

Slavoj Zizek delivered a searing critique of the Trump administration's intervention in Venezuela, provocatively titled "Donald Vladimirovich Trump's 'Limited Military Operation' in Venezuela" -- deliberately echoing Putin's language about Ukraine.

Zizek argues the intervention represents a return to colonial-era resource extraction under democratic pretenses:

> "Trump wants Venezuela to return to the US the nationalized property of US oil companies, but Venezuela did the bulk of nationalizations back in 1976, well before the Chavez era, i.e., at a time when it was still considered a 'normal' Western democratic country." -- [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5)

He draws a historical parallel to Haiti's independence, when the newly-freed nation was forced to pay France for the "loss" of its slaves -- a debt that crippled Haiti for over a century.

Yet Zizek refuses to take Maduro's side, noting the failure of the Bolivarian revolution:

> "The first task of the Left today is not to castigate Trump for his crime (which was totally expected) but to analyze the reasons why the 'Bolivarian revolution' went so terribly wrong." -- [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5)

His conclusion captures his characteristic dialectical approach: "The answer to the question 'Which is worse, Trump or Maduro?' is: both are worse."

### 4. The Benedict Option and Intentional Christian Community

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/a-millennial-benedict-option-in-denmark)

Dreher began the week on a hopeful note, highlighting a documentary about young Danish Christians forming intentional community in rural Denmark. The piece features Mikkel Sotbaek, who describes their community:

> "We bought our farm ten years ago, dreaming of a more natural and traditional life, prioritizing nature, tradition, and family. Now my wife and I are 30 years old, and we have five children." -- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/a-millennial-benedict-option-in-denmark)

Notably, this ecumenical community includes both Lutheran and Catholic families, suggesting the "Benedict Option" need not be confined to a single denomination. Mikkel captures the community's ethos: "I have no money, but I am a rich man."

### 5. Sex, Gender, and Ideological Censorship

**Coverage:** [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/neither-biological-sex-nor-cultural)

Zizek addressed the bizarre situation at Texas A&M University, where Plato's *Symposium* was banned from a philosophy course under anti-gender-ideology rules. The absurdity of prohibiting Western philosophy's founder struck Zizek, but led him to a deeper point:

> "The neoconservative patriarchal claim that there are two sexes grounded in biology, dismissing all other combinations as pathological, and the trans celebration of the multiple choices of our gender identity share a key feature -- they both ignore the constitutively traumatic nature of sexuality brought out by psychoanalytic theory and practice." -- [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/neither-biological-sex-nor-cultural)

He confesses: "When I first heard the news about this prohibition without knowing the details, I wasn't sure if it was a Trumpian rightist act (which it turned out to be) or a politically correct leftist act against patriarchal binary sexuality."

### 6. Art, Suffering, and the Human Condition

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/noble-lesbian-savage-fights-for-humanity), [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle)

Dreher wrote enthusiastically about the Apple TV series *Pluribus*, which updates Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World* for contemporary audiences. He sees it as a meditation on the value of suffering for human freedom:

> "When people talk about totalitarianism, they think of gulags, George Orwell, secret police knocking on the door at night, and coercion... But that's not the only way to think about totalitarianism." -- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/noble-lesbian-savage-fights-for-humanity)

The show's unlikely alliance between a lesbian novelist and a traditional Catholic represents resistance to comfortable tyranny. Actor Carlos-Manuel Vesga explains his character's Catholic worldview:

> "There's many kinds of Catholics, but I grew up with the kind of Catholic that accepts that life is hardship and suffering and strife, and in a way, that makes it worth living." -- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/noble-lesbian-savage-fights-for-humanity)

Meanwhile, [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle) explored the world of Roman theater, particularly Seneca's plays. The piece notes that while Greeks kept violence off-stage (giving us the word "obscene" from "ob scene" -- off the scene), Romans made spectacle of bloodshed. Yet Seneca's work transcended mere entertainment:

> "Seneca's plays were written to affect the human psyche, and explore the moral and philosophical territory. Like Shakespeare, Seneca did not write for a specific place or time." -- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/just-a-bloody-spectacle)

### 7. Homer's Enduring Relevance

**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-sea-of-homer-live-conversation)

Classical Wisdom announced an upcoming live conversation with translator Emily Wilson, asking the perennial question:

> "Why do we still read Homer after nearly three thousand years? Homer's stories are filled with monsters, gods, and heroes...but beneath the myth is a deep exploration of human life." -- [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-sea-of-homer-live-conversation)

### 8. Trump's Greenland Gambit and International Order

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/weimar-america-and-a-smoldering-world)

In his final newsletter of the week, Dreher addressed Trump's aggressive stance toward European allies over Greenland, warning of catastrophic consequences:

> "Europe will immediately demand the closure of every U.S. military base on the continent. Ramstein in Germany, Aviano in Italy, Lakenheath in the UK. The US's ability to project power into the Middle East and Africa vanishes overnight." -- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/weimar-america-and-a-smoldering-world)

He cites James Lindsay's critique that Trump's team is misreading the American mood:

> "The sober majority doesn't want the kind of 'thumb in the eye,' 'own the libs' style that made Trump45 fun anymore. We want an assurance through Trump47 that things can and will 'go back to normal.'" -- [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/weimar-america-and-a-smoldering-world)

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Civilizational Anxiety Across the Political Spectrum**

Both [Rod Dreher's Diary](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/weimar-america-and-a-smoldering-world) and [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/when-the-world-collapsed-lessons) grappled with the possibility of civilizational collapse. While Classical Wisdom looked back 3,000 years to the Mycenaeans, Dreher looked back merely 100 to Weimar Germany. Both suggest that complex, interconnected societies can collapse faster than their inhabitants expect, and that the causes are often multiple and cascading rather than singular.

**The Convergence of Opposites**

[Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/neither-biological-sex-nor-cultural) repeatedly found unlikely common ground between supposed opposites -- Trump and Maduro as both "worse," conservative biological essentialism and trans ideology as both avoiding the deeper truth about sexuality. This dialectical approach stands in contrast to the polarization Dreher documents on the American Right.

**The Search for Community and Meaning**

Across all three newsletters, there's a shared recognition that atomized modern life fails to provide meaning. [Dreher's Danish Christians](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/a-millennial-benedict-option-in-denmark) seek it in intentional community; [Classical Wisdom's](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-man-who-could-have-been-emperor) exploration of Mark Antony asks what truly makes a meaningful life; [Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/neither-biological-sex-nor-cultural) suggests both trans identity politics and traditionalist reactions are responses to the same underlying alienation.

**Faith as Bulwark or Battleground**

Religion appears throughout as either solution or problem. [Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) argues that "active, serious Christianity is the only barrier" to right-wing extremism. His [review of Pluribus](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/noble-lesbian-savage-fights-for-humanity) presents a Catholic character whose faith enables resistance to comfortable tyranny. Yet the Texas A&M controversy in [Zizek's piece](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/neither-biological-sex-nor-cultural) shows religious and secular ideologies colliding in unexpected ways, with Plato becoming collateral damage.

**The Psychology of Extremism**

[Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kirk-killing-the-radical-rights-reichstag) and [Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/donald-vladimirovich-trumps-limited-ad5) both analyze political extremism, but from radically different frameworks. Dreher draws on neuroscience and social psychology to explain individual radicalization; Zizek deploys Marxist political economy to explain state behavior. Both reject easy partisan framings -- Dreher critiques the Right he belongs to, Zizek refuses to defend Maduro despite opposing U.S. intervention.
