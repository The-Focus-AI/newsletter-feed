# Week 05 Culture Newsletter Analysis (January 20-26, 2026)

## Overview

Week 05 of 2026 was dominated by a single story that united nearly every culture newsletter: the ICE occupation of Minneapolis, which escalated from law enforcement operation to what multiple sources characterized as a humanitarian crisis and potential civil war flashpoint. [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/whatever-you-think-it-is-it-s-worse), [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/ca9393dc?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/dental-pain-at-148800310?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148800310&utm_id=aca7bb1b-53cd-4946-b3d1-7bee87ae2940&utm_medium=email), and [Kottke.org](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/dec/23/capitalism-by-sven-beckert-review-an-extraordinary-history-of-the-economic-system-that-controls-our-lives) all devoted significant coverage to community resistance, the murders of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, and the broader implications for American democracy. Alongside this urgent political crisis, newsletters grappled with questions about influencer culture, scientific writing, AI consciousness, and the nature of memory and tourism—both literal and metaphorical.

The ICE occupation of Minneapolis became the defining cultural story of Week 05, with multiple newsletters documenting grassroots resistance, state violence, and the transformation of American civic life. [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/whatever-you-think-it-is-it-s-worse) framed the escalation through the lens of Musicology Duck's viral bus kidnapping thread, noting how "whatever you think it is, it's worse" became the week's unofficial motto. The newsletter emphasized how quickly Minneapolis residents mobilized, with [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/5ff88965?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) publishing an interview with local activists Christina Nicholson and Anika detailing the community's response infrastructure.

> "I don't think those fuckers were ready for all of this and how quickly we mobilized. We know each other. And we know who the fuck is down to ride right down to the house." — Christina Nicholson, [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/5ff88965?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

The murders of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti marked turning points in the crisis. [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/dental-pain-at-148800310?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148800310&utm_id=aca7bb1b-53cd-4946-b3d1-7bee87ae2940&utm_medium=email) shared particularly affecting testimony about Pretti, an ICU nurse at the VA who had just read the final salute to a dying veteran before being killed by federal agents. Multiple newsletters documented the general strike on January 23rd, with organizers predicting strong turnout despite temperatures of 17 below zero.

[Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/ca9393dc?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) published a powerful essay by Kọ́lá Túbọ̀sún, a Nigerian writer attending a literary festival in Sharjah, who drew connections between Minneapolis and his experiences under Nigerian military dictatorships:

> "When Trevor Noah warned in 2016 that Trump reminded Africans of an African dictator, it made all the sense in the world to someone whose formative years were spent on that continent. Now, ten years later, Trump has achieved a status that would make even an Idi Amin blush." — [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/ca9393dc?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

### 2. Influencer Culture and Digital Self-Performance

**Coverage:** [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/is-everyone-now-148724549?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148724549&utm_id=043603bc-243f-44eb-9fec-bff2bc3167f0&utm_medium=email), [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/24c50d56?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/twenty-twenty-frixx)

[Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/is-everyone-now-148724549?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148724549&utm_id=043603bc-243f-44eb-9fec-bff2bc3167f0&utm_medium=email) explored "influencer creep"—how influencer behaviors like self-branding, performance of authenticity, and constant optimization have become normalized across all online interaction. The podcast episode with Sophie Bishop examined how even those who don't consider themselves influencers now craft LinkedIn profiles, choose Instagram fonts, and participate in workplace TikToks using influencer vernacular.

[Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/24c50d56?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) published Rax King's essay "Sex Tourist," which reframed promiscuity as a form of cultural tourism and self-education, contrasting it with the flat, consumptive portrayal of sex in Sex and the City. King argued that her "sex tourism" was about enriching experiences and viewpoints, stealing mementos and knowledge from partners' lives:

> "I made a home out of people whose names I mostly can't remember now, and I made a self out of them, too... My own life is muddied, tamped down all over with footprints. And isn't that what adulthood ought to be?" — [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/24c50d56?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

[Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/twenty-twenty-frixx) coined the term "friction-maxxing" to describe 2026's cultural moment—rejecting smooth digital surfaces for messy, resistant engagement. The newsletter also covered drama in the "Heated Rivalry" fan community, where a podcast host's private texts disparaging the romance novel's creators as "cowards" and "losers" sparked debate about performative allyship.

### 3. Science, Writing, and Public Understanding

**Coverage:** [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/behold-deeply-148719274?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148719274&utm_id=6525a169-8abe-41ea-959e-e8e9b9c496d5&utm_medium=email), [Patrick Tanguay (Sentiers)](https://sentiers.media/r/7a503526?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

[Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/behold-deeply-148719274?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148719274&utm_id=6525a169-8abe-41ea-959e-e8e9b9c496d5&utm_medium=email) published a comprehensive interview with Bethann Garramon Merkle about teaching scientific writing. The conversation traced how 19th-century German university reforms and British efforts to gatekeep natural history created the current broken system where science trainees are expected to write technical papers without ever being taught how. Merkle argued that better science communication could bridge the public trust gap threatening American democracy.

[Patrick Tanguay (Sentiers)](https://sentiers.media/r/7a503526?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b) featured neuroscientist Anil Seth's argument that conscious AI remains unlikely because consciousness requires biological life, not just computation. Seth challenged Silicon Valley's "techno-rapture" mythology while warning that even if AIs aren't conscious, "we still might be unable to resist feeling that it is."

The same newsletter published Joan Westenberg's piece arguing that online discourse functions as a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack on collective thinking:

> "The discourse takes the most important problem of our time and converts it into an infinite series of tribal skirmishes, each of which generates heat and engagement while bringing us no closer to answering any of the actual hard questions." — [Patrick Tanguay (Sentiers)](https://sentiers.media/r/7a503526?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

### 4. Memory, History, and Cultural Identity

**Coverage:** [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/10dcd3ed?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/c7bb70dd?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-january-26/)

[Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/10dcd3ed?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) published Anna Merlan's meditation on the 1939 Federal Writers Project NYC guidebook, which employed out-of-work writers including Ralph Ellison and Zora Neale Hurston. The piece evoked a parallel New York existing alongside our current one—where Sunset Park was a Finnish neighborhood and Rikers Island was celebrated as a "model penitentiary." Merlan noted how the program was eventually killed by the House Un-American Activities Committee for being a "hotbed of Communists."

[The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/c7bb70dd?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) featured Japanese death poems (jisei) and genealogical reflections on a great-great-grandmother named Bertha who fled Minsk in 1866. [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-january-26/) reviewed Jonathan Blitzer's New Yorker profile of Congresswoman LaMonica McIver, who faced felony charges for expressing "righteous anger" during an ICE jail visit.

### 5. Practical Life and Consumer Culture

**Coverage:** [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/9da3c4a6?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [In Pursuit of Tea](mailto:info@inpursuitoftea.com), [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/what-have-you-on-148618464?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148618464&utm_id=db18eab7-2c14-43c3-9eee-539f7f3e3878&utm_medium=email), [Kottke.org](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/dec/23/capitalism-by-sven-beckert-review-an-extraordinary-history-of-the-economic-system-that-controls-our-lives)

[The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/9da3c4a6?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) explored practical topics including the 19th-century invention of surgical rubber gloves (prompted by one nurse's sensitive skin), why period drama directors fill shots with sheep (to show "economic realities" without exposition about enclosure), and the origins of the workplace rhyme "Oompa-Loompa stick it up your jumper."

[In Pursuit of Tea](mailto:info@inpursuitoftea.com) announced two new matcha grades from Marukyu Koyamaen, explaining the difference between koicha (thick tea) and usucha (thin tea) preparations. [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/what-have-you-on-148618464?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148618464&utm_id=db18eab7-2c14-43c3-9eee-539f7f3e3878&utm_medium=email) invited readers to share purchases that "weren't worth it"—a lighthearted prompt that felt like cultural whiplash against the week's heavier coverage.

[Kottke.org](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/dec/23/capitalism-by-sven-beckert-review-an-extraordinary-history-of-the-economic-system-that-controls-our-lives) shared the story of a Chinese factory that accidentally stitched a frown on a Year of the Horse plush toy, creating the viral "Cry-Cry Horse"—"the perfect mascot for 2026."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Personal is (Still) Political

Every newsletter, regardless of primary focus, found ways to connect personal experience to larger political realities. [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/24c50d56?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) published Luke O'Neil's haunting fiction about witnessing stars in Maine while processing Minneapolis, ending with the observation: "You could dream of something better even now if you looked at it all for too long. Maybe that's why they had to dull the sky with toil and industry." [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/dental-pain-at-148800310?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148800310&utm_id=aca7bb1b-53cd-4946-b3d1-7bee87ae2940&utm_medium=email) framed dental pain as metaphor for our collective need for care, while [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/whatever-you-think-it-is-it-s-worse) opened with a bus kidnapping as allegory for national events.

### Expertise Under Siege

Multiple newsletters examined how genuine expertise struggles against viral misinformation. [Patrick Tanguay (Sentiers)](https://sentiers.media/r/7a503526?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b) noted that "the discourse hates expertise" and forces experts to "compress their nuanced understanding into takes that can compete with the confident nonsense being spouted by random accounts with anime avatars." [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/behold-deeply-148719274?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148719274&utm_id=6525a169-8abe-41ea-959e-e8e9b9c496d5&utm_medium=email)'s interview with Bethann Garramon Merkle detailed how scientific training systematically fails to teach communication skills, contributing to public distrust.

### Memory as Resistance

Faced with rapid political transformation, newsletters turned to history and memory as forms of resistance. [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/10dcd3ed?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) archived a Depression-era guidebook, [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/c7bb70dd?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) featured death poems and genealogy, and [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-january-26/) insisted on documenting ICE overreach. The act of careful documentation felt urgent as sources warned about versions of events being "changed" or "erased."

### Community Over Individual

The Minneapolis crisis revealed how community organizing learned from 2020's George Floyd protests now provides rapid response networks, mutual aid, and collective protection. [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/5ff88965?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) detailed how neighbors distributed whistles, monitored blocks, and trusted each other to "ride right down to the house." This theme extended beyond politics: [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/is-everyone-now-148724549?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148724549&utm_id=043603bc-243f-44eb-9fec-bff2bc3167f0&utm_medium=email) examined how online performance culture affects relationships, while [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/7badb9f5?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) explored collective wisdom and crowdsourced decision-making.
