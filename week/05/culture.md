# Week 05 Culture Newsletter Analysis (January 27 - February 2, 2026)

## Overview

This week's culture coverage reveals a fractured moment where queer visibility meets political resistance, personal bodily autonomy confronts institutional gatekeeping, and media critics grapple with cultural artifacts from high literary theory to gay hockey romance. [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/c413c995?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) celebrated its second birthday while documenting Republican collusion with Russia and analyzing the permission structures in Heated Rivalry, [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/how-audiobook-149272178) explored the labor economics of audiobook narration and published ten deeply personal accounts of breast reduction and mastectomy, and [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/welcome-to-the-resistance-driving-range-guys) channeled fury about Minnesota's resistance to ICE into an essay connecting neighborhood solidarity to American values. The Browser offered its customary eclectic curation while [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-february-2/) provided sharp New Yorker criticism and a blistering takedown of centrist political advice. Across these newsletters runs a current of urgency about what bodies can do, what stories can mean, and who gets to tell them.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Political Documentation as Cultural Work
**Coverage:** [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/17a10533?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/welcome-to-the-resistance-driving-range-guys)

[Flaming Hydra's](https://flaminghydra.com/r/17a10533?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) "Puppet Show" by Maria Bustillos stands as a masterwork of archival journalism, tracking Republican affinity for Putin from George W. Bush's 2001 declaration that he could see Putin's "soul" through Trump's 2022 praise of the Ukraine invasion as "genius." The piece functions less as opinion and more as curatorial practice—letting the timeline speak for itself.

> "If the MAGA wing's true goal is to destroy Western power, culture, politics, and alliances in order to set up a one-party authoritarian state allied with Russia... their project of destruction has been entirely consistent." — [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/17a10533?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

[Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/welcome-to-the-resistance-driving-range-guys) extended this documentation impulse to the present moment, chronicling the resistance to ICE raids in Minnesota with Adam Serwer's concept of "neighborism"—the radical act of protecting people around you regardless of origin. Rusty Foster juxtaposed this against the craven capitulation of tech CEOs attending the White House premiere of a Melania Trump documentary.

The cultural work here isn't analysis—it's preservation. Both newsletters are creating records for a future that may need to understand how we got here.

### 2. Permission Structures and Queer Fulfillment
**Coverage:** [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/c413c995?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

[Annalee Newitz's meditation](https://flaminghydra.com/r/c413c995?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) on Heated Rivalry introduces a brilliant framework: the show's "permission structure" allows viewers to reimagine desire outside cultural prohibition. Newitz traces creator Jacob Tierney's evolution from playing closeted characters in Letterkenny to creating a show where "queer fulfillment" replaces queerbaiting.

> "For queer fans like me, who are sick of the hetero-pretense in other bro-centric stories, the show's opening fuck montages feel like a cure for gaslighting." — [Annalee Newitz](https://flaminghydra.com/r/c413c995?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

The piece illuminates how Heated Rivalry navigates the "complexities of the closet" without making coming out the singular narrative arc. In an era where LGBT rights face rollback, the show offers "permission to come out partially, or slowly, or not at all"—recognizing that queer joy exists independent of public declaration.

Most striking is Newitz's account of how Tierney protected his actors from forced outing during press interviews, creating real-world permission structures that mirror the show's narrative work.

### 3. The Body as Political and Personal Terrain
**Coverage:** [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/ten-detailed-of-149182415?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=149182415&utm_id=0f44da36-a5b4-4b98-aaf0-dd289009ce1a&utm_medium=email)

[Anne Helen Petersen's compilation](https://open.patreon.com/posts/ten-detailed-of-149182415?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=149182415&utm_id=0f44da36-a5b4-4b98-aaf0-dd289009ce1a&utm_medium=email) of ten first-person accounts of breast reduction and mastectomy is a landmark in service journalism. The testimonies span vastly different motivations: escape from purity culture surveillance, relief from chronic pain, cancer survival, and gender affirmation. What unites them is granular, unglamorous detail about drains, insurance battles, and the terror of anesthesia.

One respondent who had surgery for gender dysphoria shares:
> "I remember wishing I'd have breast cancer when I grew up so I wouldn't have to have breasts. I couldn't imagine any other future reality to escape having an adult female body." — [LMV via Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/ten-detailed-of-149182415?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=149182415&utm_id=0f44da36-a5b4-4b98-aaf0-dd289009ce1a&utm_medium=email)

Another, a cancer survivor, describes the emotional labor of choosing what her body would become:
> "I remember sitting in the office, holding an implant in my hand, and not feeling right... my body actually wouldn't be the same post surgery, whether my breasts were the size they had always been or not." — [JDL via Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/ten-detailed-of-149182415?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=149182415&utm_id=0f44da36-a5b4-4b98-aaf0-dd289009ce1a&utm_medium=email)

The piece refuses to flatten these experiences into a single narrative. Some report euphoria, others lingering ambivalence. Several warn against Reddit's skewed sample of extreme outcomes. The collective wisdom: take more time off than you think, go smaller than recommended, drains aren't as bad as feared, and "you have the right to feel good in your body."

### 4. Curated Intellectual Wandering
**Coverage:** [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/f9511724?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/07b25920?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/50f7a61a?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd)

[The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/f9511724?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) continued its mission of eclectic curation across multiple daily editions. Monday featured the 100th anniversary of John Logie Baird's television invention (built with "a hatbox, tea chest, darning needles and bicycle light lenses"), Eve Fairbanks debunking MAGA's fascination with South African apartheid nostalgia, the Theia hypothesis for the Moon's formation, and a comparison of self-driving car vision systems.

[Wednesday's edition](https://thebrowser.com/r/07b25920?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) ranged from Jessica Mitford's biography ("a communist who sat awkwardly in a group of sisters that included two Nazis") to private equity's "remarkable taste for British food" to the unreliability of global population data ("We simply have no idea how many people live in many of the world's countries"). [Thursday](https://thebrowser.com/r/50f7a61a?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) examined political power through Robert Caro's LBJ biography, Catholic conversion in 20th century Britain (including Evelyn Waugh and Muriel Spark), Hari Kunzru's psychogeographic walk through London, and Iran's "ultimate banned book" The Blind Owl.

The Browser's curation philosophy — "one of the secrets of a happy life is continuous small treats" (Iris Murdoch) — offers an alternative to the week's political urgency: sustained attention to the endlessly surprising texture of human knowledge and creation.

### 5. Cultural Production Under Constraint
**Coverage:** [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/how-audiobook-149272178?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=149272178&utm_id=780edf6b-54db-4fdd-9803-8226c7e15359&utm_medium=email)

[Culture Study's interview](https://open.patreon.com/posts/how-audiobook-149272178?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=149272178&utm_id=780edf6b-54db-4fdd-9803-8226c7e15359&utm_medium=email) with audiobook narrator Julia Whelan illuminates the invisible labor behind a ubiquitous art form. The conversation explores pronunciation research, vocal health, the threat of AI narration, and compensation models. Whelan has narrated over 500 books—a staggering output that raises questions about artistic sustainability.

The piece connects to broader anxieties about how artistic labor gets valued and compensated, a theme that resonates with Today in Tabs' documentation of creative workers refusing credit on the Melania Trump documentary.

### 6. Literary Criticism and Canon Wars
**Coverage:** [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-8699/), [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-february-2/), [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/7f851516?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd)

[Sam Circle's](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-february-2/) comprehensive New Yorker review included Hermione Hoby's defense of Infinite Jest at 30, which Circle reads as "the backlash to the David Foster Wallace backlash." Circle appreciates Hoby's analysis while noting problems: she's "been mislead on the subject of gooning" and her five long novels by women are all "hundreds of thousands of words shorter than IJ," weakening her comparison. The review of a review captures something essential about how canons form through accumulating discourse rather than fiat.

[The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/7f851516?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) featured Harold Bloom's rehabilitation, arguing that "with greater distance, his identification of anxiety as an engine of creative expression seems inspired." The piece suggests that "only by going through anxiety, only by naming it, learning from it, and letting it pass into and out of us, can we survive the crushing pressure of our own traditions."

[Circle's earlier review](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-8699/) of Colton Valentine's essay on Sweden's cultural canon notes that Valentine "willfully ignores that the deeper issue is not with the choosing but with the reification of authority by those choosing." Circle prefers focusing on process over product and ends with a provocative question: "what would the migrant canon look like? Surely displacement breeds cultures worth preserving, too."

### 7. Science Fiction as Mythology
**Coverage:** [Patrick Tanguay (Sentiers)](https://sentiers.media/r/6d7fca9c?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

Ken Liu's essay, featured in [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/6d7fca9c?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b), makes the case that science fiction fails at prediction but succeeds as mythology. Around 1900, 40% of American cars ran on steam, 38% on electricity, and only 22% on gasoline—nobody could have predicted which would win. Science fiction authors work "before the breakthrough that decides which competing solution wins," so they can only construct plausible worlds around their guess.

> "These modern myths become part of our vocabulary, the framework and tools with which we make sense of the impossible present and then construct the unimaginable future." — [Ken Liu via Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/6d7fca9c?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

The same [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/6d7fca9c?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b) issue featured Nate Hagens applying metaphorical thinking to technology and AI. His three metaphors: the straw (technology accelerates resource extraction), the siphon (gains concentrate as technology scales), and the sieve (wealth filters toward humans). Hagens asks what would change "if we treated speed as a risk variable rather than an unquestioned virtue?"

### 8. Media Gatekeeping and Democratic Collapse
**Coverage:** [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-february-2/)

[Circle's](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-february-2/) most passionate response was to Charles Duhigg's piece suggesting Democrats should copy MAGA tactics, "operate more like a business," and de-emphasize abortion and LGBTQ rights. Circle's takedown is brutal and necessary:

> "I have to admit, this piece makes me furious, and it's short-circuiting my ability to be concise and precise. Does Duhigg really think pluralism is such a liability it must be abandoned? Does he really think unity can be so easily engineered? Does he really see no hope for solidarity? Is he, maybe, just afraid?" — [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-february-2/)

Circle reads Duhigg's piece as "born of deep cowardice, as Duhigg faces rising fascism and decides we can only beat the bully by joining him." The counterpoint is Adam Serwer's Atlantic piece on Minnesota (extensively quoted in [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/welcome-to-the-resistance-driving-range-guys)), which shows real solidarity emerging from diverse communities protecting each other.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Bodily Autonomy as Contested Ground**
Multiple newsletters circled the question of who controls bodies. [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/ten-detailed-of-149182415?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=149182415&utm_id=0f44da36-a5b4-4b98-aaf0-dd289009ce1a&utm_medium=email) presented first-person accounts of surgical self-determination, [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/c413c995?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) explored queer desire under surveillance, and [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/welcome-to-the-resistance-driving-range-guys) documented state violence against immigrant bodies. [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/93a22131?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) also examined how RFK Jr.'s anti-vaccine crusade threatens public health autonomy. The through-line: in 2026, choosing how to inhabit your own body remains a radical, precarious act.

**Permission Structures and Gatekeeping**
[Newitz's concept](https://flaminghydra.com/r/c413c995?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) of "permission structures" — how Heated Rivalry creates space for queer desire and how director Jacob Tierney gave actors permission to come out on their own terms — resonates across the week. [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/ten-detailed-of-149182415) respondents described seeking permission from insurance companies, surgeons, and ultimately themselves. [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/welcome-to-the-resistance-driving-range-guys) celebrates Minnesotans giving themselves permission to protect neighbors. [Sam Circle's](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-the-weekend-special-8699/) review of Sweden's canon project asks whether national solidarity can exist without exclusion—who grants permission to belong.

**Mythology vs. Reality**
From [science fiction's mythological function](https://sentiers.media/r/6d7fca9c?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b) (Ken Liu argues sf creates enduring metaphors rather than accurate predictions) to [the myth of South African persecution](https://thebrowser.com/r/f9511724?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) of white citizens to [vaccine-autism mythology](https://flaminghydra.com/r/93a22131?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) becoming government policy, multiple pieces examined how narratives shape reality and whose interests those narratives serve. [Flaming Hydra's](https://flaminghydra.com/r/f11abec2?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) Tal Lavin coined "Obligatory Heterosexual Interlude" to describe how films construct heterosexual mythology by inserting disposable female love interests.

**Documentation as Resistance**
In a moment of historical acceleration, multiple newsletters shifted toward archival work. [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/17a10533?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) created a timeline of Republican-Russia relations, [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/welcome-to-the-resistance-driving-range-guys) preserved accounts of Minnesota resistance, [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/ten-detailed-of-149182415?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=149182415&utm_id=0f44da36-a5b4-4b98-aaf0-dd289009ce1a&utm_medium=email) collected surgical experiences. [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-february-2/) documented media fraud and institutional failure. The act of recording becomes a form of care—evidence that these events happened, these people existed, these choices mattered.

**The Comfort of Small Things**
Amidst political crisis, several newsletters found solace in granular observation. [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/07b25920?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) featured an essay on designing a font inspired by San Francisco transit typography. [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/ten-detailed-of-149182415?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=149182415&utm_id=0f44da36-a5b4-4b98-aaf0-dd289009ce1a&utm_medium=email) respondents celebrated "no boob sweat this summer" and buying bras at Target. [The Browser's](https://thebrowser.com/r/50f7a61a?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) Henrik Karlsson examined LBJ's understanding that political power comes from accumulating tiny advantages: "Every drop adds up." There's defiance in attending to the texture of daily life when catastrophe demands total attention.

**Institutional Failure and Elite Cowardice**
[Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/welcome-to-the-resistance-driving-range-guys) documented Jeff Bezos destroying the Washington Post while Amazon CEO attended the Melania Trump documentary premiere, [Sam Circle](https://buttondown.com/lastweeksnewyorker/archive/last-weeks-new-yorker-review-february-2/) exposed a celebrated researcher's decades of medical fraud, and [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/07b25920?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) examined how "good population data is hard to come by" because census-taking is "expensive, difficult and, often, politically fraught." Circle's takedown of Charles Duhigg's advice to Democrats captured the week's theme: facing authoritarianism, too many elites choose "deep cowardice" over solidarity.

## Notable Quotes

> "As the Republican Party sides ever more boldly and openly with Russia against Europe, the world's chances of preserving democracy, women's rights and LGBTQ rights, voting rights, press freedom, education, freedom of information, and individual liberty will continue to slip away." — [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/17a10533?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

> "This is the opposite of queerbaiting, where queer desire is hinted at only in subtext—or aroused only in order to have it snatched away. This is queer fulfillment." — [Annalee Newitz, Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/c413c995?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

> "You have the right to feel good in your body. You don't have to live with your breasts for the rest of your life just because you know you're capable of it." — [ZC via Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/ten-detailed-of-149182415?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=149182415&utm_id=0f44da36-a5b4-4b98-aaf0-dd289009ce1a&utm_medium=email)

> "How can we reconcile living our lives with such openness, such abundant kindness, but governing ourselves with such fear and hate?" — [Rusty Foster, Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/welcome-to-the-resistance-driving-range-guys)

> "The secret fear of the morally depraved is that virtue is actually common, and that they're the ones who are alone." — [Adam Serwer via Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/welcome-to-the-resistance-driving-range-guys)
