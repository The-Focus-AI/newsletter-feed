# Week 05 Politics Newsletter Analysis (January 20-28, 2026)

## Overview

Week 05 marked a dramatic escalation in both Trump's foreign policy aggression and domestic immigration enforcement, sending shockwaves through U.S. alliances and financial markets. [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/gFDQYMGPAK?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported stocks tumbling as Trump's Greenland threats triggered what traders called the return of the "Sell America" trade, while [The Atlantic Daily](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2026/01/a-surprising-change-in-trump-s-behavior/685658/) observed a surprising shift in Trump's behavior—his newfound willingness to follow through on previously empty threats. By week's end, two fatal ICE shootings in Minneapolis sparked national outrage and political backlash, with [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-is-losing-normies-on-immigration) noting Trump was "losing normies on immigration" as his approval ratings declined. The week culminated in Trump partially backing down on Greenland at Davos while facing mounting pressure on multiple fronts.

Trump's week-long campaign to acquire Greenland through economic and military threats created the most severe transatlantic crisis in modern memory. [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/gFDQYMGPAK?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported that US stocks suffered their worst day since October on Tuesday as Trump threatened Denmark with tariffs over Greenland, with traders' willingness to shrug off geopolitical shocks "beginning to erode."

> "A country will tolerate a lot of economic misery rather than giving up territory." — [The Wall Street Journal](https://semafor.com/s/7dQV1QamKQ?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

The crisis revealed deep fissures in the U.S.-led order. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney warned at Davos of a "rupture" in the global system, with [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/baJ4N5eN3Q?email=wschenk@gmail.com) noting his speech focused on Trump using "economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion." European leaders initially tried appeasement, but [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/gFDQYMGPAK?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported growing calls to "fight back" rather than "roll over."

[Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/wQr0S1hN9zua8d7RC7RY9P8TZL3yTfxIFOmjGQNP03UXd41aMvcSwxBMSdyuTT5rSQ2lYl4-D_AIXwej43P9W19_uu1umgWM8_hTt4WMj_TxtfuAySOX8omGedECd4-ZmmPYwTL23YJ1MnkAylq1N-7At5yds0eCP5E-i5ODToSI59ThIsNiRrcfxaVFrvNEhNINOo0i2U4Q2XJrFMAfkOXfHF5WyyDAWKWfb6FTWiliPcfRBRMX08k-nB6EXMVCoajC5nSRTDA8QFmn274dWU1tjMknsBV6jZ__QpNb4PPSkXbRcLk1WdG4zrmTv-Ng5MGOyxgnt0l-3XjX0TSlNhtbA-co8rqutq9PWh81JGFgxV4toVB-9VLxKw/wC2b-pcIQFOcM07ZlFhRG8xcUs7S02nn/17) captured the market panic, reporting Denmark's largest pension fund selling $100 million in US Treasury bonds, with its CIO warning: "You cannot put the genie back into the bottle." Bridgewater's Ray Dalio told [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/TUNxZVQs3H?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that $9 trillion in foreign-held U.S. debt represents an "enormous vulnerability."

[The Atlantic Daily](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2026/01/a-surprising-change-in-trump-s-behavior/685658/) identified the crisis as evidence of a fundamental shift: Trump was no longer bluffing. During his first term, the pattern was clear—he "almost always folded." Now, European leaders were "coming to the conclusion that this isn't just a feint."

By week's end, Trump partially backed down at Davos, announcing a vague "framework of a future deal" with NATO. [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/JipT2h2IvY?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported "relief" in markets, though the damage to transatlantic trust appeared lasting.

### 2. Minneapolis ICE Shootings and Immigration Backlash
**Coverage:** [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-is-losing-normies-on-immigration), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/oNVXcc8TM6?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [The Atlantic Daily](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2026/01/minneapolis-is-a-second-amendment-wake-up-call/685664/)

The week was dominated by two fatal ICE shootings of civilians in Minneapolis, triggering what [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-is-losing-normies-on-immigration) called a turning point in public opinion on immigration enforcement. On January 7, ICE agents shot Renee Good in her vehicle. On January 25, they killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who was filming a confrontation—shooting him "at least 10 times" after his gun was already removed, according to [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/oNVXcc8TM6?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

The White House's response backfired spectacularly. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem called Good a "domestic terrorist," while Trump initially claimed she "violently, willfully and viciously ran over the ICE officer." After public backlash, Trump belatedly called it "a horrible thing," but policy advisor Stephen Miller doubled down after Pretti's killing, calling him an "assassin [who] tried to murder federal agents."

[Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-is-losing-normies-on-immigration) documented the political damage: Trump's net approval on immigration declined 4 points since Good's death, with the gap between his immigration ratings and overall approval "mostly evaporated." Polling showed 82% of respondents had seen video of the Good incident, and only 24% strongly approved of Trump's performance overall.

> "Unlike with Abrego Garcia, there's video here... Many Americans aren't sympathetic to armed, poorly-trained ICE officers roaming city streets" — [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-is-losing-normies-on-immigration)

[Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/oNVXcc8TM6?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported that more than 60 CEOs called for "immediate de-escalation," while Democrats threatened to partially shut down the federal government by blocking DHS funding. The incidents exposed ICE agents as "visibly unprepared to handle the policing situations their presence created," according to [The New York Times](https://semafor.com/s/IBsHADBMmm?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

### 3. Federal Reserve Independence Under Attack
**Coverage:** [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/ZJkUGOQPs5?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/NWDnLmA1WU?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/wQr0S1hN9zua8d7RC7RY9P8TZL3yTfxIFOmjGQNP03UXd41aMvcSwxBMSdyuTT5rSQ2lYl4-D_AIXwej43P9W19_uu1umgWM8_hTt4WMj_TxtfuAySOX8omGedECd4-ZmmPYwTL23YJ1MnkAylq1N-7At5yds0eCP5E-i5ODToSI59ThIsNiRrcfxaVFrvNEhNINOo0i2U4Q2XJrFMAfkOXfHF5WyyDAWKWfb6FTWiliPcfRBRMX08k-nB6EXMVCoajC5nSRTDA8QFmn274dWU1tjMknsBV6jZ__QpNb4PPSkXbRcLk1WdG4zrmTv-Ng5MGOyxgnt0l-3XjX0TSlNhtbA-co8rqutq9PWh81JGFgxV4toVB-9VLxKw/wC2b-pcIQFOcM07ZlFhRG8xcUs7S02nn/17)

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in what [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/ZJkUGOQPs5?email=wschenk@gmail.com) called "one of the highest-profile cases of a jam-packed session." The case centered on Trump's effort to remove Cook over unproven mortgage fraud allegations, part of his broader assault on Fed independence.

The oral arguments suggested Trump would lose. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, warned that a "low bar for cause" in firing officials "would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve." Even conservative Justice Samuel Alito sounded skeptical of the "hurried manner" of litigation. [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/NWDnLmA1WU?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported that "the justices seemed to be debating how to rule in Cook's favor, rather than whether to do so."

> "It's no exaggeration to say that the economic and constitutional foundations of the country are on trial in this case." — Former Treasury adviser via [The Washington Post](https://semafor.com/s/f4CJowNjtQ?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

Trump's attacks on Fed independence earned criticism from Republican lawmakers concerned about economic consequences. The broader implications extended to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized and whom the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into on "dubious premises," according to [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-is-losing-normies-on-immigration).

### 4. Trump's Year One Pattern: Follow-Through vs. Backing Down
**Coverage:** [The Atlantic Daily](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2026/01/a-surprising-change-in-trump-s-behavior/685658/), [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/were-the-resistance-libs-right-about), [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/JipT2h2IvY?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

Week 05 crystallized a year-long pattern analysts had been tracking: Trump was following through on threats in ways he never did during his first term. [The Atlantic Daily](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2026/01/a-surprising-change-in-trump-s-behavior/685658/) devoted extensive analysis to this shift, noting that in 2018, foreign leaders realized "Trump is a pushover"—he "almost always folded" in negotiations. Wall Street even created the "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out).

But the pattern had broken. Trump followed through on military action in Venezuela, capturing President Nicolás Maduro despite expectations he would back down. He maintained ICE enforcement in Minneapolis despite political costs. And while he eventually moderated on Greenland, he pushed the crisis further than observers thought possible.

[Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/were-the-resistance-libs-right-about) evaluated predictions about Trump's second term, finding a mixed record. Some worst-case scenarios hadn't materialized, but Trump's unpopularity (with only 24% strongly approving) meant he was "more dangerous if he were more popular," contrary to the view that an "increasingly unpopular regime is rapidly radicalizing."

The week showed both patterns coexisting: Trump backing down on Greenland while doubling down on Minneapolis. [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/JipT2h2IvY?email=wschenk@gmail.com) quoted John Bolton saying "Trump plays these things by the seat of his pants. There's no grand strategy at work here."

### 5. Economic Security and China Competition
**Coverage:** [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-future-of-economic-security-with), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/baJ4N5eN3Q?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/oNVXcc8TM6?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

A lengthy [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-future-of-economic-security-with) interview with former CHIPS Program Office Chief Economist Dan Kim and Chris Miller explored fundamental questions about economic security that policymakers still haven't resolved. Kim revealed that with $39 billion, the CHIPS Act "couldn't de-risk from China and Taiwan completely" and "even if I could, why would you?"

The conversation highlighted tensions between efficiency and resilience, wartime versus peacetime planning, and whether the U.S. should emulate China's "fast follower" model (Xiaomi, BYD) or stick with high-value innovation (Apple, Nvidia). Kim argued for "managed dependence" rather than autarky, noting that "semiconductor success relies on international partnerships."

Meanwhile, geopolitical competition intensified. [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/oNVXcc8TM6?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported China's top general was ousted after being accused of leaking nuclear secrets to the U.S., while a new Pentagon strategy "deprioritized China as the military's top threat," shifting focus to the Western Hemisphere. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned at Davos that allowing Nvidia to manufacture AI chips for China had "incredible national security implications," equating it to "selling nuclear weapons to North Korea."

### 6. Davos as Theater of American Decline
**Coverage:** [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/baJ4N5eN3Q?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/P8lxjzNEEB?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Emma Tucker, WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/trumps-threats-to-allies-stir-worry-that-u-s-has-lost-its-way-6bc05fcb), [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/JipT2h2IvY?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

The World Economic Forum in Davos became a stage for competing visions of the global order. Trump's appearance was delayed by an "electrical issue," but his eventual speech and dealings dominated coverage. He announced his "Board of Peace," a UN alternative that [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/IJmcd76W0L?email=wschenk@gmail.com) noted used a logo "that closely resembled the UN's."

Allied leaders used Davos to push back. Canada's Carney earned a standing ovation for warning the "rules-based order is fading." France's Macron echoed that the U.S. was seeking to "subordinate Europe." California Governor Gavin Newsom told [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/cQ9N8kzeiU?email=wschenk@gmail.com) that Trump is an "invasive species" but America's global leadership was merely "in dormancy."

China seized the moment to court frustrated U.S. allies. [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/baJ4N5eN3Q?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported Britain, Canada, and Germany were pursuing warmer ties with Beijing, with the UK approving China's "mega-embassy" in London despite security concerns.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The "America First" Paradox
Multiple newsletters documented how Trump's aggressive unilateralism was driving allies toward China and undermining American economic interests. [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/baJ4N5eN3Q?email=wschenk@gmail.com) captured this in reporting how frustrated allies were "look[ing] to capitalize on US-fueled geopolitical disruption to repair and deepen" relationships with Beijing. [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/wQr0S1hN9zua8d7RC7RY9P8TZL3yTfxIFOmjGQNP03UXd41aMvcSwxBMSdyuTT5rSQ2lYl4-D_AIXwej43P9W19_uu1umgWM8_hTt4WMj_TxtfuAySOX8omGedECd4-ZmmPYwTL23YJ1MnkAylq1N-7At5yds0eCP5E-i5ODToSI59ThIsNiRrcfxaVFrvNEhNINOo0i2U4Q2XJrFMAfkOXfHF5WyyDAWKWfb6FTWiliPcfRBRMX08k-nB6EXMVCoajC5nSRTDA8QFmn274dWU1tjMknsBV6jZ__QpNb4PPSkXbRcLk1WdG4zrmTv-Ng5MGOyxgnt0l-3XjX0TSlNhtbA-co8rqutq9PWh81JGFgxV4toVB-9VLxKw/wC2b-pcIQFOcM07ZlFhRG8xcUs7S02nn/17) quoted a Danish pension fund executive warning that once trust is broken, "what comes then in five, six, 10 years?"

### Video as Political Game-Changer
The Minneapolis shootings highlighted how video evidence shapes public opinion in ways traditional media narratives cannot. [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-is-losing-normies-on-immigration) emphasized that video made the White House's "gaslighting" ineffective: "Unlike with Abrego Garcia, there's video here." The incidents showed what happens when administration spin collides with visual evidence accessible to all voters.

### Institutional Resilience Questions
Across multiple topics—the Fed, ICE operations, international alliances—the week raised questions about institutional capacity to check executive power. [The Atlantic Daily](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2026/01/a-surprising-change-in-trump-s-behavior/685658/) noted that while "with some overlooked exceptions, the Congress and courts haven't resisted Trump as much as I'd like," some pushback was emerging. The Supreme Court's apparent reluctance to support Cook's firing and Republican criticism of Fed interference suggested limits to Trump's influence.

### The Unsolved Economic Security Puzzle
[ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-future-of-economic-security-with)'s interview revealed that fundamental questions about economic security remain unanswered: How do you measure it? What's the optimal level of dependence on allies versus adversaries? Should the U.S. optimize for innovation or resilience? As Dan Kim noted, "I would love for there to be more discussion of how to measure economic security... That discussion just doesn't happen, even in forums like this."
