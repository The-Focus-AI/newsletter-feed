# Week 05 Politics Newsletter Analysis (January 27-February 2, 2026)

## Overview

Week 05's dominant political story was the Trump administration's forced Minnesota pivot following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen and ICU nurse, which triggered rare Republican criticism that compelled Trump to recalibrate his aggressive immigration enforcement strategy. [The Atlantic Daily](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2026/01/27/how-republicans-forced-trump-to-shift-course-in-minnesota) reported that "silence and acquiescence" gave way to a flood of GOP statements demanding investigations, while [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/dG4wBrZSoFrVGuRBYw3-rzooRHocdZ-zias6DCzmip23A3KsnhzFeJLQj367SoyN8_QGkLGKtkdHS8cSMvF2IRh60FF5rjcRcLqJBCx5CA6T2bnUkB4llONTynBLfPkYADiGHrzTuYnogYXQ3fQRGfa4xhD8lnCFTAyKSmZa0rppWgA16mUBY0alboCkdI98XrNY4mkU5pRSnO_32EXyjWF2ruWBkPa2a6B5U3-AsEQvofd7iDFt_nx6w_jCU0PK2H3aWvE76shvIED6O_5klZ9zWcX7MKnR7Um9vuAKnLXh-wnX_zB47ENVcB6zKPH9DeEhPe3_uIeDZf3JCMEul23ADxAVhnb8cScS6xpSPUZ2QujHE5-7spqTJQ/ych4yLrgJdTMDRzXJQhgecQD7ONdxyGF/17) documented plummeting consumer confidence to 12-year lows. Meanwhile, [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/party-time-jon-czin-on-us-china-2025) and [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/will-china-replace-the-united-states) explored shifting U.S.-China relations, with the latter arguing Trump has delivered "the death blow to the American order" as allies like Canada sign major trade deals with Beijing.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Trump's Minnesota Immigration Pivot
**Coverage:** [The Atlantic Daily](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2026/01/27/how-republicans-forced-trump-to-shift-course-in-minnesota), [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/2TAZiEKNxr?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Emma Tucker, WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/the-48-hours-that-convinced-trump-to-change-course-in-minnesota-a91d7683), [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/dG4wBrZSoFrVGuRBYw3-rzooRHocdZ-zias6DCzmip23A3KsnhzFeJLQj367SoyN8_QGkLGKtkdHS8cSMvF2IRh60FF5rjcRcLqJBCx5CA6T2bnUkB4llONTynBLfPkYADiGHrzTuYnogYXQ3fQRGfa4xhD8lnCFTAyKSmZa0rppWgA16mUBY0alboCkdI98XrNY4mkU5pRSnO_32EXyjWF2ruWBkPa2a6B5U3-AsEQvofd7iDFt_nx6w_jCU0PK2H3aWvE76shvIED6O_5klZ9zWcX7MKnR7Um9vuAKnLXh-wnX_zB47ENVcB6zKPH9DeEhPe3_uIeDZf3JCMEul23ADxAVhnb8cScS6xpSPUZ2QujHE5-7spqTJQ/ych4yLrgJdTMDRzXJQhgecQD7ONdxyGF/17), [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2026/01/27/the-minneapolis-effect-atlantic-writers-on-the-killings-in-minnesota)

In what [WSJ called](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/the-48-hours-that-convinced-trump-to-pivot-in-minnesota-a91d7683) "48 hours that convinced Trump to pivot," the Trump administration dramatically changed course in Minnesota after federal immigration agents killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse and U.S. citizen. The shooting followed the earlier killing of Renee Good on January 7, generating a wave of bipartisan Republican criticism rarely seen during Trump's second term.

> "I cannot support the national Republicans' stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so." — Chris Madel, former Minnesota GOP gubernatorial candidate, announcing his withdrawal from the race, [via Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/tsErTOUZfU?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

[The Atlantic Daily](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2026/01/27/how-republicans-forced-trump-to-shift-course-in-minnesota) reported that the "defining characteristics of the Republican-controlled Congress during the president's second term have been silence and acquiescence," making the volume of GOP statements "a sign that Republicans had finally lost patience." Republican committee chairs in both the House and Senate summoned administration officials to public hearings. The NRA criticized FBI Director Kash Patel for blaming Pretti for carrying a firearm, noting that video evidence showed [agents disarmed Pretti before shooting him](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2026/01/25/minneapolis-shooting-video-gun/).

Trump grew concerned at the response, particularly the NRA's criticism, according to [The Atlantic Daily](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2026/01/27/how-republicans-forced-trump-to-shift-course-in-minnesota). He appointed "border czar" Tom Homan to head the Minnesota operation and ousted Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino from his role as "commander at large," as [The Atlantic's Nick Miroff first reported](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/greg-bovino-demoted-minneapolis-border-patrol/685770/). White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that if local officials increased cooperation, Border Patrol agents would "no longer be needed" in Minnesota.

[Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/dG4wBrZSoFrVGuRBYw3-rzooRHocdZ-zias6DCzmip23A3KsnhzFeJLQj367SoyN8_QGkLGKtkdHS8cSMvF2IRh60FF5rjcRcLqJBCx5CA6T2bnUkB4llONTynBLfPkYADiGHrzTuYnogYXQ3fQRGfa4xhD8lnCFTAyKSmZa0rppWgA16mUBY0alboCkdI98XrNY4mkU5pRSnO_32EXyjWF2ruWBkPa2a6B5U3-AsEQvofd7iDFt_nx6w_jCU0PK2H3aWvE76shvIED6O_5klZ9zWcX7MKnR7Um9vuAKnLXh-wnX_zB47ENVcB6zKPH9DeEhPe3_uIeDZf3JCMEul23ADxAVhnb8cScS6xpSPUZ2QujHE5-7spqTJQ/ych4yLrgJdTMDRzXJQhgecQD7ONdxyGF/17) noted that despite the pivot, the administration announced there would be no civil rights probe of Pretti's killing, and Trump defended the victim-blaming of Alex Pretti for possessing a licensed firearm.

### 2. U.S. Consumer Confidence Plummets
**Coverage:** [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/dG4wBrZSoFrVGuRBYw3-rzooRHocdZ-zias6DCzmip23A3KsnhzFeJLQj367SoyN8_QGkLGKtkdHS8cSMvF2IRh60FF5rjcRcLqJBCx5CA6T2bnUkB4llONTynBLfPkYADiGHrzTuYnogYXQ3fQRGfa4xhD8lnCFTAyKSmZa0rppWgA16mUBY0alboCkdI98XrNY4mkU5pRSnO_32EXyjWF2ruWBkPa2a6B5U3-AsEQvofd7iDFt_nx6w_jCU0PK2H3aWvE76shvIED6O_5klZ9zWcX7MKnR7Um9vuAKnLXh-wnX_zB47ENVcB6zKPH9DeEhPe3_uIeDZf3JCMEul23ADxAVhnb8cScS6xpSPUZ2QujHE5-7spqTJQ/ych4yLrgJdTMDRzXJQhgecQD7ONdxyGF/17), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/h7D8j3fqxl?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

U.S. consumer confidence plummeted to its lowest level in 12 years, [Bloomberg reported](https://bloom.bg/4k9yeyY). The Conference Board gauge decreased to 84.5 from 94.2, missing all economist estimates as Americans grew anxious about inflation, high prices, and a weakening labor market stuck in a "low hire, low fire" environment.

> "This is a warning sign to policymakers to focus on affordability and reviving hiring." — Economist quoted in [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/8ETxIQo0L2?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

[Semafor](https://semafor.com/s/IVITTff3y2?email=wschenk@gmail.com) noted that geopolitical shocks fueled by Trump's volatile foreign policy also weighed on consumer sentiment. The share of consumers saying jobs were "hard to get" reached its highest since February 2021, while fewer Americans expect their incomes to rise. Mentions of prices for oil, gas, groceries, politics, the labor market, and health insurance all rose in write-in survey responses, according to [Bloomberg](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/dG4wBrZSoFrVGuRBYw3-rzooRHocdZ-zias6DCzmip23A3KsnhzFeJLQj367SoyN8_QGkLGKtkdHS8cSMvF2IRh60FF5rjcRcLqJBCx5CA6T2bnUkB4llONTynBLfPkYADiGHrzTuYnogYXQ3fQRGfa4xhD8lnCFTAyKSmZa0rppWgA16mUBY0alboCkdI98XrNY4mkU5pRSnO_32EXyjWF2ruWBkPa2a6B5U3-AsEQvofd7iDFt_nx6w_jCU0PK2H3aWvE76shvIED6O_5klZ9zWcX7MKnR7Um9vuAKnLXh-wnX_zB47ENVcB6zKPH9DeEhPe3_uIeDZf3JCMEul23ADxAVhnb8cScS6xpSPUZ2QujHE5-7spqTJQ/ych4yLrgJdTMDRzXJQhgecQD7ONdxyGF/17).

The economic pessimism extended to currency markets, where [Bloomberg](https://bloom.bg/49TwGWl) reported dollar traders were paying record premiums to bet on a deeper selloff in the greenback "as an increasingly destabilized US triggers a rush into bearish hedges." When asked about the dollar's decline, Trump responded "I think it's great."

### 3. U.S.-China Relations: From "Phony War" to Pragmatic Détente
**Coverage:** [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/party-time-jon-czin-on-us-china-2025), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/h7D8j3fqxl?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/will-china-replace-the-united-states)

[ChinaTalk's interview with Jon Czin](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/party-time-jon-czin-on-us-china-2025) of Brookings characterized 2025 as "the year of living quietly" in U.S.-China relations. After Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs and China's rare earth retaliation showed both sides' leverage, the relationship entered a stable détente aimed at lasting through U.S. midterms. Czin argues China has learned it can use "escalate to de-escalate" tactics effectively, shifting from defense to offense.

> "China has effectively whittled down the conversation to a question of scoping. We are now talking about specific sectors, products like soybeans, or firms like TikTok. We are not talking about big macroeconomic imbalances." — Jon Czin, [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/party-time-jon-czin-on-us-china-2025)

[Semafor](https://semafor.com/s/BNHjzBKQFm?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported that U.S. Ambassador David Perdue told business leaders in Hong Kong that the U.S. and China had made progress on agreements including a massive Boeing sale, ahead of Trump's expected April trip to China. Perdue said the broader U.S.-China relationship was "improving multi-dimensionally," while other Western nations also pursued closer ties with Beijing amid Trump's trade policies.

**Canada's Strategic Pivot to China**

[The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/will-china-replace-the-united-states) offered a comprehensive—and pessimistic—analysis arguing that Trump has delivered "the death blow to the American order." Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's new "strategic partnership" with China serves as exhibit one. After visiting Beijing, Carney signed a "landmark" deal removing trade barriers and reducing tariffs, reversing years of alignment with U.S. policy.

> "We take the world as it is—not as we wish it to be." — Mark Carney on China's human rights record, [via The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/will-china-replace-the-united-states)

The deal extends beyond rhetoric: China will make major investments in Canadian clean energy, agriculture, and infrastructure. Canada will ship more crude oil, LNG, and petroleum products to China. China granted visa-free travel for Canadians and approved-destination status for Chinese travelers. [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/will-china-replace-the-united-states) noted this marks the beginning of a fundamental realignment, with France, South Korea, Ireland, and the UK also scheduling Beijing visits and signing cooperation agreements.

### 4. The Hegemonic Transition Thesis
**Coverage:** [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/will-china-replace-the-united-states)

Claire Berlinski's expansive essay in [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/will-china-replace-the-united-states) argues that we're witnessing not a temporary disruption but an irreversible hegemonic transition. Drawing on historical examples from Athens to the Soviet Union, she argues that "a hegemon typically wants allies as buffers" and only turns predatory "when they're under great pressure to extract short-term value to sustain themselves."

> "Trump's demand violated a law so fundamental to the Western alliance system that no one ever bothered to put it in writing. That intra-alliance predation was prohibited went without saying... The taboo has now been broken, and this can't be undone." — [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/will-china-replace-the-united-states)

The essay catalogs a comprehensive list of ways the American order has unraveled: the 2019 Aramco attack that revealed U.S. security guarantees were "optional"; the abandonment of the TPP; weaponization of the dollar; China's infrastructure investments replacing American presence; and the rise of alternative payment systems and currency swaps. The Gulf states have moved from US Treasuries to global equities. India practices nonalignment. Southeast Asia has stopped waiting for America to return.

> "Americans will come to understand, painfully, that the world has ceased to admire them. Admiration is a toxic nutrient; once you've metabolized it, withdrawal is agonizing." — [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/will-china-replace-the-united-states)

### 5. Climate Policy and Energy Geopolitics
**Coverage:** [Bill McKibben](https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/time-for-some-courage-in-the-climate), [Semafor Energy](https://semafor.com/s/In1kym7quJ?email=wschenk@gmail.com), [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/b0aba520?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637), [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/h7D8j3fqxl?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

[Bill McKibben](https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/time-for-some-courage-in-the-climate) celebrated the Minneapolis resistance, then pivoted to climate policy, arguing New York's comptroller race offers an opportunity for fossil fuel divestment. He cited a report showing failure to divest has cost New York taxpayers $15 billion in foregone returns over two decades.

[Semafor Energy](https://semafor.com/s/In1kym7quJ?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported the global energy picture shifting in multiple directions: brutal U.S. cold weather drove natural gas prices up globally, showcasing growing dependence on American LNG exports. Ten European countries announced plans for 100 GW of offshore wind power in the North Sea—enough for 143 million homes—defying Trump's demands to stop building wind power. The Trump administration cancelled nearly $30 billion in Energy Department green bank financing approved under Biden.

Meanwhile, [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/h7D8j3fqxl?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported aggressive government spending in wealthy countries is propping up global economic growth but poses threats to long-term financial stability, with record debt raising questions about ability to weather future crises.

[Tracy Stone-Manning wrote in Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/b0aba520?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) about running the Bureau of Land Management, describing the "megafire" of budget cuts and layoffs hitting federal land management—but seeing potential for "a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rethink and rebuild" the system.

### 6. Media and Institutional Decline
**Coverage:** [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-sad-and-self-inflicted-decline), [The Chronicle of Higher Education](https://links2.newsletter.chronicle.com/s/c/D8g5LEOL_-6mPRVhyOnBf5s2vEOP-ggqv1EFqnsUgwZrR3gouq6Y37bHIs3cx20W-KoFBEYJisnbD59I0bKHAxJAEqXhZtcdbqNwAVTcEReGpgYPpkKIKLW1HG0yTYFn7kZsE4K0RfrA9rUhhHz0Vbq_mbzbioFX8G_94wOO2QvE-1I-cC4zF_2xa2cjMVdKb9JWY2AtHo1J3jmjs9dvd60xrUqMgqQe-4Z_hb5XtJTx5yyrCnOReZx07ecAFpWlI2wM-YjQoRdlM5KbAEQKBjKrGyXNaL6L94uFWUliEOLziQD902V26bdgnwlTg8Dga8rGrTjkMbL16lRtLgQE26h50WTxHWzycZF8fFiXxYuMlmqW3myQXIuZuV1c0bjmbh7-v-5B6v_2evMFYJC_SKRIBzNjgV6mYB474Vf9m6WUxj65yltC/oLfdw-DGsrZWodDSuj_ofK7lBfNJXd1q/17), [Bloomberg Weekend](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/dG4wBrZSoFrVGuRBYw3-rzooRHocdZ-zias6DCzmip23A3KsnhzFeJLQj367SoyN8_QGkLGKtkdHS8cSMvF2IRh60FF5rjcRcLqJBCx5CA6T2bnUkB4llONTynBLfPkYADiGHrzTuYnogYXQ3fQRGfa4xhD8lnCFTAyKSmZa0rppWgA16mUBY0alboCkdI98XrNY4mkU5pRSnO_32EXyjWF2ruWBkPa2a6B5U3-AsEQvofd7iDFt_nx6w_jCU0PK2H3aWvE76shvIED6O_5klZ9zWcX7MKnR7Um9vuAKnLXh-wnX_zB47ENVcB6zKPH9DeEhPe3_uIeDZf3JCMEul23ADxAVhnb8cScS6xpSPUZ2QujHE5-7spqTJQ/ych4yLrgJdTMDRzXJQhgecQD7ONdxyGF/17)

[Nate Silver analyzed](https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-sad-and-self-inflicted-decline) the "sad and self-inflicted decline" of The Washington Post using Memeorandum data showing the Post's political news "mindshare" has collapsed from parity with The New York Times four years ago to just 5% today (versus 14% for the Times).

> "The Post rebuilt its brand from subscribers who wanted unflinching coverage of Trump, and then it pulled the rug out." — [Nate Silver](https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-sad-and-self-inflicted-decline)

Silver attributed this to Jeff Bezos's decision to quash the Harris endorsement, followed by mass subscriber cancellations (250,000, about 10% of digital subscribers), columnist departures, and a pivot away from progressive readers. The Post is reportedly considering major layoffs and has cancelled plans to send reporters to the Winter Olympics (later reversed).

[The Chronicle](https://www.chronicle.com/article/this-state-has-plenty-of-money-its-weighing-cuts-to-its-only-public-university-anyway) reported that the University of Wyoming faces a $40 million proposed cut despite the state being "flush with money," with legislators arguing the campus "has forgotten its founding purpose." Congress is asking universities about students' "dismal" math skills. [Bloomberg reported](https://bloom.bg/4qIeZi5) that Yale expanded tuition-free access to families making under $200,000, matching Harvard's affordability moves.

### 7. Silicon Valley's Tightrope on Minneapolis
**Coverage:** [Semafor Flagship](https://semafor.com/s/h7D8j3fqxl?email=wschenk@gmail.com)

[Semafor](https://semafor.com/s/h7D8j3fqxl?email=wschenk@gmail.com) reported that hundreds of U.S. tech workers were speaking out about the deadly immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, but most of Silicon Valley's top CEOs remained silent. OpenAI's Sam Altman told employees ICE operations were "going too far," while Anthropic's CEO characterized the situation as "horror"—but both couched their condemnation with praise for Trump, reflecting the "tightrope tech chiefs are walking."

More than 800 employees from Google, Microsoft, and Meta called on their bosses to condemn ICE, but many in AI preferred staying quiet to "getting dragged into the mind-killing field that is politics," according to the Transformer newsletter cited by [Semafor](https://semafor.com/s/h7D8j3fqxl?email=wschenk@gmail.com).

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**The Minneapolis Effect:** Nearly every political newsletter covered the Minnesota shootings and Trump's pivot, but from different angles. [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2026/01/27/the-minneapolis-effect-atlantic-writers-on-the-killings-in-minnesota) provided the most comprehensive coverage with multiple articles calling it "The Minneapolis Effect," [Semafor DC](https://semafor.com/s/2TAZiEKNxr?email=wschenk@gmail.com) emphasized insider White House dynamics, while [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/the-48-hours-that-convinced-trump-to-pivot-in-minnesota-a91d7683) focused on the "48 hours" that changed Trump's mind. The event was notable for breaking the pattern of Republican congressional silence that has characterized Trump's second term.

**U.S.-China Strategic Shift:** Both [ChinaTalk](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/party-time-jon-czin-on-us-china-2025) and [The Cosmopolitan Globalist](https://claireberlinski.substack.com/p/will-china-replace-the-united-states) explored the same fundamental question—whether China is replacing the United States as global hegemon—but reached starkly different conclusions. Jon Czin sees a tactical détente with both sides stringing each other along through the midterms, while Claire Berlinski sees an irreversible hegemonic transition as allies defect to China. [Semafor](https://semafor.com/s/BNHjzBKQFm?email=wschenk@gmail.com) provided the business-focused middle ground, reporting that commercial ties are warming ahead of Trump's April China visit.

**Economic Anxiety Everywhere:** [Bloomberg](https://links.message.bloomberg.com/s/c/dG4wBrZSoFrVGuRBYw3-rzooRHocdZ-zias6DCzmip23A3KsnhzFeJLQj367SoyN8_QGkLGKtkdHS8cSMvF2IRh60FF5rjcRcLqJBCx5CA6T2bnUkB4llONTynBLfPkYADiGHrzTuYnogYXQ3fQRGfa4xhD8lnCFTAyKSmZa0rppWgA16mUBY0alboCkdI98XrNY4mkU5pRSnO_32EXyjWF2ruWBkPa2a6B5U3-AsEQvofd7iDFt_nx6w_jCU0PK2H3aWvE76shvIED6O_5klZ9zWcX7MKnR7Um9vuAKnLXh-wnX_zB47ENVcB6zKPH9DeEhPe3_uIeDZf3JCMEul23ADxAVhnb8cScS6xpSPUZ2QujHE5-7spqTJQ/ych4yLrgJdTMDRzXJQhgecQD7ONdxyGF/17) and [Semafor](https://semafor.com/s/h7D8j3fqxl?email=wschenk@gmail.com) both led with the sharp drop in consumer confidence, connecting it to Trump's foreign policy volatility and economic uncertainty. This aligned with [ChinaTalk's](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/party-time-jon-czin-on-us-china-2025) discussion of how Trump's economic agenda has been repeatedly sidetracked by foreign policy distractions. The dollar's decline, consumer pessimism, and dollar trader bearish bets all pointed to mounting economic anxieties.

**Institutional Decay Across Sectors:** Multiple newsletters documented different aspects of institutional decline. [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-sad-and-self-inflicted-decline) analyzed The Washington Post's collapse in influence (from parity with NYT to 5% "mindshare"), [Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/r/b0aba520?m=33b1996b-f427-4fb3-88a9-83a2095d7637) covered the hollowing out of federal land management agencies through budget cuts, and [The Chronicle](https://links2.newsletter.chronicle.com/s/c/D8g5LEOL_-6mPRVhyOnBf5s2vEOP-ggqv1EFqnsUgwZrR3gouq6Y37bHIs3cx20W-KoFBEYJisnbD59I0bKHAxJAEqXhZtcdbqNwAVTcEReGpgYPpkKIKLW1HG0yTYFn7kZsE4K0RfrA9rUhhHz0Vbq_mbzbioFX8G_94wOO2QvE-1I-cC4zF_2xa2cjMVdKb9JWY2AtHo1J3jmjs9dvd60xrUqMgqQe-4Z_hb5XtJTx5yyrCnOReZx07ecAFpWlI2wM-YjQoRdlM5KbAEQKBjKrGyXNaL6L94uFWUliEOLziQD902V26bdgnwlTg8Dga8rGrTjkMbL16lRtLgQE26h50WTxHWzycZF8fFiXxYuMlmqW3myQXIuZuV1c0bjmbh7-v-5B6v_2evMFYJC_SKRIBzNjgV6mYB474Vf9m6WUxj65yltC/oLfdw-DGsrZWodDSuj_ofK7lBfNJXd1q/17) documented funding cuts and political battles in higher education. Each sector showed similar patterns: abrupt changes in direction, loss of public trust, and leaders making decisions that alienated their core constituencies.

**The Limits of Republican Loyalty:** The Minneapolis shootings revealed that there are limits to Republican willingness to support Trump's most extreme policies. [The Atlantic Daily](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2026/01/27/how-republicans-forced-trump-to-shift-course-in-minnesota) emphasized how unusual it was for so many GOP lawmakers to speak up, with even the NRA criticizing administration officials. This suggested that video evidence of U.S. citizens being killed by federal agents crossed a threshold that abstract policy debates did not.
