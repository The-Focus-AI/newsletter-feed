## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. The Problem of the Self and Ego

**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/do-i-matter), [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/why-you-should-let-it-go)

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/do-i-matter) devoted significant attention to the modern epidemic of self-obsession, drawing sharp contrasts with ancient philosophical approaches. The newsletter cites peer-reviewed studies showing a "measurable rise in first-person singular pronouns" in popular music alongside a decline in collective language.

The ancient philosophers, by contrast, viewed excessive ego as dangerous rather than authentic:

> "Socrates, for example, famously said 'know thyself,' but he didn't mean self-expression or self-esteem. He meant examining your desires, motives, and ignorance so you don't become ruled by them. The unexamined self was dangerous...not special." — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/do-i-matter)

The newsletter extends this analysis to Eastern philosophy, noting that Buddhism's doctrine of anatta (non-self) represents an even more radical critique of ego-attachment as the root of suffering.

In a complementary piece, [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/why-you-should-let-it-go) explored the myth of Electra as a cautionary tale about the cost of holding onto grievance:

> "Electra is a woman who cannot let go. And to many, it appears justifiable... She doesn't just want justice...she wants it loudly, publicly, and at any cost. And while she breaks every rule about how a woman 'should' behave in the ancient world... she also risks losing the very thing she's fighting for: her humanity." — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/why-you-should-let-it-go)

### 2. Religious Conversion and Spiritual Identity

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts)

[Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts) offered an extensive meditation on why young Protestant elites in America are converting to Catholicism, while reflecting on his own journey through Catholicism to Eastern Orthodoxy. The piece engages with research from WORLD magazine showing that while Protestantism dominates overall conversion statistics, Catholicism attracts converts from "aspiring power elites."

Dreher warns against purely intellectual conversion:

> "If your conversion (to Catholicism, Orthodoxy, or Protestantism) is only intellectual, or even mostly intellectual, you are on shakier ground than you realize." — [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts)

He draws an illuminating distinction between Western and Eastern Christian epistemology, noting that French and German have two words for "to know" (savoir/wissen for intellectual knowledge versus connaitre/kennen for personal knowledge), while Orthodoxy emphasizes the latter:

> "Orthodoxy is more about the personal sense of knowing than the abstract sense. It's more right-brained than left-brained." — [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts)

The piece concludes with a call for humility: "The worst kind of Christians are those who are snide and triumphalistic about their faith."

### 3. Western Civilization and Cultural Decline

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe), [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/pluribus-the-power-of-division)

[Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe) lamented America's growing indifference toward Europe, framing it through both geopolitical and personal lenses. He discusses Jean Raspail's controversial 1973 novel The Camp of the Saints, noting the review's observation about "Christianity reduced to boundless empathy" leading to disaster.

Dreher quotes a Catholic Herald reviewer on the novel's central critique:

> "For believers grappling with the influx of millions into the European first world, often contributing little to the common good of host societies, Raspail's work illuminates how a Christianity reduced to boundless empathy can lead to disaster and spiritual betrayal." — [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe)

Despite the pessimism, Dreher finds hope in young European Catholics, particularly the 20,000 pilgrims to Chartres, quoting a French friend: "That generation is going to save us."

### 4. Apocalypse, Alienation, and the Hive Mind

**Coverage:** [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/pluribus-the-power-of-division)

[Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/pluribus-the-power-of-division) surveyed five novels about global catastrophe (Ballard's The Drowned World, Liu Cixin's The Three-Body Problem, Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go, Harpman's I Who Have Never Known Men, and Mandel's Station Eleven) before analyzing the 2025 TV series Pluribus.

The piece connects contemporary loneliness to the appeal of apocalyptic fiction, citing a viral Chinese app called "Are You Dead" that requires daily check-ins from people living alone:

> "This virality speaks to a larger trend not only in China but in different forms across our entire world: a rise in people living alone, often feeling isolated or struggling with their well-being." — [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/pluribus-the-power-of-division)

Zizek reads Pluribus through Lacanian psychoanalysis, noting that the protagonist Carol "is asking herself not the usual hysterical question 'Am I a woman or a man?' but a more basic question: 'Am I dead or alive?'" The show depicts what Zizek calls being "caught between the two deaths: while biologically alive she is dead at the socio-symbolic level."

### 5. Homer, Identity, and the Oral Tradition

**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/odysseus-real-identity), [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/video-sea-of-homer-with-emily-wilson)

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/odysseus-real-identity) presented a provocative reinterpretation of the Odyssey, arguing that the man who returns to Ithaca and slays the suitors was not actually Odysseus but rather Philoctetes, the expert Achaean archer, hired by Telemachus as a mercenary.

The piece marshals textual evidence: Odysseus never uses the bow in the Iliad, the returned "Odysseus" walks with a limp (like Philoctetes, who was bitten by a snake), and even his own family fails to recognize him:

> "Homer has left a host of similar messages throughout the poem that guide us through the actual course of the action... The Odyssey is not a fairy tale for overgrown children, but an intricate maze filled with ingenious references that will inevitably escape those who do not study it closely." — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/odysseus-real-identity)

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/video-sea-of-homer-with-emily-wilson) reported on a live conversation with translator Emily Wilson, covering "the mysteries of Homer's identity, the power and complexity of the oral tradition, and the delicate (sometimes maddening) task of translating ancient poetry for modern readers."

### 6. Theology, Judaism, and Supersessionism

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/sunday-in-budapest)

[Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/sunday-in-budapest) engaged with Anglican theologian Gerald McDermott's critique of supersessionism (the view that Christianity abrogated God's covenant with the Jewish people). McDermott distinguishes "New Christian Zionism" from dispensationalism, arguing that "God has not ended his eternal covenant with the Jewish people and that the land promise is integral to that covenant."

The piece quotes McDermott on the complex question of Jews who could not accept Christ due to Christian persecution:

> "If God had mercy on Paul because of his ignorance, might God not have mercy on Jews who are ignorant of Jesus because of 'Christian' hatred for them in the name of a proclaimed 'Christ'?" — [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/sunday-in-budapest)

### 7. Spiritual Warfare and the Dangers of Occult Practice

**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/sunday-in-budapest)

[Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/sunday-in-budapest) recounted a case from The Exorcist Files podcast about a young Catholic woman who became possessed after a tarot reading in New Orleans. The piece emphasizes that mere belief is insufficient for spiritual protection:

> "What makes a Christian a Christian is not belief in Christ. If that was all it took, then the Devil, who knows the truth perfectly, would be the greatest Christian. What makes a Christian a Christian is his obedience to Christ." — [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/sunday-in-budapest)

Dreher connects this to Aldous Huxley's confession that his youthful atheism was motivated by sexual liberation: "The philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation from a certain system of morality."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Identity as Central Concern:** All three newsletters grappled with questions of identity this week. [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/do-i-matter) examined individual ego, [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts) explored religious identity through conversion, and [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/pluribus-the-power-of-division) analyzed the dissolution of individual identity into collective consciousness.

**Critique of Modern Individualism:** Both [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/do-i-matter) and [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe) criticized excessive self-focus, though from different angles. Classical Wisdom approached it through ancient philosophy and social media critique, while Dreher framed it as a spiritual and civilizational crisis.

**Tension Between Reason and Experience:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts) emphasized that purely intellectual faith is "shakier" than embodied, experiential faith, echoing [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/do-i-matter)'s discussion of how the Stoics and Buddhists valued practice over theory.

**Apocalyptic Undertones:** Both [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/pluribus-the-power-of-division) and [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe) engaged with themes of civilizational collapse, though Zizek approached it through fiction while Dreher addressed contemporary European decline.

## Surprising Perspectives

- **Odysseus as imposter:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/odysseus-real-identity)'s theory that Philoctetes impersonated Odysseus offers a genuinely novel reading of Homer that reframes the entire epic around themes of deception and identity.

- **Converts as gifts and burdens:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts)'s nuanced view that religious converts can both illuminate forgotten treasures and annoy cradle believers with their enthusiasm represents honest self-reflection.

- **Apocalypse as liberation:** [Slavoj Zizek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/pluribus-the-power-of-division)'s observation that Ballard's characters experience civilizational collapse as an "opportunity to pursue new modes of perception" inverts typical apocalyptic narratives.
