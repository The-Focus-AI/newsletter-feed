## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. The Psychology of Anger and Letting Go
**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/why-you-should-let-it-go)

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/why-you-should-let-it-go) opened the week with a meditation on the destructive power of sustained anger through the figure of Electra, the mythological character who has her own "complex" named after her by Carl Jung. The newsletter examined how Electra's justified rage over her father Agamemnon's murder becomes all-consuming, raising the question: "At what point do we need to just... let it go?"

> "Electra is a woman who cannot let go. And to many, it appears justifiable. Her father has been murdered, her mother is the murderer, and so revenge becomes her full-time job... But she also risks losing the very thing she's fighting for: her humanity." — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/why-you-should-let-it-go)

The piece positioned Electra as a timely warning for an age when "anger is all the rage," challenging readers to consider the personal cost of perpetual fury, even when the cause seems righteous.

### 2. Religious Conversion: Intellectual Pride vs. Lived Faith
**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts)

In a deeply personal essay, [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts) analyzed the wave of young Protestant converts to Catholicism in American power centers, particularly Washington D.C. He noted that while overall conversion numbers favor Protestantism (Catholicism loses 8.4 members for each new convert versus Protestantism's 1.8), elite converts are moving toward Catholicism and, to a lesser extent, Orthodoxy.

Drawing on an article from WORLD magazine, Dreher explored why ambitious young professionals are drawn to Catholicism's intellectual depth and systematic theology. But he offered a cautionary tale from his own experience:

> "Coming into Catholicism with the idealistic eyes of an intellectual convert set me up for a fall. I expected most of the priests I encountered to be some version of Father Neuhaus, and most of the bishops to be a lesser version of Pope John Paul II. That could not have been further from the truth." — [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts)

Dreher warned against treating conversion as a purely intellectual exercise or a vehicle for social advancement, emphasizing that "what makes a Christian a Christian is not belief in Christ... What makes a Christian a Christian is his obedience to Christ."

The essay also highlighted the distinction between intellectual knowledge (French "savoir," German "wissen") and personal, experiential knowledge (French "connaître," German "kennen"), arguing that Orthodox spirituality emphasizes the latter—knowing God personally rather than merely knowing facts about God.

### 3. Homer Reconsidered: Identity and Deception
**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/odysseus-real-identity)

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/odysseus-real-identity) presented a provocative reinterpretation of the Odyssey by Alberto Majrani, suggesting that the man who returned to Ithaca and slaughtered the suitors was not actually Odysseus but Philoctetes, the archer of the Trojan War, hired by Telemachus to impersonate his father.

The theory hinges on several clues: the mysterious stranger's lameness (matching Philoctetes' snake bite), his extraordinary archery skills (Odysseus never uses a bow in the Iliad), and the suspicious timing of returns. Most intriguingly, the article noted how "Odysseus" himself admits in the poem that only Philoctetes surpasses him in archery—a potential "message in a bottle" from Homer.

> "Homer has left a host of similar messages throughout the poem that guide us through the actual course of the action... The Odyssey is not a fairy tale for overgrown children, but an intricate maze filled with ingenious references that will inevitably escape those who do not study it closely." — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/odysseus-real-identity)

While presented as speculative interpretation, the piece invited readers to question assumptions about identity, authenticity, and deception—themes deeply woven throughout the Odyssey itself.

### 4. Post-Apocalyptic Narratives and Modern Isolation
**Coverage:** [Slavoj Žižek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/pluribus-the-power-of-division)

[Slavoj Žižek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/pluribus-the-power-of-division) surveyed five post-apocalyptic novels before analyzing the new TV series *Pluribus*, which depicts humanity transformed into a peaceful hive mind—except for 13 immune individuals who resist assimilation.

Žižek positioned the series against the backdrop of China's viral "Are You Dead" app, which requires daily check-ins to prevent emergency contact notifications, highlighting "widespread loneliness and youth disaffection" as the cultural context for stories about connection and isolation.

In *Pluribus*, protagonist Carol Sturka represents the existential problem of the isolated individual:

> "She is asking herself not the usual hysterical question 'Am I a woman or a man?' but a more basic question: 'Am I dead or alive?' She is correct in doing this: without individual others, confronted only with impersonal Them, I am existentially dead." — [Slavoj Žižek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/pluribus-the-power-of-division)

The essay explored how the series inverts typical apocalypse narratives: instead of collapse leading to social antagonisms, an alien intelligence creates universal peace and happiness—which the protagonist experiences as a form of death.

### 5. Europe, America, and the Death of Western Civilization
**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe)

[Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe) reflected on America's growing indifference to Europe's fate, comparing it to "a grown son not caring what happens to his parent." He noted that sophisticated American legal elites he encountered "gave a flying fig about Europe, or anywhere outside of America."

The piece centered on Jean Raspail's controversial 1973 novel *The Camp of the Saints*, which depicts Europe overwhelmed by migration. Dreher highlighted how the novel—despite its problematic racial depictions—presciently diagnosed European civilizational exhaustion:

> "Raspail exposes the danger of a faith poorly understood. Catholicism has always taught that virtues are interdependent. Mercy tempers justice, but justice anchors mercy, which becomes lawless without it." — [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe), quoting reviewer Thomas Colsy

Dreher expressed grief over what he sees as the coming collapse of European culture, tempered only by witnessing 20,000 young Catholics on pilgrimage to Chartres: "If Europe is going to be saved, it will be through the faith, in action, of young people like that."

### 6. The Crisis of the Ego in Modern Culture
**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/do-i-matter)

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/do-i-matter) diagnosed contemporary culture's obsession with the self, marshaling empirical evidence from music lyrics, social media, and political discourse. Multiple peer-reviewed studies show a measurable rise in first-person singular pronouns ("I," "me," "my") in popular music alongside declining collective language ("we," "us," "our").

The newsletter contrasted this with ancient philosophy's suspicion of ego. Socrates' "know thyself" meant examining desires to avoid being ruled by them, not celebrating self-expression. Plato believed reason should rule over appetite. The Stoics argued that "obsessing over the self... is a fast path to misery" because most concerns about identity and status are outside our control.

Buddhism goes furthest, teaching *anattā* (non-self)—the insight that the "I" is merely "a temporary bundle of sensations, thoughts, and feelings...not a fixed, independent entity."

> "The Buddha taught that clinging to the ego, our identity, desires, stories about who we are, is the root of dukkha (suffering). The more tightly we grip the self, the more anxious, defensive, and dissatisfied we become." — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/do-i-matter)

The piece challenged readers to consider how much the ego should matter, leaving the question deliberately open.

### 7. Christian Zionism and Biblical Prophecy
**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/sunday-in-budapest)

In a Sunday reflection mixing spiritual memoir with theological exploration, [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/sunday-in-budapest) shared correspondence with Rev. Gerald McDermott, a scholar who argues for "new Christian Zionism"—distinct from dispensationalist End Times scenarios but affirming that God's covenant with the Jewish people remains ongoing and includes the land promise.

McDermott challenged Dreher's "supersessionist" assumptions (the belief that Christianity abrogated God's covenant with Jews), citing Matthew 23:2-3 where Jesus praises the teachings of scribes and Pharisees, and Romans 11:28-29 where Paul says Jewish brothers who rejected Jesus are still "beloved because of the fathers" with "gifts and calling" that "are irrevocable."

The discussion raised complex questions about whether the massive return of Jews to the land starting in the 18th century fulfills biblical prophecy (Acts 3:21's *apokatastasis*), and how Christians should understand their relationship to Jewish Israel.

Dreher framed his exploration modestly: "I'm learning about something I hadn't thought much about! I guess I've always had this intuition that anyone who hates the Jews as Jews also hates God, who chose them as His people."

### 8. The Ancient World's Living Relevance
**Coverage:** [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-ancient-world-is-not-dead)

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-ancient-world-is-not-dead) offered a manifesto for classical education, arguing against those who view the ancient world as "dead and buried." The piece insisted that classical wisdom remains urgently relevant:

> "History gives us perspective, showing the rise and fall of empires and the cycles of human ambition... Myth reveals who we are—our fears, desires, and dreams made visible... And philosophy invites us into the Great Conversation, asking the questions that matter most: How should we live? And how can we live a meaningful life?" — [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-ancient-world-is-not-dead)

The newsletter centered its case on *eudaimonia*—not "mere happiness or fleeting pleasures, but deep fulfillment, the art of living well." This promotional piece positioned classical wisdom as essential for human flourishing in the modern world.

### 9. Weimar America: Radicalization on Left and Right
**Coverage:** [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/were-losing-european-nationalist)

In his most urgent political analysis of the week, [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/were-losing-european-nationalist) reported from Slovakia on European conservatives' growing disillusionment with Trump's "crude and insulting" rhetoric around Greenland and NATO, then pivoted to diagnosing America's descent into what he calls "Weimar America."

Dreher announced a new book deal for *Warning to Weimar America*, arguing that while the U.S. hasn't suffered Weimar Germany's war losses or hyperinflation, "the psychosocial conditions in the US today are eerily parallel to what existed in the Weimar Republic."

He warned about radicalization on both sides: leftist mobs in Minneapolis confronting ICE enforcement with violence, and right-wing influencers within the Trump administration using fascist aesthetics and messaging. Citing historian David Betz's thesis about Western susceptibility to civil war, Dreher argued that "decent people on both the Left and the Right have a responsibility to be aware of what's happening in Weimar America, and choose to act accordingly."

> "The worst kind of Christians are those who are snide and triumphalistic about their faith... If you don't have love—of God and of your neighbor, even your neighbor of a rival tradition, or no tradition at all—you are doing it wrong." — [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/were-losing-european-nationalist)

The piece balanced critique of both parties: condemning Democratic "sanctuary city" defiance of immigration law and liberal media silence on anti-ICE mob violence, while also criticizing ICE's "fascist aesthetics" and the Trump administration's performative cruelty.

Dreher noted the special appeal of radicalism to young men who "have only known great instability" and "have likely experienced first-hand how much contempt the Left in power within institutions has for you." A Zoomer friend active in DC politics told him what Groypers want: "They don't want anything. They want to tear it all down."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Danger of Ideological Purity

A striking convergence emerged around the theme of how ideological rigidity—whether political, religious, or philosophical—becomes self-destructive. [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/why-you-should-let-it-go)'s Electra loses her humanity to justified rage. [Rod Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts)'s Catholic converts risk spiritual pride when faith becomes primarily intellectual. [Dreher's analysis](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe) of Raspail's novel shows how "Christianity reduced to boundless empathy" becomes suicidal, while [his Weimar essay](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/were-losing-european-nationalist) warns that left-wing revolutionary morality and right-wing radicalization both threaten democracy.

The common thread: ideals pursued with absolute conviction, divorced from practical wisdom or humility, lead to catastrophe. As the Catholic Herald reviewer noted in Dreher's piece, "virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone."

### Identity: Fixed or Fluid?

The week's readings circled questions of authentic identity from multiple angles. [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/odysseus-real-identity)'s Odysseus article playfully suggested the hero's identity might be a complete fabrication. [Žižek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/pluribus-the-power-of-division)'s protagonist in *Pluribus* asks "Am I dead or alive?" when confronted with a hive mind that dissolves individual identity. [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/do-i-matter)'s ego essay challenged modern culture's assumption that a strong, curated sense of self leads to happiness, citing Buddhist teaching that the self is merely "a temporary bundle of sensations."

Meanwhile, [Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts) warned against making religious identity primarily intellectual or socially performative rather than rooted in obedience and personal relationship with God. The tension: how much does individual identity matter, and what makes it authentic?

### Civilization in Crisis

Both [Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/le-divorce-america-leaves-europe) and [Žižek](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/pluribus-the-power-of-division) grappled with civilizational collapse, though from different perspectives. Žižek surveyed post-apocalyptic literature as mirror to contemporary anxieties about isolation and loss of community. Dreher mourned Europe's cultural exhaustion and warned about America's parallel descent into pre-totalitarian conditions.

[Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/the-ancient-world-is-not-dead)'s promotional piece insisted "the ancient world is NOT dead" and remains essential for finding *eudaimonia* (flourishing) in modern life. Yet the week's readings collectively suggested that the classical wisdom tradition—with its emphasis on virtue, community, and transcendent meaning—faces near-total eclipse by therapeutic individualism on one side and revolutionary ideology on the other.

### Knowledge: Intellectual vs. Experiential

[Dreher's essay](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/converts) on religious conversion made explicit a distinction implicit throughout the week's readings: the difference between intellectual knowledge and lived, experiential knowledge. French and German have separate verbs—*savoir*/*wissen* (intellectual) versus *connaître*/*kennen* (personal)—that English collapses into one word: "know."

This distinction illuminated other pieces. [Classical Wisdom](https://classicalwisdom.substack.com/p/do-i-matter)'s critique of social media culture highlighted how curating knowledge about oneself differs from genuine self-knowledge in the Socratic sense. [Žižek's protagonist](https://slavoj.substack.com/p/pluribus-the-power-of-division) in *Pluribus* experiences the hive mind offering perfect happiness through shared consciousness, yet she recognizes this as existential death because it eliminates the possibility of personal, relational knowing.

[Dreher](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/sunday-in-budapest) quoted Charles Foster: converts can "see things within their new tradition with fresh eyes, and can illuminate treasures that old eyes have forgotten how to see, and to love." The danger comes when conversion remains purely intellectual rather than transforming one's entire mode of being.

### Prayer, Spiritual Practice, and Resistance

[Dreher's Sunday essay](https://roddreher.substack.com/p/sunday-in-budapest) wove together multiple strands: gratitude for answered prayer, the Russian Orthodox Akathist "Glory To God For All Things" (written by a priest dying in the Soviet gulag), warnings about tarot cards and occultism from *The Exorcist Files* podcast, and the reminder that "seemingly trivial decisions" about prayer discipline "could have very serious consequences for our souls."

The connection to political themes became explicit when Dreher quoted Father Carlos Martins distinguishing mere belief from obedience: "What makes a Christian a Christian is not belief in Christ... What makes a Christian a Christian is his obedience to Christ." This paralleled Dreher's political analysis, where he warned against both left-wing revolutionary morality and right-wing radicalism—both characterized by contempt for restraint and tradition.

Living faithfully under corrupt or hostile regimes requires spiritual practices that sustain integrity. The gulag priest's prayer of radical thanksgiving, Orthodox emphasis on experiential knowledge of God, and warnings about moral compromise in "harmless" areas all pointed toward spiritual resistance as foundation for any other kind.
