## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Major Winter Storm and Historic Snowfall
**Coverage:** [OpenSnow (Jan 26, AM)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42573), [OpenSnow (Jan 26, PM)](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-26/index.html), [OpenSnow (Jan 27)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42601)

The week opened with a major winter storm delivering widespread heavy snowfall across New England from Sunday into Monday. Dr. Jay Cordeira's Sunday night update, written at 11PM as snow fell "hard and fast," documented totals already exceeding a foot across southern New England with snow still ongoing.

> "Snow has been falling hard and fast across southern New England on Sunday with totals by ~11PM on Sunday well over a foot across a large swath of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts." — [OpenSnow (Jan 26)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42573)

**Final Storm Totals:** The highest reports reached 22.2 inches in Massachusetts, with widespread 18-19 inch totals in Ludlow and New Braintree, MA, and 18 inches in Eastford and Simsbury, CT. Mountain resorts saw exceptional accumulations: Wachusett led with 20 inches, followed by Waterville Valley at 18 inches, with Sunday River and Mohawk Mountain also posting 20-inch storm totals. Storm totals of 16-24 inches were common across the Berkshires and Worcester hills.

> "I expect storm totals to push toward 2 feet at several locations along I-90 in Massachusetts." — [OpenSnow (Jan 26)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42573)

**Post-Storm Conditions:** By Tuesday, Dr. Cordeira reported that "conditions are absolutely fantastic" with most resorts operating at or near 100% terrain. The Mt. Mansfield snow stake now reads 75 inches - already matching the average peak depth usually seen in late March - making this season's snowpack "firmly above average" and currently fourth all-time for late January.

### 2. Arctic Cold Pattern and Wind Chill Hazards
**Coverage:** [OpenSnow (Jan 26, PM)](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-26/index.html), [OpenSnow (Jan 27)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42601), [OpenSnow (Jan 28)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42614), [OpenSnow (Jan 30)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42658)

Following the storm, bitter arctic air settled into the East with valley highs near 10F and overnight lows below 0F through Saturday. Weekend conditions featured windchill temperatures below 0F across the entire region on both Saturday and Sunday.

> "Bitter arctic cold will settle into the East this week in the wake of a major winter storm this past weekend." — [OpenSnow (Jan 26)](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-26/index.html)

Friday's forecast warned skiers to "bring the extra layer" with windchill temperatures below 0F expected throughout the weekend. Despite the cold, snow conditions remained "absolutely fantastic" with groomers described as "great" and natural slopes "a bit mogul-ed" but otherwise skiing at or near 100%.

### 3. Missed Coastal Storm Opportunities
**Coverage:** [OpenSnow (Jan 27)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42601), [OpenSnow (Jan 28)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42614), [OpenSnow (Jan 30)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42658), [OpenSnow (Feb 1)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42684)

Throughout the week, Dr. Cordeira tracked multiple coastal storm threats that ultimately tracked too far offshore to benefit central and northern New England - a pattern of "unfortunate close shaves" that became a recurring theme.

**Sunday-Monday System (Feb 1-2):** The ECMWF model maintained hope for a potential coastal storm Sunday into Monday, but by Friday it became clear models had "finally caved toward a mostly out-to-sea solution." The storm was characterized as "a beauty" and responsible for "quasi-generational snows across portions of the Carolinas" but ultimately missed New England "wide right."

> "We are watching a beauty of a storm develop over the western North Atlantic and track off the Eastern Seaboard on Sunday. This storm was responsible for quasi-generational snows across portions of the Carolinas, but will unfortunately miss New England wide right." — [OpenSnow (Feb 1)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42684)

The ECMWF ensemble still suggested 50% probability of 3+ inches over Cape Cod, but probabilities dropped to under 20% elsewhere. Dr. Cordeira noted: "It really is a shame, because this storm will be a beast."

**Next Opportunity:** The forecast identified February 6-8 as the next potential snow window, with the ECMWF ensemble showing enhanced probabilities for 1-3 inches at most locations, possibly squeezing out an additional inch or two at higher elevations.

### 4. Comfort Food for Cold Weather
**Coverage:** [Warren General Store (Jan 29)](https://mailchi.mp/1d6af3d422b2/greetings-from-warren-general-5827318?e=09e14693dd)

With arctic temperatures gripping Connecticut, Warren General Store offered Chicken Tagine ($27.99 for 2) - dark meat chicken slowly braised with saffron, ginger, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, onions, garlic, preserved lemons, green olives, and fingerling potatoes, served with grain couscous. The gluten-free entree was paired with Austrian and Sicilian wine recommendations.

> "Saturday night's dinner is Warren General's Chicken Tagine... Taste the Magic of Morocco!" — [Warren General Store (Jan 29)](https://mailchi.mp/1d6af3d422b2/greetings-from-warren-general-5827318?e=09e14693dd)

Wine pairings included Grüner Veltliner "Gobelsburger" 2024 from Schloss Gobelsburg ($19.99) - one of Austria's most historic estates founded in 1171 - featuring "lemon zest, green apple, pear, and Grüner's signature white-pepper spice." The Sicilian option was Baroni di Pianogrillo Frappato 2022 ($29.99) from an organic estate with roots in the 1700s.

The newsletter also promoted Super Bowl party favorites with an order deadline of February 5th.

### 5. PBS Streaming and Membership
**Coverage:** [Connecticut Public (Jan 29)](https://secure.ctpublic.org/page/email/message/view?ea.campaigner.email=RicsAwc1aA3k7vl0gCOmuoNPjbcek5hH&broadcastId=498202&templateId=443649), Connecticut Public (Jan 31)

New releases on PBS Passport included Call the Midwife Season 14, Partners in Crime Season 2 (German crime drama with English subtitles), and Blanca Season 1 (Italian series featuring a blind audio analyst fighting for justice).

Connecticut Public also sent membership renewal reminders, with one newsletter noting "Your membership expires TODAY!" The appeal emphasized the foundation of listener support: "Your support is the foundation upon which every story, conversation, and program rests."

### 6. Website Analytics Performance
**Coverage:** Plausible Analytics (Feb 1)

January 2026 analytics for willschenk.com showed strong growth:
- Unique visitors: 1.2k (+24% vs. previous month)
- Pageviews: 1.7k (+14%)
- Bounce rate: 89% (+3%)

Top referrers were Google (451 visitors), DuckDuckGo (205), Bing (49), Yandex (25), and Kagi.com (13). The most visited page was `/howto/2025/claude_code_in_emacs/` with 281 visitors, followed by the homepage (193 visitors).

Note: This newsletter did not include a source_url in its frontmatter.

### 7. Regional Weather Patterns Beyond New England
**Coverage:** [OpenSnow (Jan 28)](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-28/index.html), [OpenSnow (Jan 30)](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-30/index.html)

While New England saw quiet conditions, the broader regional forecasts highlighted action elsewhere:

**British Columbia High Elevations:** A series of warm storms impacted the Northwest and Western Canada with rising snow levels, but higher-elevation BC resorts remained favored for accumulating snow.

**Southern Appalachians:** A cold weekend storm brought powder conditions to Appalachian ski resorts with low-density snow, while the rest of the East endured bitterly cold temperatures.

**Forecast Verification:** OpenSnow shared their January 21 5-day forecast verification, showing they under-forecasted actual snowfall by only 2% - a remarkable accuracy demonstration.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Art of Forecast Communication
[OpenSnow's](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42573) coverage throughout the week exemplifies expert weather communication. Dr. Cordeira balanced technical meteorological detail (ensemble model probabilities, snow-to-liquid ratios, ECMWF vs. GFS model comparisons) with accessible narrative storytelling. His transparency about uncertainty, personal travel schedule constraints, and even disappointment over missed storms creates authenticity rarely found in weather forecasting.

### Local Business Weather Responsiveness
The timing of [Warren General Store's](https://mailchi.mp/1d6af3d422b2/greetings-from-warren-general-5827318?e=09e14693dd) warm Moroccan tagine offering during the arctic cold snap demonstrates sophisticated hyperlocal marketing. Small businesses in weather-dependent regions monitor forecasts as closely as ski resorts, timing comfort food promotions to temperature drops.

### Membership Economics of Public Media
[Connecticut Public's](https://secure.ctpublic.org/page/email/message/view?ea.campaigner.email=RicsAwc1aA3k7vl0gCOmuoNPjbcek5hH&broadcastId=498202&templateId=443649) dual approach - offering premium streaming content while also sending urgent renewal reminders - illustrates the ongoing challenge of the public media funding model. The appeal emphasized foundational support while the benefit highlighted exclusive early streaming access to popular British dramas.

## Surprising or Contrarian Elements

**Fourth Best January Snowpack, Yet "Quiet Week":** Despite Mt. Mansfield's snow stake reading 75 inches (fourth all-time for late January and already at "average" late-March peak depth), the meteorologist characterized the week ahead as "fairly quiet" and "relatively quiet conditions into mid-February." This recalibration of expectations shows how exceptional seasons reset what counts as active.

**"Quasi-Generational" Coastal Storm Miss:** The characterization of the February 1 coastal storm as producing "quasi-generational snows across portions of the Carolinas" while New England got nothing highlights the razor-thin margin between major events and complete misses in coastal meteorology. The forecast track shifted perhaps 100-150 miles offshore, transforming a potential blockbuster into a "wide right" miss.

**Mt. Mansfield Snow Stake as Seasonal Benchmark:** The detailed tracking of Mt. Mansfield's snow stake depth (75 inches) and its comparison to historical norms provides a fascinating multi-decade perspective. The observation that it's "fourth all-time for late January" but could still climb toward 100 inches by late March/early April if trends continue demonstrates the value of long-term observational datasets.

**Technical Forecast Accuracy:** The forecast verification showing OpenSnow under-forecasted by only 2% across multiple resorts over 5 days is remarkable, especially given the complexity of mountain snow forecasting with terrain effects, elevation-dependent precipitation, and highly variable snow ratios.
