The week featured New England's most significant winter weather event of the season, combining dangerously cold temperatures with a major snowstorm. Dr. Jay Cordeira's forecasting tracked the storm from development through aftermath with impressive precision.

**Extreme Cold:** Saturday January 24th brought the coldest temperatures of the season, with Mt. Washington recording -30F with windchill of -80F at 4:15AM. Multiple ski resorts implemented "cold holds" and limited operations.

> "It's currently 4:15AM, -30F on top of Mt. Washington, with a windchill of -80F. You read that right." - [OpenSnow (Jan 24)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42545?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

**The Storm:** Sunday into Monday delivered 12-20 inches across southern New England, with peak reports of 18-19 inches in Ludlow and New Braintree, Massachusetts, and 18 inches in Eastford and Simsbury, Connecticut. The [final storm recap on Tuesday, January 27](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42601?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026) confirmed the highest official report at 22.2 inches in Massachusetts, with ski resorts posting impressive totals: Wachusett led with 20 inches, Waterville Valley at 18 inches, with Sunday River and Mohawk Mountain also reaching 20-inch storm totals.

> "That snowband is going to produce snowfall rates of 3-4 inches per hour on Sunday afternoon/evening." - [OpenSnow (Jan 23)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42517?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

> "I know it's cold, but conditions are absolutely fantastic; most resorts are now open at or near 100%." - [OpenSnow (Jan 27)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42601?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

**Technical Insight:** The forecasts highlighted the role of the Air Force 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron ("Hurricane Hunters") flying the cutoff low west of California and dropping dropsondes to improve model accuracy - a detail that Dr. Cordeira noted he helps plan as part of his day job.

### 2. Ski Resort Operations and Conditions
**Coverage:** [OpenSnow Regional (Jan 21)](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-21/index.html), [OpenSnow Regional (Jan 23)](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-23/index.html), [OpenSnow Regional (Jan 26)](https://lift.opensnow.com/newsletters/east/2026-01-26/index.html)

The extreme cold forced operational adjustments across New England ski areas. Jay Peak postponed planned activities, and the NWS issued an "extreme cold watch" for much of northern New England. The forecast identified the "jackpot" zones: Berkshires, southern Greens, and areas favoring 18+ inch totals.

> "High temperatures will not get above 0F on Saturday and the windchill will be below -20F. Many resorts will take action with limited operations to limit cold exposure." - [OpenSnow (Jan 22)](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42496?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026)

The storm was characterized as a "fluff bomb" due to high snow-to-liquid ratios (15:1 to 20:1), meaning the snow was exceptionally light and fluffy - ideal for skiing but requiring adjustment of raw precipitation forecasts.

### 3. Cold Weather Comfort Food
**Coverage:** [Warren General Store](https://mailchi.mp/8802d59fed52/greetings-from-warren-general-5827201?e=09e14693dd)

They also offered a non-alcoholic option, Shania Verdejo 0.0% ($18.99), for "Damp or Dry January."

> "This is a hearty and savory stew of seared beef and fork-tender vegetables simmered in a rich full-flavored red wine sauce." - [Warren General Store](https://mailchi.mp/8802d59fed52/greetings-from-warren-general-5827201?e=09e14693dd)

New seafood arrivals included Stone Crab and Snapper for the weekend.

### 4. PBS Streaming Content

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### Weather Driving Lifestyle Content
The timing of the [Warren General Store](https://mailchi.mp/8802d59fed52/greetings-from-warren-general-5827201?e=09e14693dd) "Cold Weather Cuisine" email arriving just as [OpenSnow](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42496?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026) was predicting historic cold demonstrates how local businesses align their marketing with weather events. Both newsletters served readers in the Connecticut/New England region with complementary content: one telling you what to expect outdoors, the other providing comfort indoors.

### Expert Forecasting as Compelling Narrative
[OpenSnow's](https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/newengland/post/42573?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_term=dailysnowalert&utm_campaign=2025-2026) daily updates functioned almost as serialized storytelling - building anticipation from the initial forecast through model refinement, the extreme cold setup, and finally the storm's delivery. Dr. Cordeira's transparency about uncertainty ("failure modes still exist for low-end verification, but I remain optimistic") and personal notes (heading to Texas for a meteorology conference, missing the storm locally) add authenticity rarely found in weather coverage.

### Regional Focus
All newsletters this week served hyperlocal audiences - New England weather, a Connecticut general store, Connecticut Public Television, and analytics for a personal website. This stands in contrast to the broader tech or political newsletters, emphasizing that the "personal" category captures geographically-specific and individually-relevant content.

## Surprising or Contrarian Elements

**Hurricane Hunters for Winter Weather:** The revelation that the Air Force's Hurricane Hunters were flying reconnaissance missions over the Pacific for a winter storm, dropping dropsondes to improve forecast models, highlights the sophisticated infrastructure behind modern weather prediction.

**-80F Windchill:** The Mt. Washington Observatory reading of -80F windchill is almost incomprehensible - at these temperatures, exposed skin can get frostbite in under 5 minutes.

**Forecast Accuracy:** The forecasts held remarkably well, with predictions of 12-18+ inches verifying at 12-20 inches in the targeted areas, demonstrating advances in mesoscale meteorology and ensemble modeling techniques like PEAKS AI.
