## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. AI and State Power
**Coverage:** [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/what-trump-really-wants-with-ai), [Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/management-as-ai-superpower), [Core Memory](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29yZW1lbW9yeS5jb20vcC9oZS1sZWZ0LW9wZW5haS1qZXJyeS10d29yZWs_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RVeU5UUTRNakFzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RrNU56RXpNQ3dpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TlRnNU1UTXdMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpJd09UazJJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS53Sktfc2NjNnA5TnhNUzhtZ2VUcHhkaGt2S3NTRUg4d3hHam5VYmdsSXM0IiwicCI6MTg1MjU0ODIwLCJzIjozMjA5OTYsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg5OTcxMzAsImV4cCI6MjA4NDU3MzEzMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.5uq0KvcmTUR8uA6n9yVeSJtdPdBVVFyRiu371smSEOQ?)

[Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/what-trump-really-wants-with-ai) reframed Trump's AI strategy not as deregulation but as deliberate state power consolidation. Drawing on policy papers by Alondra Nelson and Brian J. Chen, Merchant argues Trump is "concentrating governmental power at the federal level while deploying it through mechanisms—investment, ownership, research funding, immigration controls, and preemption—not typically classified as 'regulation.'"

> "Trump is not removing government from AI regulation; it is concentrating governmental power at the federal level while deploying it through mechanisms—investment, ownership, research funding, immigration controls, and preemption—not typically classified as 'regulation.'" — [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/what-trump-really-wants-with-ai)

The administration has taken equity stakes in Intel ($9 billion for 10%) and eight other companies, restricted H-1B visas, and issued executive orders opening federal lands to data centers with environmental review exemptions. Merchant suggests "semi-nationalized OpenAI is entirely thinkable" given current federal entanglement.

[Core Memory](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29yZW1lbW9yeS5jb20vcC9oZS1sZWZ0LW9wZW5haS1qZXJyeS10d29yZWs_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RVeU5UUTRNakFzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RrNU56RXpNQ3dpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TlRnNU1UTXdMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpJd09UazJJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS53Sktfc2NjNnA5TnhNUzhtZ2VUcHhkaGt2S3NTRUg4d3hHam5VYmdsSXM0IiwicCI6MTg1MjU0ODIwLCJzIjozMjA5OTYsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg5OTcxMzAsImV4cCI6MjA4NDU3MzEzMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.5uq0KvcmTUR8uA6n9yVeSJtdPdBVVFyRiu371smSEOQ?) offered a contrasting AI narrative through Jerry Tworek's OpenAI departure. Tworek, who worked on reasoning technology including o1, described the company as increasingly "conservative" and suggested "the large AI companies have become conservative as a whole and that there might be bigger, better ideas to be found elsewhere."

[Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/management-as-ai-superpower) provided practical counterpoint, arguing "management as AI superpower" is emerging as the key skillset. His MBA students created working startup prototypes in four days—work that would have taken "an order of magnitude" longer pre-AI. The insight: "the key to success was actually... telling the AI what you want."

### 2. The Bureaucratic Machine
**Coverage:** [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/the-status-quo-machine-hidden-system-turns-operators-into-culture-problems), [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/are-good-clothes-boring)

[The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/the-status-quo-machine-hidden-system-turns-operators-into-culture-problems) published a blistering satirical memo "The Status Quo Machine," written as instructions to "Guardians of Decay" on maintaining corporate control through performative values, consultant validation, and complexity theater:

> "Networks are only for speeches. Power lives in the corporate ladder... In public, talk like you've just discovered networks... In practice, do everything you can to preserve the hierarchy." — [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/the-status-quo-machine-hidden-system-turns-operators-into-culture-problems)

[Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/are-good-clothes-boring) applied similar analysis to fashion's "Slow Clothes" movement, examining the paradox that "anti-fashion labels, while remaining small, have now become inarguably fashionable: The 'anti-trend' ethos is, for the time being, extremely on trend." The piece grapples with whether genuine resistance can exist or whether market forces inevitably co-opt authenticity.

### 3. Canada's Assisted Suicide Crisis
**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/a88c2fc6-ed03-46aa-9ae0-eaffd0a55088?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

[The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/a88c2fc6-ed03-46aa-9ae0-eaffd0a55088?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) published Yuan Yi Zhu's devastating "Determined to Die" investigation about 26-year-old Kiano Vafaeian, killed through Canada's MAID program despite not being terminally ill. Canada now has 5.1% of all deaths (16,499 in 2024) through assisted suicide. The fastest-growing category isn't cancer or specific illness but "other"—nearly doubling to 4,255 deaths in 2023, representing 28% of all assisted suicides.

> "MAID opens the door to young people who are struggling. Where normally the healthcare system would have insisted there is hope, some physicians now say: If that's how you feel, I'm here to help you end your life." — Trudo Lemmens, quoted in [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/a88c2fc6-ed03-46aa-9ae0-eaffd0a55088?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

Dr. Ellen Wiebe, who has performed over 500 assisted deaths, describes it as "the best work I've ever done" and told Zhu: "Just because it's worth living for somebody who is blind doesn't mean life is worth living for someone else who is blind."

### 4. Deep Reading and Philosophical Time
**Coverage:** [Jeremy D Johnson](https://jeremydjohnson.substack.com/p/reclaiming-time-for-deep-reading), [Molly Young](https://mollyyoung.substack.com/p/so-you-think-you-can-read-x), [Steven Johnson](https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/the-wetlands-interregnum)

[Jeremy D Johnson](https://jeremydjohnson.substack.com/p/reclaiming-time-for-deep-reading) made an impassioned case for "reclaiming time for deep reading" through Jean Gebser's philosophical masterwork, arguing that meaning-making requires "a special, paradoxical kind of time—at once deliberate and unintentional":

> "These times call for us to turn towards meaning, not mechanism. We need to make the choice to reclaim time from relentless algorithmic capture." — [Jeremy D Johnson](https://jeremydjohnson.substack.com/p/reclaiming-time-for-deep-reading)

He points to a "quiet renaissance" in para-academic reading communities where "voluntary seriousness" replaces credential-seeking. Gebser's work on integral consciousness offers tools for "inhabiting the tensions of the ecological 'middle'" between catastrophe and metamorphosis.

[Molly Young](https://mollyyoung.substack.com/p/so-you-think-you-can-read-x) echoed this through book recommendations, praising Iris Murdoch and Akimitsu Takagi. [Steven Johnson](https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/the-wetlands-interregnum) explored how declassified CIA Corona satellite imagery revolutionized understanding of ancient Mesopotamia's wetlands ecology.

### 5. Technical Innovation and Philosophy
**Coverage:** [Contraptions](https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/robot-auras), [Scott Werner](https://worksonmymachine.ai/p/what-if-we-took-message-passing-seriously), [Core Memory](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29yZW1lbW9yeS5jb20vcC90aGUtYWJ5c3Mtb3BlbnMtZm9yLWJ1c2luZXNzLWltcG9zc2libGUtbWV0YWxzP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1lbWFpbC1wb3N0JnI9MWllZnkmdG9rZW49ZXlKMWMyVnlYMmxrSWpveU5UTTRNVFF5TENKd2IzTjBYMmxrSWpveE9EVTROVE14TnpVc0ltbGhkQ0k2TVRjMk9UUTBOREUzT0N3aVpYaHdJam94TnpjeU1ETTJNVGM0TENKcGMzTWlPaUp3ZFdJdE16SXdPVGsySWl3aWMzVmlJam9pY0c5emRDMXlaV0ZqZEdsdmJpSjkuWU55bTh3YjlBb0daVHotc3B5cjJTMGdKd2s4SEV1UnppWHF4VjVsdDlMdyIsInAiOjE4NTg1MzE3NSwicyI6MzIwOTk2LCJmIjpmYWxzZSwidSI6MjUzODE0MiwiaWF0IjoxNzY5NDQ0MTc4LCJleHAiOjIwODUwMjAxNzgsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0wIiwic3ViIjoibGluay1yZWRpcmVjdCJ9.JXw3k5ltN2qPLTQ_T-X_QpcgC3v0DJ6r-nfvYU2_6yg?)

[Venkatesh Rao](https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/robot-auras) proposed "robot auras"—visual affect displays inspired by Iain M. Banks's Culture novels—as alternatives to anthropomorphic design. Rather than cute googly eyes or realistic biomorphism, Rao suggests color-coded kinematic states communicating robot internal states "from first principles."

[Scott Werner](https://worksonmymachine.ai/p/what-if-we-took-message-passing-seriously) built `prompt_objects`, a Ruby gem treating AI agents as Smalltalk-inspired objects communicating via natural language message passing—"Kay's 'late binding' pushed to an extreme" where semantic binding happens entirely at runtime.

[Core Memory](https://substack.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.JXw3k5ltN2qPLTQ_T-X_QpcgC3v0DJ6r-nfvYU2_6yg?) investigated deep-sea mining's ethical complexities through Impossible Metals' crab-like autonomous vehicles designed to harvest polymetallic nodules with minimal sediment disruption.

### 6. Strategic Thinking and Decision-Making
**Coverage:** [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/stein-network-centric-warfare-trust-mission-command-ooda), [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/presence-that-works-in-real-life-acc), [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/john-boyd-99th-birthday-real-ooda-orientation-destruction-creation)

Multiple [Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/john-boyd-99th-birthday-real-ooda-orientation-destruction-creation) pieces celebrated John Boyd's 99th birthday, emphasizing that his OODA framework is fundamentally about "Orientation" not speed. Col. Frederick P. Stein discussed network-centric warfare as reorganizing around "shared awareness, clearer intent, and the courage to push decisions to the edge."

### 7. Political Turbulence and Institutional Breakdown

Sources describe him as "bull in a china shop" and "dictator" who allegedly used his position to get mortgage information on Trump's political enemies.

[Glenna Goldis](https://substack.com/redirect/9a50ae8e-2328-4a2b-bb7e-09fa302813bf?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) wrote about being fired by New York AG Letitia James for opposing pediatric gender medicine. Despite four years of work, she was terminated for "disruptive public speech" after repeatedly expressing concerns about chemical and surgical interventions for minors.

> "I chose progressive lawyering as my career because I wanted to fight for vulnerable people. It's ironic that my career on the left may be over because I did exactly that." — [Glenna Goldis](https://substack.com/redirect/9a50ae8e-2328-4a2b-bb7e-09fa302813bf?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### Institutional Decay vs. Human Agency

The dominant pattern was examining how institutions—government, corporate, medical—exert control undermining individual autonomy:

- [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/what-trump-really-wants-with-ai) and [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/9a50ae8e-2328-4a2b-bb7e-09fa302813bf?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) documented government overreach (AI policy, gender medicine)
- [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/the-status-quo-machine-hidden-system-turns-operators-into-culture-problems) and [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/are-good-clothes-boring) exposed bureaucratic and market co-optation
- [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/a88c2fc6-ed03-46aa-9ae0-eaffd0a55088?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) revealed how medical systems facilitate death over life

### The Return to Fundamentals

Multiple newsletters advocated first principles thinking:

- [Jeremy D Johnson](https://jeremydjohnson.substack.com/p/reclaiming-time-for-deep-reading) on deep reading as meaning-making
- [Scott Werner](https://worksonmymachine.ai/p/what-if-we-took-message-passing-seriously) on Smalltalk's message-passing for AI
- [Venkatesh Rao](https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/robot-auras) on robot affect displays from scratch
- [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/john-boyd-99th-birthday-real-ooda-orientation-destruction-creation) on Boyd's authentic OODA framework

### Technology as Double-Edged Sword

AI emerged as both liberating tool and instrument of control:

- [Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/management-as-ai-superpower): AI enables unprecedented productivity
- [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/what-trump-really-wants-with-ai): Federal government weaponizes AI for dominance

## Notable Quotes

> "The mirage of AI deregulation obscures this truth. Power has not retreated. It has moved—and democratic accountability requires following it there." — Alondra Nelson, quoted in [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/what-trump-really-wants-with-ai)

> "A culture that admits to having no time admits to having no meaning. No soul." — [Jeremy D Johnson](https://jeremydjohnson.substack.com/p/reclaiming-time-for-deep-reading)

> "Guardians of Decay do not need to win arguments. They need to make everyone else confused, isolated, and too tired to keep fighting." — [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/the-status-quo-machine-hidden-system-turns-operators-into-culture-problems)

> "The most potent meaning does in fact reside in their warp and in their weft, in the interior seams that no one else knows are there but you, in their palpable connection to the earth that grew them and to the hands that made them." — [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/are-good-clothes-boring)
