# Week 05 Misc Newsletter Analysis (Jan 27-Feb 2, 2026)

## Overview

Week 05's miscellaneous newsletters present a striking convergence between AI's transformation of work and deeply human themes of meaning, suffering, and creativity. [Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/management-as-ai-superpower) framed management skills as the new AI superpower, while [Olga](https://dataanalysis.substack.com/p/celebrating-300th-newsletter) celebrated 300 editions of hard-won newsletter wisdom. Against this backdrop of technological optimism, [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/44dbf5dc-05d0-47b8-be3b-460e0ca56ae9?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) covered political turmoil in Minneapolis and Iran's brutal crackdown on protests, while [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-seduction-of-suffering) explored why we cling to pain as identity. Fashion, gene editing, and strategic thinking rounded out a week that asked fundamental questions about what we value and who we're becoming.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. AI Transforms Work Through Management, Not Just Technology

**Coverage:** [Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/management-as-ai-superpower), [Scott Werner](https://worksonmymachine.ai/p/the-different-shapes-of-think-before), [Olga](https://dataanalysis.substack.com/p/celebrating-300th-newsletter)

The week's most compelling AI insight came not from model capabilities but from organizational dynamics. [Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/management-as-ai-superpower) documented an experimental MBA class where students built working startups in four days using AI tools—achieving results "an order of magnitude further along" than typical semester-long projects. His key insight: "The skills that are so often dismissed as 'soft' turned out to be the hard ones."

> "I wish I could say this impressive output was the result of my brilliant teaching, but we don't really have a great framework yet for how to use all these tools, the students largely figured it out on their own. It helped that they had some management and subject matter expertise because it turns out that the key to success was actually the last bit of the previous paragraph: telling the AI what you want." — [Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/management-as-ai-superpower)

Mollick introduced an equation for agentic work: whether to delegate to AI depends on three variables—Human Baseline Time (how long you'd take), Probability of Success (how likely AI will deliver), and AI Process Time (cost of requesting and evaluating). With GPT-5.2 tying or beating human experts 72% of the time in OpenAI's GDPval paper, the calculation increasingly favors AI delegation—but only when paired with clear instructions, effective feedback, and good evaluation skills.

[Scott Werner](https://worksonmymachine.ai/p/the-different-shapes-of-think-before) complemented this with a whimsical but substantive exploration of "think before you build" prompting techniques through the allegory of a beaver consulting an Oracle. He outlined five approaches: Deductive (articulate principles first), Inductive (show examples, trust pattern recognition), Abductive (extract explicit principles from examples), Contrapositive (define failure modes to avoid), and DSL Scaffolding (build a language for the problem domain).

> "The Oracle knows how to build. But it doesn't always know how it knows. When you ask it to build and figure out quality at the same time, things get confused." — [Scott Werner](https://worksonmymachine.ai/p/the-different-shapes-of-think-before)

Both perspectives converge on a crucial insight: AI delegation isn't about clever prompts but about translating domain expertise into clear specifications—essentially reinventing management for artificial teammates.

### 2. The Creator Economy's Hidden Costs

**Coverage:** [Olga](https://dataanalysis.substack.com/p/celebrating-300th-newsletter), [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/are-good-clothes-boring)

[Olga](https://dataanalysis.substack.com/p/celebrating-300th-newsletter) marked her 300th newsletter with brutal honesty about the realities of consistent creation. After five years of weekly publishing without missing a single issue, reaching 30K readers and 60K monthly views, she distilled ten hard-won lessons that challenge the "content creator" mythology.

> "Imagine writing on a deadline every week for 5 years without sick days, vacations, holidays, work deadlines, or anything else getting in the way. You have to really love what you do and truly believe in the mission you're on." — [Olga](https://dataanalysis.substack.com/p/celebrating-300th-newsletter)

Her most counterintuitive insights: "Quantity over quality doesn't work anymore" (with 45,000+ data writers on Substack, only high-value evergreen content sustains growth), newsletters build credibility but not instant leads (90% of her consulting came from referrals, not newsletter readers), and the audience changes predictably in waves (0-100 = inner circle, 100-1K = students, 1K-10K = builders, 10K+ = senior practitioners).

The operational burden surprised her: "90% of writing is research," and paid subscriptions bring "taxes, invoicing, refund requests, group subscriptions, and general support" that consume unexpected hours. Yet she advises going paid early: "After I went paid (and upgraded the content), open rates increased, the same posts received more reads, the newsletter was taken more seriously, and, most importantly, I took it more seriously."

### 3. Fashion's Authenticity Crisis: The "Slow Clothes" Paradox

**Coverage:** [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/are-good-clothes-boring), [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-lo-fi-mark-of-a-real-one)

[Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/are-good-clothes-boring) tackled fashion's existential contradiction: brands that rejected trend cycles and artificial scarcity have become inarguably trendy. In a sweeping 6,000+ word essay, they documented how "Slow Clothes"—small independent makers focused on craft, natural fabrics, and anti-fashion principles—reached critical mass and now face the corrupting forces of their own success.

> "The contradiction here, of course, is that these putatively anti-fashion labels, while remaining small, have now become inarguably fashionable: The 'anti-trend' ethos is, for the time being, extremely on trend." — [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/are-good-clothes-boring)

The piece opens with Minneapolis ICE nurse Alex Pretti's killing and memorial donations, then pivots to analyzing how lines like Auralee, Comoli, Evan Kinori, and Lemaire—once niche artisan projects—now dominate fashion discourse. They face two threats: supply-side carpetbaggers (Zara creating fake artisan stores, H&M pushing "H&M Atelier") and demand-side newcomers misunderstanding the appeal as IYKYK status signaling.

The essay's most provocative claim: good clothes have become seductive not as mere symbols but as "Things in Themselves." In 2026, "we have grown unprecedentedly tired and mistrustful of the World of Symbols and Signs. We want to engage, instead, with the World of Things in Themselves." The emphasis on natural dyes, visible construction, and "interior seams that no one else knows are there but you" offers an off-ramp from the anxiety of symbolic consumption—but only if practitioners resist collapsing into their own "earth-toned morass of marketing buzzwords."

### 4. Political Violence and Institutional Breakdown

**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/44dbf5dc-05d0-47b8-be3b-460e0ca56ae9?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/2c86172c-0a50-4190-9e12-451a9de4697e?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/9a50ae8e-2328-4a2b-bb7e-09fa302813bf?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/7901fc4a-41ab-4066-b397-85daab120ab1?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

[The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/44dbf5dc-05d0-47b8-be3b-460e0ca56ae9?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) documented the Trump administration's tactical retreat after border patrol killed ICE nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. After initial inflammatory rhetoric labeling Pretti a "domestic terrorist," the administration reversed course when criticism emerged even from traditional supporters. Border patrol chief Greg Bovino was demoted, border czar Tom Homan dispatched to Minneapolis, and Trump claimed "very good" conversations with Minnesota officials he'd recently accused of "inciting insurrection."

By Wednesday, [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/2c86172c-0a50-4190-9e12-451a9de4697e?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) reported Minneapolis protesters sensing victory: "They messed with the wrong city," realtor Mary Irene Slatt declared, while Kevyn Burger noted, "They will never say we won, but we know it." The incident's political fallout extended to Senator Fetterman asking Trump to fire DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, writing "Americans have died. She is betraying DHS's core mission."

Meanwhile, [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/7901fc4a-41ab-4066-b397-85daab120ab1?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) published a harrowing firsthand account from Iran's crushed protests. An anonymous source (called Ali) who fled Iran described regime forces using machine guns and shotguns to massacre protesters—many shot in the back while fleeing. The Human Rights Activists News Agency confirmed 6,126 deaths with 17,000+ under investigation.

> "This was not about keeping back crowds. This was about killing as many people as possible." — Ali, Iranian protester, via [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/7901fc4a-41ab-4066-b397-85daab120ab1?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

The regime's brutality extended beyond killing: families forced to pay thousands for bodies (the "bullet price"), corpses stolen from graves and paraded in garbage trucks before mass burial. One elderly woman at the protests responded to Ali's praise of her bravery: "We have only one life. Let them take mine. They have already taken everything else."

In another institutional breakdown story, [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/9a50ae8e-2328-4a2b-bb7e-09fa302813bf?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) published Glenna Goldis's account of being fired by New York Attorney General Letitia James for publicly opposing pediatric gender medicine. As a lesbian consumer fraud attorney, Goldis spent years researching what she viewed as deceptive medical practices, writing 60 blog essays, and speaking at the FTC—activities that led to interrogations, speech restrictions, and ultimately termination for "disruptive public speech."

### 5. The Psychology of Suffering as Identity

**Coverage:** [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-seduction-of-suffering)

[Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-seduction-of-suffering) delivered Week 05's most philosophically ambitious piece: a 5,000+ word meditation on why suffering becomes seductive when it confirms identities we're not ready to abandon. Using Catherine from Wuthering Heights as her anchor, she argued that we don't undergo suffering passively—we inhabit it, protect it, and organize expectations around it until it acquires "the status of an interpretive instrument rather than an experience."

> "Suffering becomes seductive when it offers identity without risk. When it allows you to remain someone without becoming someone new. When it spares you the terror of desire returning." — [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-seduction-of-suffering)

The essay's core thesis: pain explains us better than desire, which makes it dangerously comfortable. "I used to wake up already tired, the fatigue arriving in advance of the day itself, carried by the certainty of how it would unfold. Memory before tea. Longing before noon. Silence dressed up as depth." Healing threatens this structure because it's destabilizing—"Who are you without the wound?"

Tamara identified suffering's social functions: moral exemption ("People expect less of you"), aesthetic distinction (art rewards "the artist who bleeds onto the page"), and narrative coherence (explaining your hesitation, distance, and refusal to risk). The unfinished relationship becomes an "emotional reliquary" you revisit to preserve "a sort of ache that reassures you you are still alive."

> "Sometimes we don't want closure because closure would expose how much of the story was carried by us alone." — [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-seduction-of-suffering)

Her most unsettling observation: "Uncertainty is far more destabilising than grief. Grief at least has contours. It gives the day a tone. You wake up knowing how you will feel. There is grim relief in that." The piece ends without resolution, only "the unremarkable decision to let a story end even if it once explained everything."

### 6. Science, Strategy, and Systems Thinking

**Coverage:** [Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/the-present-and-future-of-gene-editing-jennifer-doudna-crispr), [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/the-status-quo-machine-hidden-system-turns-operators-into-culture-problems), [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/angus-fletcher-narrative-intelligence-ooda-commanders-intent-red-teaming-truth-psyop), [News Minimalist](https://newsletter.newsminimalist.com/p/india-and-eu-reach-a-free-trade-deal-representing-a-third-of-global-trade-11-more-stories)

[Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/the-present-and-future-of-gene-editing-jennifer-doudna-crispr) featured Nobel Prize winner Jennifer Doudna discussing CRISPR's present and future. While CRISPR therapies like Casgevy (treating sickle cell disease) represent breakthroughs, Doudna acknowledged the technology "has, in many ways, not lived up to the hope and hype just yet"—therapies remain expensive and difficult to distribute throughout the body. She's convinced major breakthroughs are imminent.

[The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/the-status-quo-machine-hidden-system-turns-operators-into-culture-problems) published a satirical "leaked memo from the Guardians of Decay"—corporate operating instructions for maintaining the status quo. The piece skewered how organizations preserve hierarchies while paying lip service to networks, protect quarterly numbers while sacrificing people ("People grow back"), display values on walls while fostering fear, and use consultants to "turn your hunches into inevitabilities."

> "You can run a company like this for a very long time. It might even last a lot longer than you might think. You'll see the building continue to fill with people every morning, many who once believed they were there to do work that actually mattered." — [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/the-status-quo-machine-hidden-system-turns-operators-into-culture-problems)

In a companion piece, [The Whirl](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/angus-fletcher-narrative-intelligence-ooda-commanders-intent-red-teaming-truth-psyop) interviewed Angus Fletcher on applying Boyd's OODA loop with storytelling. Fletcher's key insight: "the human brain isn't a calculator but a story engine built for action under uncertainty." He argued intuition isn't pattern-matching but "detecting exceptional information, the mismatch that signals new opportunity," and that planning's value is "training the planner" rather than producing rigid plans.

[News Minimalist](https://newsletter.newsminimalist.com/p/india-and-eu-reach-a-free-trade-deal-representing-a-third-of-global-trade-11-more-stories) provided AI-curated global news: India-EU free trade agreement (representing a third of global trade), Doomsday Clock moved to 85 seconds before midnight, AI discovering 1,400 cosmic anomalies in Hubble data, OpenAI launching ChatGPT Prism with GPT-5.2, and gold prices reaching record highs.

### 7. Design, Typography, and Craft

**Coverage:** [Beth Mathews](https://bethmathews.substack.com/p/3-things-i-learned-from-a-vintage), [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-lo-fi-mark-of-a-real-one)

[Beth Mathews](https://bethmathews.substack.com/p/3-things-i-learned-from-a-vintage) explored lessons from a 1950s Trust-Franklin Press Type Specimen Book purchased on eBay. She highlighted Bank Script (created 1895, used in banking documents for over a century) and examined the point system notation—"an early look at the point system. The same one we use today for typeface sizes. The point system comes from metal type, where each size was a physically different block of metal."

[Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-lo-fi-mark-of-a-real-one) published "The Lo-fi Mark of a Real One," advocating for makers who run "extremely Lo-fi sites" as a trust signal. The piece explored "building a sustained relationship with your clothes over time" and the "strange pleasure of digging something back out and re-encountering a once-familiar part of yourself you'd put on hiatus."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Delegation Dilemma

Three newsletters explored different dimensions of effective delegation: [Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/management-as-ai-superpower) to AI agents, [Scott Werner](https://worksonmymachine.ai/p/the-different-shapes-of-think-before) to oracles/LLMs, and [The Whirl](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/angus-fletcher-narrative-intelligence-ooda-commanders-intent-red-teaming-truth-psyop) via Commander's Intent. All converged on the insight that clarity of intent and evaluation capacity matter more than clever techniques. Mollick: "management 101 skills." Werner: "make the Oracle say what good is, out loud, before you make it do good." Fletcher: "Commander's Intent gives the ending and protects agency."

### Authenticity Under Pressure

[Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/are-good-clothes-boring), [Olga](https://dataanalysis.substack.com/p/celebrating-300th-newsletter), and [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-seduction-of-suffering) all grappled with how authenticity gets corrupted or performative. Slow Clothes brands face carpetbaggers and status-seekers. Newsletter creators face the "quantity over quality" treadmill and burnout. Suffering becomes "curated" and gains "social signature." The pattern: what starts as genuine response to need becomes legible, gains currency, then attracts extractive or performative engagement that hollows out the original value.

### Institutional Decay and Capture

[The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/9a50ae8e-2328-4a2b-bb7e-09fa302813bf?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) on speech suppression in NY AG's office, [The Whirl](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/the-status-quo-machine-hidden-system-turns-operators-into-culture-problems) on corporate status quo machines, and both [Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/44dbf5dc-05d0-47b8-be3b-460e0ca56ae9?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) pieces on Minneapolis and Iran documented systems prioritizing self-preservation over mission. Whether through "outside activities" policies silencing dissent, consultants validating hunches as "best practices," or state violence crushing protests, the pattern repeats: institutions that lose connection to purpose become defensive, performative, and eventually predatory toward those who remember the original mission.

### The Tyranny of Legibility

Multiple newsletters highlighted how making things legible—to algorithms, markets, or status games—distorts their nature. [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-seduction-of-suffering): "The danger is when [suffering] becomes legible in a way that life no longer is." [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/are-good-clothes-boring): slow clothes becoming fashionable creates "the same market obstacle any trend faces once it reaches critical mass: customer fatigue." [Olga](https://dataanalysis.substack.com/p/celebrating-300th-newsletter): "Your audience isn't you"—what's obvious in your bubble requires translation, but translation risks oversimplification. The more something succeeds by being understood, the more it must compromise the complexity that made it valuable.
