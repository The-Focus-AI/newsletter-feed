# Week 05 Misc Newsletter Analysis (January 20-26, 2026)

## Overview

Week 05 brought a collision of technological ambition, political turbulence, and profound ethical questions. [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/ad401c49-11e1-4540-9ac0-d709452a537b?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) dominated the week with wall-to-wall coverage of Trump's aggressive geopolitical maneuvering over Greenland, while [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/the-lines-have-been-drawn) sounded the alarm over what he characterized as the crystallization of American authoritarianism following ICE killings in Minneapolis. Meanwhile, [Core Memory](https://substack.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.JXw3k5ltN2qPLTQ_T-X_QpcgC3v0DJ6r-nfvYU2_6yg?) explored deep-sea mining ethics and [Jeremy D Johnson](https://jeremydjohnson.substack.com/p/reclaiming-time-for-deep-reading) championed slow, contemplative reading as resistance to algorithmic capture.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Trump's AI Policy as State Power Consolidation
**Coverage:** [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/what-trump-really-wants-with-ai)

Brian Merchant delivered a sharp analysis arguing that Trump's AI policy is fundamentally about federal power concentration, not deregulation. Drawing on policy papers by Alondra Nelson and Brian J. Chen, Merchant argues that Trump's administration is orchestrating "an enormous state project" involving federal stakes in private companies, favorable land-use policies for data centers, and categorical exemptions from environmental review.

> "Trump is not removing government from AI regulation; it is concentrating governmental power at the federal level while deploying it through mechanisms—investment, ownership, research funding, immigration controls, and preemption—not typically classified as 'regulation.'" — [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/what-trump-really-wants-with-ai)

Merchant notes the federal government took a 10% stake in Intel for $9 billion and has invested hundreds of millions in eight other companies crucial to tech supply chains. The ultimate aim, he argues, is both imperial expansion and gangster capitalism—Trump securing leverage over an industry increasingly dependent on his largesse.

### 2. Minneapolis ICE Killings and the Crystallization of Authoritarianism
**Coverage:** [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/the-lines-have-been-drawn), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/80d66057-d25b-4393-a891-fa57206ecf22?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

The execution of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse shot by federal officers in Minneapolis, marked what [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/the-lines-have-been-drawn) called "the horror of systematization." Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem claimed Pretti was "brandishing" his weapon and wanted to "massacre law enforcement," but eyewitness videos contradicted the official narrative.

> "The lines have been drawn. American fascism—or authoritarianism, or autocracy, or whatever you want to call its equivalent—has materialized." — [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/the-lines-have-been-drawn)

[The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/80d66057-d25b-4393-a891-fa57206ecf22?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) editorial condemned the "information war" following Pretti's killing, noting the Trump administration was "taking the American people for fools." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Democrats would not vote for any spending bill funding DHS after the killing.

### 3. Trump's Greenland Theater and Davos Dominance
**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/7ad42d8f-44c5-48f3-a282-073102a7b534?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [Mailbrew](content/misc/mailbrew/)

Niall Ferguson, reporting from Davos for [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/7ad42d8f-44c5-48f3-a282-073102a7b534?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), argued that Trump didn't lose at Davos—he owned it. European leaders believed they had "stood up" to Trump over Greenland, but Ferguson suggests the entire spectacle was "Trumpian maskirovka"—a distraction to keep Europeans from meddling in Iran and Ukraine policy.

> "The reason Trump forced Greenland to be the No. 1 topic at Davos, I suspect, was to keep European leaders from meddling in America's Middle Eastern and Eastern European policy." — [Niall Ferguson](https://substack.com/redirect/7ad42d8f-44c5-48f3-a282-073102a7b534?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

Ferguson notes Trump habitually bluffs half the time on Truth Social, and taking him "seriously but not literally" remains the correct approach. While Europeans debated Greenland, Trump's envoys headed to Moscow for Ukraine peace talks and the USS Abraham Lincoln moved toward the Persian Gulf for potential Iran strikes.

### 4. Canada's Assisted Suicide Crisis
**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/a88c2fc6-ed03-46aa-9ae0-eaffd0a55088?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

[The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/a88c2fc6-ed03-46aa-9ae0-eaffd0a55088?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) published a devastating account of Kiano Vafaeian, a 26-year-old blind man killed through Canada's MAID (Medical Assistance in Dying) program on December 30. Just weeks before, Vafaeian had been working out at a gym, saving money, and planning to move into a new condo his mother had furnished for him.

Canada now has one of the world's highest assisted suicide rates at 5.1% of all deaths (16,499 in 2024). The fastest-growing category isn't cancer or heart disease but a catch-all labeled "other"—nearly doubling to 4,255 deaths in 2023. Dr. Ellen Wiebe, one of Canada's most prolific MAID practitioners, has helped over 500 patients die and calls it "the best work I've ever done."

> "MAID opens the door to young people who are struggling. Where normally the healthcare system would have insisted there is hope, some physicians now say: If that's how you feel, I'm here to help you end your life." — [Trudo Lemmens](https://substack.com/redirect/a88c2fc6-ed03-46aa-9ae0-eaffd0a55088?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

### 5. Deep Reading as Cultural Resistance
**Coverage:** [Jeremy D Johnson](https://jeremydjohnson.substack.com/p/reclaiming-time-for-deep-reading)

[Jeremy D Johnson](https://jeremydjohnson.substack.com/p/reclaiming-time-for-deep-reading) made an impassioned case for deep philosophical reading as an act of resistance against "relentless algorithmic capture." He's launching a class on Jean Gebser's The Ever-Present Origin, arguing that meaningful time—the kind required for transformation—must be "found, not forced."

> "These times call for us to turn towards meaning, not mechanism. We need to make the choice to reclaim time from relentless algorithmic capture." — [Jeremy D Johnson](https://jeremydjohnson.substack.com/p/reclaiming-time-for-deep-reading)

Johnson notes a "quiet renaissance" emerging in para-academic spaces where "voluntary seriousness" replaces credential-seeking. He argues Gebser's work on integral consciousness and time perception offers tools for "inhabiting the tensions of the ecological 'middle'" between catastrophe and metamorphosis.

### 6. Deep-Sea Mining and the Last Frontier

The discovery of "dark oxygen" production by these nodules has raised profound questions about where aerobic life began.

Companies like The Metals Company and Impossible Metals are racing to commercialize extraction, but scientists warn that whatever is altered will remain disrupted for decades. One study found biological disturbances continued 44 years after nodules were removed.

> "Just because something is a low-biomass ecosystem doesn't mean we should just destroy it." — [Dr. Andrew Sweetman](https://substack.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.JXw3k5ltN2qPLTQ_T-X_QpcgC3v0DJ6r-nfvYU2_6yg?)

### 8. Robot Auras and Post-Anthropomorphic Design
**Coverage:** [Contraptions](https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/robot-auras)

Venkatesh Rao explored "robot auras" inspired by Iain M. Banks' Culture novels—visual fields that communicate robot internal states without anthropomorphizing them. He argues against three dominant design philosophies (industrial dashboard, googly-eyes cuteness, realistic biomorphism) in favor of affect displays that code machine-native personality.

> "Asimovian and Banksian robot futures are in obvious tension. A three-laws approach to keeping robots safe and effective would be something of a late-modern industrial approach." — [Venkatesh Rao](https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/robot-auras)

Rao proposes "entangled auras architectures" where responsibility for safe robot existence is shared between robots, humans, and animals through affect displays that all species can learn to interpret.

### 9. Network-Centric Warfare and John Boyd's Legacy
**Coverage:** [The Whirl Of ReOrientation](content/misc/the-whirl-of-reorientation-escape-the-sc/)

Multiple pieces from [The Whirl Of ReOrientation](content/misc/the-whirl-of-reorientation-escape-the-sc/) explored John Boyd's strategic thinking, particularly the OODA loop and network-centric warfare. The newsletter emphasized that Boyd's 99th birthday (January 23) marks an opportunity to reject "loop-speed-worship" in favor of understanding Orientation as the decisive human advantage.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The State and Technology Convergence
[Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/what-trump-really-wants-with-ai), [Core Memory](https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29yZW1lbW9yeS5jb20vcC9oZS1sZWZ0LW9wZW5haS1qZXJyeS10d29yZWs_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWVtYWlsLXBvc3Qmcj0xaWVmeSZ0b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TlRNNE1UUXlMQ0p3YjNOMFgybGtJam94T0RVeU5UUTRNakFzSW1saGRDSTZNVGMyT0RrNU56RXpNQ3dpWlhod0lqb3hOemN4TlRnNU1UTXdMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSndkV0l0TXpJd09UazJJaXdpYzNWaUlqb2ljRzl6ZEMxeVpXRmpkR2x2YmlKOS53Sktfc2NjNnA5TnhNUzhtZ2VUcHhkaGt2S3NTRUg4d3hHam5VYmdsSXM0IiwicCI6MTg1MjU0ODIwLCJzIjozMjA5OTYsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyNTM4MTQyLCJpYXQiOjE3Njg5OTcxMzAsImV4cCI6MjA4NDU3MzEzMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.5uq0KvcmTUR8uA6n9yVeSJtdPdBVVFyRiu371smSEOQ?), and [News Minimalist](content/misc/news-minimalist/) all touched on the deepening entanglement of state power and technology. Merchant's analysis of Trump's AI policy as federal power consolidation parallels news of Google integrating AI with personal Gmail and Photos data, while U.S. defense strategy shifts toward Western Hemisphere priorities.

### Death, Agency, and the State
[The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/a88c2fc6-ed03-46aa-9ae0-eaffd0a55088?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) and [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/the-lines-have-been-drawn) both grappled with state-sanctioned death this week—one through Canada's expanding assisted suicide regime, the other through federal killings in Minneapolis. Both raise questions about when individual agency ends and state power begins.

### Resistance Through Different Modes
Multiple newsletters explored forms of resistance: [Jeremy D Johnson](https://jeremydjohnson.substack.com/p/reclaiming-time-for-deep-reading) advocated deep reading as escape from algorithmic capture, [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/the-lines-have-been-drawn) called for organizing against authoritarianism, and [The Whirl Of ReOrientation](content/misc/the-whirl-of-reorientation-escape-the-sc/) promoted Boyd's strategic thinking as tools for "free and independent action."

### The Ethics of Frontier Exploitation
[Core Memory](https://substack.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.JXw3k5ltN2qPLTQ_T-X_QpcgC3v0DJ6r-nfvYU2_6yg?)'s deep-sea mining story and [Steven Johnson](https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/the-wetlands-interregnum)'s exploration of how declassified Corona satellite imagery revealed Mesopotamian wetlands challenge narratives of inevitable progress at any cost. Both question whether we should exploit Earth's last frontiers before understanding their ecological value.
