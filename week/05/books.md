## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. The Lost Art of Esoteric Writing
**Coverage:** [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/joint-review-philosophy-between-the?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app)

In a remarkable joint review of Arthur M. Melzer's *Philosophy Between the Lines*, Jane and John Psmith reveal how modern readers have forgotten that philosophers deliberately hid their true teachings "between the lines":

> "For at least the past two hundred fifty years, literally all of Western civilization has been reading philosophy wrong." — [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/joint-review-philosophy-between-the?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app)

Until the mid-18th century, everyone understood that philosophers wrote esoterically—with one public doctrine for the masses and hidden meanings for careful readers. The Encyclopédie casually explained that ancient philosophers had "a double doctrine; the one external, public or exoteric; the other internal, secret or esoteric."

This wasn't paranoia. Aquinas wrote that certain matters "should be concealed with obscure language, so that they will benefit the wise who understand them and be hidden from the uneducated." The Psmiths identify four reasons for esoteric writing: defensive (protecting the philosopher from persecution), protective (shielding society from dangerous ideas), pedagogical (teaching through struggle), and political (navigating power structures).

The implications are staggering. We may have fundamentally misunderstood core texts: Aristotle's "natural slavery" passage might be deliberate irony; Plato's *Republic* may not actually endorse separating children from parents. If we've forgotten how to read esoterically, we're essentially reading different texts than our philosophical ancestors did.

### 2. The Fanfic-to-Romance Publishing Pipeline
**Coverage:** [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28q261a.12sr/7dbe95bb)

[Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28q261a.12sr/7dbe95bb) interviewed Deidre Knight, agent for Rachel Reid, whose hockey romance series has sold approximately 2 million copies after being adapted for TV. Reid originally posted the story on Archive of Our Own as fanfiction. Knight explained that agents actively scout fanfic sites:

> "People that come from fanfic are, a lot of the time, really super-well equipped to do well in publishing: Fanfic readers have expectations. You're juggling multiple stories that you're writing across genres and you have tight fandom deadlines." — [Deidre Knight, Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28q261a.12sr/7dbe95bb)

The success of *Heated Rivalry* has had real-world effects: StubHub reported a 75% increase in hockey-game searches, and Knight sold another M/M hockey series by Jenny Linsky—one of the most popular hockey fanfic authors on AO3—to Ballantine Bantam Dell at auction. The book, *You've Got Kudos*, is "delicious and so fanfic adjacent" about a hockey player who discovers gay fan fiction about himself.

The article also covered Jennette McCurdy's *Half His Age* launch with Lena Dunham, exploring a teenager's relationship with her 41-year-old creative writing teacher. Emma Alpern's review of George Saunders's *Vigil* recommended readers "skip" it, calling it "a fantasy of authorial moral omniscience that verges on sanctimony."

### 3. Democracy and the Cyclical Nature of Political Corruption
**Coverage:** [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/democracy-by-henry-adams), [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhyd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-m)

[Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/democracy-by-henry-adams) reviewed Henry Adams's 1880 anonymous bestseller *Democracy*, which follows a young widow entering Washington society and discovering that "democracy is the government of the people, by the people, for the benefit of Senators." Adams, grandson of John Adams, watched the American republic descend from the Founders' ideals to Gilded Age corruption.

The novel's cynical senator tells Mrs. Lee: "If Washington were President now, he would have to learn our ways or lose his next election. Only fools and theorists imagine that our society can be handled with gloves or long poles." Oliver notes that while specific scandals feel quaint, Adams captures something timeless about corruption's culture—that certain kinds of amoral excellence exist in politics.

[The New York Review](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhyd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-m) published "The Politics of Raw Power," with Joseph O'Neill arguing we're witnessing the death of the rule of law, though "not in an authoritarian society yet, because the suspension of the rule of law isn't ubiquitous or embedded."

### 4. The Defense of Literature and Tacit Knowledge
**Coverage:** [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should)

In a passionate essay, [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should) wrestled with justifying literature in an age demanding instrumental reasons for everything:

> "We don't need arguments for the humanities. No-one argues that we need bees or flowers or summer rain. Obviously it is good and necessary to have the academic humanities." — [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should)

Oliver traces how Renaissance humanism discovered that better translations of classical texts undermined medieval theology's logical edifice. The humanists found their answer not in reason but in imagination—"Good men expressed themselves in good letters. Good letters made good men." Literature works through tacit knowledge that "cannot be taught; it must be experienced."

Drawing on Iris Murdoch and Ingmar Bergman, Oliver distinguishes between "fantasy" (predictable escapism) and true imagination (wrestling with reality's mysteries). The essay culminates in his argument that "Music and poesy use to quicken you. That's it, that's the reason."

### 5. Literary Criticism and Contemporary Fiction
**Coverage:** [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://open.substack.com/pub/commonreader/p/andrew-gelman-reviews-erin-somers?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app), [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhik-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jk)

[Henry Oliver](https://open.substack.com/pub/commonreader/p/andrew-gelman-reviews-erin-somers?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app) highlighted statistician Andrew Gelman's review of Erin Somers's *The Ten Year Affair*, praising how Somers captures parenthood more realistically than Updike or Roth. Updike "was to the end of his life always a son, never a father," with children existing only as obstacles. In contrast, "the adults in *The Ten Year Affair* are very aware of their kids."

Oliver identified "inverted Free Indirect Style" where social media discourse ventriloquizes through characters: "totems of millennial soft masculinity" feels drawn from Twitter rather than the character's consciousness, reversing how Free Indirect Style typically works.

[The New York Review](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhik-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jk) featured Hermione Lee on Gertrude Stein's "life and afterlife," treating her as "a philosopher of language to trust, not explain." William H. Gass emphasized Stein's revolutionary approach: "Gertrude Stein did more with sentences, and understood them better, than any other writer ever has."

### 6. The Commenters Won: Online Discourse and Political Power
**Coverage:** [Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-commenters-won)

[Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-commenters-won) traced a bizarre throughline in contemporary politics: Trump administration staffers radicalized by being banned from comment sections. One official told Semafor that "a radicalizing experience was being booted out of the Gawker comments section, way back in the day."

> "We are ruled, as it turned out, not only by ghouls, fascists, sociopaths, salesmen, influencers, mediocrities, and abusers, but by something stranger and potentially worse: Gawker commenters." — [Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-commenters-won)

Read argues that being a regular commenter creates a specific pathology: "Your voice is (literally) suppressed, made subordinate, often hidden; your intelligence and expertise receives a fraction of the attention of the glib P.M.C. blogger you're responding to." Sarah B. Rogers, Trump's "free speech tsar," ran four sock puppet Gawker accounts to defend herself preemptively.

### 7. Translation, World Literature, and Visual Culture
**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhkrty-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a), [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aydtjit-36F2A313-iruduywlh-d), [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asqid-36F2A313-iruduywlh-tk)

[NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhkrty-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a) promoted César Vallejo's *Trilce* (1922), which "transformed poetry in Spanish utterly, remaking the substance of verse from the word up." The new bilingual edition includes glosses by translators Helen Dimos and William Rowe, opening these "legendarily challenging poems" to new understanding.

[NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aydtjit-36F2A313-iruduywlh-d) also featured Michel Tournier's *Friday*, a retelling of Robinson Crusoe that asks: "What was Friday to Daniel Defoe? Nothing: an animal, at best a creature waiting to receive his humanity from Robinson Crusoe."

Art editor Leanne Shapton's ["Neigh!" newsletter](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asqid-36F2A313-iruduywlh-tk) detailed the artistic process behind the January 15 issue, from Izzy Barber's glowing nighttime interiors to Yann Kebbi's portrait of Booker Prize winner David Szalay.

### 8. Children's Literature Awards and New Releases
**Coverage:** [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KFXZ50YPN6K5BTJ4B5MW00GP_3), [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KG02R40BV75TYVCGKWJC6BV7_3)

[Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KFXZ50YPN6K5BTJ4B5MW00GP_3) announced the 2026 Newbery Medal winner (*All the Blues in the Sky* by Renée Watson, about thirteen-year-old Sage dealing with grief) and Caldecott Medal winner (*Fireworks* by Matthew Burgess, celebrating "magic in simple moments during a steamy July day").

[Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KG02R40BV75TYVCGKWJC6BV7_3) also featured new releases including George Saunders's *Vigil* ("a haunting deathbed journey"), Alice Evelyn Yang's *A Beast Slinks Towards Beijing* ("folklore-rich multigenerational saga"), and Stephen Fishbach's *Escape!* ("a twisty thriller set on a remote island where reality TV becomes dangerously real").

### 9. Nonfiction, Chickens, and Reader Tools
**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhxyk-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jr), [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhnil-36F2A313-iruduywlh-dl)

Ian Frazier's essay ["A Chicken in Every Pot"](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhxyk-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jr) traced the history of poultry from the red jungle fowl to "Hen Fever" in 19th-century Boston to today's industrial farms—"a Dantean hellscape." Chickens are now "the most populous terrestrial vertebrate," comprising "70 percent of all birds by weight."

[The Reader's Catalog](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhnil-36F2A313-iruduywlh-dl) promoted "Libraries Save Democracy" tote bags (featuring FDR's quote: "I have an unshaken conviction that democracy can never be undermined if we maintain our library resources"), old-school lap desks, and wearable LED reading lights.

### 10. The Mercatus Center and Liberal Education
**Coverage:** [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/come-and-be-my-intern-to-talk-about)

[Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/come-and-be-my-intern-to-talk-about) announced a summer internship at the Mercatus Center focusing on classical liberalism and literature. The program will explore how "there is no liberal tradition without great literature"—Mill was an important poetry critic, Berlin's work relied on fiction, and Jane Austen was "every bit a part of the liberal Enlightenment as Adam Smith."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Problem of Justification

Multiple newsletters grappled with how to justify cultural pursuits in an age demanding instrumental reasons. [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should) argued literature doesn't need justification beyond its existence, while the [Psmiths](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/joint-review-philosophy-between-the?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app) showed how philosophers once wrote esoterically precisely because they couldn't openly justify conclusions. [NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awhug-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p) promoted Boehm's call for "radical universalism" beyond narrow identity categories. All resist the modern demand for explicit justifications, arguing for knowledge that must be experienced or kept partially hidden.

### The Internet's Long Shadow

[Max Read's](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-commenters-won) analysis of Gawker commenter resentment morphing into Trumpist politics intersects with [Oliver's](https://open.substack.com/pub/commonreader/p/andrew-gelman-reviews-erin-somers?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app) observation about "inverted Free Indirect Style" importing Twitter-speak into fiction. Online discourse infiltrates political psychology, literary technique, and how we think. The "totems of millennial soft masculinity" Oliver identifies could come from a comment section, just as the comment section resentments Read chronicles now shape foreign policy.

### Alternate Publishing Pathways

[Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28q261a.12sr/7dbe95bb) showed how fanfiction sites have become farm teams for traditional publishing, with agents actively scouting AO3. This represents a fundamental shift—bottom-up rather than top-down, driven by reader engagement rather than gatekeepers. Knight's sale of Jenny Linsky's *You've Got Kudos* (about a hockey player discovering fanfic about himself) exemplifies how the industry now embraces this pipeline.

### The Cyclical Nature of Political Corruption

From [O'Neill's warnings](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhyd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-m) about authoritarianism to [Adams's 1880 satire](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/democracy-by-henry-adams) to [Read's account](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-commenters-won) of banned commenters running the State Department, this week documented cyclical patterns of institutional decay. What varies is whether this represents tragedy or inevitable human nature.

### The Value of Close Reading

Whether discussing [esoteric philosophy](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/joint-review-philosophy-between-the?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app), [19th-century satire](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/democracy-by-henry-adams), or [contemporary fiction](https://open.substack.com/pub/commonreader/p/andrew-gelman-reviews-erin-somers?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app), multiple newsletters emphasized slow, careful reading. The Psmiths quoted Melzer: "Esoteric reading, being very difficult, requires one to slow down and spend much more time with a book than one may be used to."

## Surprising Elements

- **Civilizational forgetting at scale**: The revelation from the [Psmiths](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/joint-review-philosophy-between-the?utm_source=email&redirect=app-store&utm_campaign=email-read-in-app) that we've collectively forgotten how to read philosophy—and forgotten that we forgot—is genuinely shocking.

- **Gawker commenters in government**: [Max Read's report](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-commenters-won) that Trump appointees include banned Gawker commenters who ran multiple sock puppet accounts reveals an unexpected through-line in American political evolution.

- **Hockey romance's cultural impact**: [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28q261a.12sr/7dbe95bb) reports a 75% increase in hockey-game searches following *Heated Rivalry*'s TV adaptation—books can still drive real-world behavior.

- **Publishers caught off-guard**: Despite *Letterkenny*'s success, chain buyers took a "wait-and-see stance" on Reid's books, leading to weeks when physical copies were impossible to find—a case study in publishing's inability to predict cultural moments.

- **Chickens everywhere**: Ian Frazier's revelation that chickens are now "70 percent of all birds by weight" and "45 percent of all the meat that Americans eat" from [NYRB](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhxyk-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jr) reframes our relationship with the natural world.
