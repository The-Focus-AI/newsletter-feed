## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. The Fanfiction-to-Publishing Pipeline and Hockey Romance
**Coverage:** [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28q261a.12sr/7dbe95bb)

The extraordinary success of Rachel Reid's "Game Changers" series continues to reshape romance publishing. With approximately 2 million copies sold following the TV adaptation, the series has validated what agent Deidre Knight calls the fanfic-to-romance pipeline. Knight, who represents Reid, told Book Gossip that she actively scouts Archive of Our Own for talent:

> "People that come from fanfic are, a lot of the time, really super-well equipped to do well in publishing: Fanfic readers have expectations. You're juggling multiple stories that you're writing across genres and you have tight fandom deadlines." — [Deidre Knight](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28q261a.12sr/7dbe95bb)

Knight sold another M/M hockey series by Jenny Linsky at auction in November—a meta story about a hockey player who discovers gay fan fiction about himself. The industry debate continues over whether the success will translate to more hockey romances, more queer sports stories, or simply better visibility for marginalized authors. Harlequin editor John Jacobson noted challenges: "We've seen large mass retailers being more hesitant to take on content that could be seen as controversial."

The article also covered Jennette McCurdy's novel Half His Age, reviewed George Saunders' Vigil (verdict: "Skip"), and noted that downloads of the "Game Changers" series through New York Public Library spiked to 13,000 after they were made available for free through Valentine's Day.

### 2. Literary Canon Debates: Henry James and the Limits of Popular Fiction
**Coverage:** [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/henry-james-plus-small-engines-fairies)

In a passionate defense of late-period Henry James, Oliver articulated a vision of literature as irreducible to simple accessibility. While re-reading The Wings of the Dove in preparation for The Golden Bowl, Oliver confessed his "lifelong ambivalence to James" stemmed from attempting the earlier work:

> "I simply do not understand all the fuss that gets made about The Portrait of a Lady when we could all be worshipping The Golden Bowl." — [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/henry-james-plus-small-engines-fairies)

Oliver highlighted James's famous distinction between the real and the romantic, noting how late James makes "the beautiful circuit and subterfuge of our thought and our desire not only the style of his narrative but the substance of his investigations."

Beyond James, Oliver offered quick takes on multiple books: he found Claire Keegan's Small Things Like These overly moralistic ("Dickens it a'int"), enjoyed Stanislaw Lem's Mortal Engines without finding it memorable, and was enchanted by Perrault's Fairy Tales. Most strikingly, he declared his rapture with Edith Wharton after reading The House of Mirth and The Age of Innocence: "OH MY GOD THESE NOVELS."

### 3. The Cultural Politics of Reading and "Suicide Rightism"
**Coverage:** [Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/p/suicide-rightism-and-the-penguin)

In a striking piece of cultural criticism, Max Read connected right-wing political mythology to a broader ideology he terms "suicide rightism"—an embrace of spectacular self-destruction as heroic. Read traced connections from Michael Anton's 2016 "Flight 93 Election" essay through "Sky King" (Richard Russell's 2018 plane theft and crash) to the Department of Homeland Security's viral penguin video.

The piece analyzed how these narratives transform from calculated risk ("charge the cockpit or die") to the celebration of pointless suicide itself. Read noted the irony of this "soy" ideology:

> "What's funny about Suicide Rightism is how direct it is about all this. You don't need some big theoretical analysis; there's no level of abstraction to move through. It's just pretty straightforwardly pro-suicide." — [Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/p/suicide-rightism-and-the-penguin)

The essay connected this phenomenon to literary figures like Yukio Mishima and cultural icons like "Killdozer," suggesting that the promise of Trumpism to its adherents is ultimately "oblivion."

### 4. The Publishing Industry and New Releases
**Coverage:** [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KG02R40BV75TYVCGKWJC6BV7_3), [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KGAN4QTGT9ANPM3ZGJ9C0WWS_6), [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayutthy-36F2A313-iruduywlh-x)

Multiple newsletters highlighted George Saunders' new novel Vigil as a major release. [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KG02R40BV75TYVCGKWJC6BV7_3) featured it prominently alongside Alice Evelyn Yang's A Beast Slinks Towards Beijing and Stephen Fishbach's Escape!

Other notable coverage included:
- The 2026 Newbery and Caldecott Medal winners, with [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KGAN4QTGT9ANPM3ZGJ9C0WWS_6) noting these awards "follow kids and teens from all walks of life"
- [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayutthy-36F2A313-iruduywlh-x) promoted Richard Hell's novel Godlike at 25% off, describing it as a "vital and visceral" transposition of the Verlaine-Rimbaud romance to 1970s East Village
- All We Say, a collection climbing bestseller lists featuring speeches "exploring what it means to be American"

### 5. Weather, Nature, and Endurance
**Coverage:** [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/ice-storm), [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhxyk-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jr)

Two newsletters meditated on weather and natural forces. Oliver's "Ice storm" dispatch from Arlington described the massive winter storm that left a million Americans without power, transforming it into a reflection on American character:

> "Whether the weather shapes the American character, or selected Americans who could persist with its extremities—the heat, the mosquitoes, the hurricanes, the floods, the fires, the earthquakes: this is a land of the unbearable and unimaginable, constantly being overcome." — [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/ice-storm)

[The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhxyk-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jr) featured Ian Frazier's essay "Bang the Drumstick Slowly" about chickens, noting that "26 billion chickens occupy Earth" and that they comprise "70 percent of all birds by weight" and "45 percent of all the meat that Americans eat."

### 6. Political Writing and Current Events
**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhftl-36F2A313-iruduywlh-ti), [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aykhikk-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jh)

The New York Review of Books published multiple pieces on Trump administration violence and authoritarianism. Fintan O'Toole wrote ["The Crime of Witness"](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhftl-36F2A313-iruduywlh-ti) about murders in Minneapolis, while Robin Kaiser-Schatzlein reported from the ground in ["Fifteen Below Zero"](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aykhikk-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jh) on "Operation Metro Surge."

The Review also announced an upcoming conversation between Fintan O'Toole, Alma Guillermoprieto, and Michael Ignatieff on "American Imperialism and the End of Sovereignty."

### 7. Classical Liberal Philosophy and Literature
**Coverage:** [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/come-and-be-my-intern-to-talk-about)

Oliver announced a summer internship at the Mercatus Center focused on classical liberalism with an unusual literary bent:

> "There is no liberal tradition without great literature. Mill was an important poetry critic. Isaiah Berlin's work is reliant on his reading of poetry and fiction. Jane Austen was every bit a part of the liberal Enlightenment as Adam Smith." — [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/come-and-be-my-intern-to-talk-about)

The position would involve reading J.S. Mill extensively alongside Shakespeare, Hayek, and potentially student-selected works exploring themes like "the liberal impulse in Henry James" or "the inherent conflict between pluralism and aesthetics."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Legitimacy Question
A recurring tension emerged between commercial/popular fiction and literary achievement. [Book Gossip](https://link.nymag.com/view/6356a99e6d2ff57c1382dd28q261a.12sr/7dbe95bb) documented how fanfiction routes to traditional publishing are becoming normalized, while [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/henry-james-plus-small-engines-fairies) championed the most challenging literary prose. Both perspectives are valid but represent fundamentally different visions of what books should do.

### Physical Experience and Materiality
Multiple newsletters grounded their reflections in physical experience: [Oliver's ice storm dispatch](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/ice-storm) connected weather to national character, [Frazier's chicken essay](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhxyk-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jr) in NYRB traced the "most populous terrestrial vertebrate," and promotional emails from [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhnil-36F2A313-iruduywlh-dl) emphasized tactile reading accessories (lap desks, book lights, reading glasses). There's a materialist turn here—a grounding in the bodily experience of reading and living.

### Political Violence and Authoritarianism
Both [Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/p/suicide-rightism-and-the-penguin) and [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhftl-36F2A313-iruduywlh-ti) addressed escalating state violence and the normalization of authoritarian impulses. Read's cultural analysis of "suicide rightism" paralleled O'Toole's reporting on actual violence in Minneapolis, suggesting that symbolic and material violence are converging.

### The Question of American Identity
What does it mean to be American? This question surfaced in [Oliver's reflections on American weather endurance](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/ice-storm), in [Bookshop.org's](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KGAN4QTGT9ANPM3ZGJ9C0WWS_6) promotion of All We Say (speeches about American identity), and in [NYRB's](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ajrltly-36F2A313-iruduywlh-v) announcement of a discussion on American imperialism.
