## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. The Defense of Literature and the Humanities

**Coverage:** [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should)

In a passionate, sprawling essay, Henry Oliver wrestles with justifying literature in an age that demands instrumental reasons for everything. Rather than offering another numbered list of literature's benefits, he argues for something more fundamental:

> "We don't need arguments for the humanities. No-one argues that we need bees or flowers or summer rain. Obviously it is good and necessary to have the academic humanities." — [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should)

Oliver traces the historical shift from medieval theology's logical arguments to Renaissance humanism's focus on language and expression, noting that "Good men expressed themselves in good letters. Good letters made good men." He finds his answer not in reason but in the imagination, arguing that literature teaches us to see "all sides of life" — neither creating little worlds of escapism nor serving as mere instruction, but as training for the soul.

Drawing on examples from Ingmar Bergman's *Fanny and Alexander* to Iris Murdoch's novels, Oliver distinguishes between "fantasy" (predictable escapism) and true imagination (wrestling with reality's mysteries). His central insight is that literature works through tacit knowledge — the kind that "cannot be taught; it must be experienced."

### 2. The Lost Art of Esoteric Writing

**Coverage:** [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/joint-review-philosophy-between-the)

In a remarkable joint review of Arthur M. Melzer's *Philosophy Between the Lines*, Jane and John Psmith reveal how modern readers have forgotten that philosophers from Plato to Rousseau deliberately hid their true teachings "between the lines" to protect themselves and society from dangerous ideas.

> "For at least the past two hundred fifty years, literally all of Western civilization has been reading philosophy wrong." — [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/joint-review-philosophy-between-the)

The review details how until the mid-18th century, everyone understood that philosophers wrote esoterically — with one public doctrine and another hidden meaning for careful readers. Aquinas wrote that certain matters "should be concealed with obscure language, so that they will benefit the wise who understand them and be hidden from the uneducated who are unable to grasp them."

But why write this way? The Psmiths identify four reasons: defensive (protecting the philosopher), protective (shielding society from dangerous ideas), pedagogical (teaching through struggle), and political (navigating power). Most fascinating is their insight that esoteric texts mimic conversation — they require the reader to imagine the author imagining the reader, creating an "intimate experience" across millennia.

The couple debates whether such writing is still possible today, with Jane noting that Orthodox Christian theology achieves something similar by prioritizing transformation over propositional knowledge, while John argues that dangerous truths still require camouflage in our supposedly open society.

### 3. Online Discourse and Political Power

**Coverage:** [Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-commenters-won)

Max Read traces a bizarre throughline in contemporary politics: Trump administration staffers who were radicalized by being banned from comment sections. One official told Semafor that "a radicalizing experience was being booted out of the Gawker comments section, way back in the day."

> "We are ruled, as it turned out, not only by ghouls, fascists, sociopaths, salesmen, influencers, mediocrities, and abusers, but by something stranger and potentially worse: Gawker commenters." — [Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-commenters-won)

Read argues that being a regular commenter creates a specific pathology: "Your voice is (literally) suppressed, made subordinate, often hidden; your intelligence and expertise receives a fraction of the attention of the glib P.M.C. blogger you're responding to, whose attention and approval you both scorn and desire." This resentment — at having something valuable to say but being structurally subordinated — maps perfectly onto the political psychology of Trumpism.

The essay culminates in revelations about Sarah B. Rogers, Trump's "free speech tsar," who ran four sock puppet Gawker accounts to defend herself preemptively and now leads the administration's war on European speech laws.

### 4. Democracy and Political Cynicism

**Coverage:** [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/democracy-by-henry-adams)

Oliver reviews Henry Adams's 1880 anonymous bestseller *Democracy*, which follows a young widow entering Washington society and discovering that "democracy is the government of the people, by the people, for the benefit of Senators." Adams, grandson of John Adams, watched the American republic descend "from the austere ideals of the Founders to the populism of Andrew Jackson and the corruption of the Gilded Age."

> "Moral education is impossible apart from the habitual vision of greatness." — Alfred North Whitehead, quoted in [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/democracy-by-henry-adams)

The novel's protagonist Mrs. Lee is torn between reason and belonging, discovering that even a ruthless senator can mount a "stout defence" of corruption as political necessity. Oliver notes that while the specific scandals feel quaint today, Adams captures something timeless about the culture of corruption — that certain kinds of amoral excellence exist in politics, and that "there is indeed a sort of ability and talent to the new way of doing politics."

### 5. Art, Literature, and Political Crisis

**Coverage:** [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhyd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-m), [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awhug-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p)

The NYRB delivered both urgent political analysis and thoughtful cultural criticism this week. Joseph O'Neill's dialogue piece "The Politics of Raw Power" examines the authoritarian turn in American politics, documenting ICE raids, killings of protesters, and the Democratic Party's failure to mount meaningful resistance. Meanwhile, the publication promoted Omri Boehm's *Radical Universalism*, which argues that contemporary politics on both left and right has devolved into identity politics, abandoning genuine humanistic universalism.

In a lighter register, art editor Leanne Shapton's "Neigh!" newsletter [detailed the artistic process](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-asqid-36F2A313-iruduywlh-tk) behind the January 15 issue, including paintings of racehorses, portraits of writers from Beryl Bainbridge to Fitz-James O'Brien, and illustrations ranging from Louise Bourgeois's blood-red work to Izzy Barber's glowing nighttime interiors.

[Hermione Lee's essay](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhik-36F2A313-iruduywlh-jk) on Gertrude Stein explored the modernist writer's reputation as either "the most remarkable creative experimentalist of her century" or "a ludicously self-inflated, intolerably repetitive, and dead-end mannerist" — a debate enriched by newly available archives.

### 6. Translation and World Literature

**Coverage:** [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhkrty-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a), [New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-aydtjit-36F2A313-iruduywlh-d)

NYRB promoted two significant translations: César Vallejo's *Trilce* (1922), which "transformed poetry in Spanish utterly, remaking the substance of verse from the word up," and Michel Tournier's *Friday*, a bold retelling of Robinson Crusoe that asks "What was Friday to Daniel Defoe? Nothing: an animal, at best a creature waiting to receive his humanity from Robinson Crusoe."

Both works exemplify how great translation opens doors to radical reimaginings of familiar stories and forms — Vallejo through neologisms and verbal play that create "a new poetic now," Tournier through stepping "out of the secular world of the Western novel into the sacred precincts of universal mythology."

### 7. Contemporary Fiction and Literary Technique

**Coverage:** [Henry Oliver from The Common Reader](https://open.substack.com/pub/commonreader/p/andrew-gelman-reviews-erin-somers)

Oliver highlighted statistician Andrew Gelman's review of Erin Somers's *The Ten Year Affair*, praising how Somers captures what it feels like to be a parent in ways that Updike and Roth never did. Gelman notes that while Updike's characters "always seem to be thinking only about themselves," with children existing only as obstacles, "the adults in *The Ten Year Affair* are very aware of their kids."

Oliver himself identified an intriguing technique he calls "inverted Free Indirect Style" — where instead of channeling a character's distinctive voice, the prose "ventriloquises discourse from outside the novel" using phrases like "totems of millennial soft masculinity" that feel drawn from "the common stock" of social media discourse.

### 8. Children's Literature and Awards

**Coverage:** [Bookshop.org](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01KFXZ50YPN6K5BTJ4B5MW00GP_3)

The American Library Association announced this year's Newbery and Caldecott Medal winners. The Newbery went to Renée Watson's *All the Blues in the Sky*, following thirteen-year-old Sage dealing with grief after her best friend's death. The Caldecott Medal went to Matthew Burgess's *Fireworks*, celebrating "magic in simple moments during a steamy July day in the city."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Problem of Justification

Multiple newsletters this week grappled with how to justify cultural and intellectual pursuits in an age demanding instrumental reasons for everything. [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should) argued that literature doesn't need justification beyond its existence as "good and necessary," while [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/joint-review-philosophy-between-the) showed how philosophers once wrote esoterically precisely because they couldn't openly justify their conclusions. [The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awhug-36F2A313-iruduywlh-p) promoted Omri Boehm's call for a return to "radical universalism" beyond narrow identity categories. All three sources resist the modern demand for explicit, rationalized justifications, arguing instead for forms of knowledge that must be experienced, struggled with, or kept partially hidden.

### Reason Versus Community

Both [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should) and [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's Bookshelf](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/joint-review-philosophy-between-the) explored the tension between rational truth-seeking and communal belonging. Oliver wrote that "We humans are strangely composite beings, combining together two different natures — like centaurs or, perhaps, schizophrenics," while the Psmiths explained that esoteric writing emerged from philosophy's "conflictual view of theory and praxis" — the recognition that reason and political community can never be fully harmonized. Both ultimately reject the Enlightenment's belief that we can bring all of life into alignment with reason.

### The Internet's Long Shadow

[Max Read's](https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-commenters-won) analysis of how Gawker commenter resentment morphed into Trumpist politics intersects with [Henry Oliver's](https://open.substack.com/pub/commonreader/p/andrew-gelman-reviews-erin-somers) observation about "inverted Free Indirect Style" importing Twitter-speak into fiction. Both suggest that online discourse doesn't stay online — it infiltrates political psychology, literary technique, and the very structure of how we think. The "totems of millennial soft masculinity" that Oliver identifies in Somers's novel could have come straight from a comment section, just as the comment section resentments Read chronicles are now shaping foreign policy.

### The Failure of Liberalism

[The New York Review of Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-awkhyd-36F2A313-iruduywlh-m) and [Henry Oliver's](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/democracy-by-henry-adams) review of Adams's *Democracy* both document the limitations of liberal proceduralism in the face of raw power. Joseph O'Neill writes that Democratic leadership "simply lack the temperament and strategic ability to counter Republican power moves," while Adams's novel shows how 19th-century reformers discovered that "democracy isn't good for" those who take it seriously. Both suggest that liberal norms work only when all parties agree to be bound by them — and collapse when one side decides to ignore the rules.

### Translation as Transformation

[New York Review Books](https://thenewyorkreview.updatemyprofile.com/y-ayhkrty-36F2A313-iruduywlh-a) promoted two translations — Vallejo's *Trilce* and Tournier's *Friday* — that exemplify how translation can be a radical act of reimagining rather than mere fidelity. This echoes themes in both [Henry Oliver's](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/good-letters-made-good-men-why-should) essay on how Renaissance humanism discovered "better translations" that undermined medieval theology, and [Mr. and Mrs. Psmith's](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepsmiths/p/joint-review-philosophy-between-the) discussion of esoteric writing (where meaning itself must be "translated" from surface to depth). All three suggest that accessing truth often requires moving between registers, languages, or levels of meaning.
