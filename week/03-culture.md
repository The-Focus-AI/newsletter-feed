# Week 03 Culture Newsletter Analysis (January 13-17, 2026)

## Overview

This week's culture newsletters converged on several urgent themes: the ongoing debate about social media's harm to adolescents, the intersection of technology and human embodiment, the specter of state violence and ICE raids in Minneapolis, and reflections on authenticity in the age of AI. [After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16) continued its campaign for social media age limits, while [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email) offered a nuanced exploration of how technology shapes our bodies and relationships. Meanwhile, [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/all-gas-town-no-brakes-town) and [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/97f1ed49?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) both featured reportage on the Trump administration's immigration raids, and [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/d2fb75d1?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) grappled with AI's encroachment on academic integrity.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Social Media and Youth Mental Health: The Case for Age Limits

**Coverage:** [After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16), [After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/mountains-of-evidence)

Jon Haidt's After Babel newsletter published two significant pieces this week making the case that social media is demonstrably unsafe for adolescents. The first argued that Australia's decision to set 16 as the minimum age for social media accounts should become a global standard, emphasizing the biological vulnerability of puberty.

> "Half or more of all girls are still in puberty on their 15th birthday, and half or more of all boys are still in puberty on their 16th birthday. This is a major reason why 16 is a much better choice for a minimum age than 15." -- [After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16)

The second piece presented what Haidt calls "mountains of evidence" from seven lines of research, including Meta's own internal studies that were leaked through litigation. The newsletter revealed that Meta conducted its own randomized control trial (Project Mercury) which found that "people who stopped using Facebook for a week reported lower feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and social comparison."

The newsletter proposes four features for effective age-limit policies: set the minimum at 16 or higher, make no exceptions for parental consent, focus on account creation rather than content access, and define social media by design features that cause harm.

### 2. Technology and the Body: A Philosophical Reckoning

**Coverage:** [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email)

Anne Helen Petersen's Culture Study featured an extensive interview with Dr. Vanessa Chang about her book "The Body Digital." The conversation explored how technologies have always choreographed our bodies -- from keyboards training our hands to smartphones scripting our attention.

> "Technologies have long choreographed our bodies and primed our senses: keyboards train our hands, smartphones script our attention, earbuds filter our soundscapes, and chatbots train us to write and think in new patterns." -- [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email)

Chang offered a compelling framework for evaluating technology: whether it "expands or contracts our horizons" and whether it makes us more curious or reduces us "to what can be measured and predicted." The interview included a fascinating discussion of the Situationists' concept of the "derive" (drift) as a model for reclaiming agency from optimization-driven technology.

### 3. AI, Vibe Coding, and the Future of Programming

**Coverage:** [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/all-gas-town-no-brakes-town)

Rusty Foster's Today in Tabs delivered an in-depth exploration of Steve Yegge's "Gas Town" -- a new development environment for managing multiple AI coding agents. The piece served as a meditation on "vibe coding," the practice of letting AI write code without necessarily reading or understanding it.

> "If vibe coders are trying to level themselves up to engineering manager, Gas Town is trying to skip its users all the way to CEO, with the entire management and workflow structure of a software development company recreated in AI." -- [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/all-gas-town-no-brakes-town)

Foster positioned himself as an "AI hater," quoting Anthony Moser: "the makers of AI aren't damned by their failures, they're damned by their goals. They want to build a genie to grant them wishes, and their wish is that nobody ever has to make art again."

### 4. ICE Raids and State Violence in Minneapolis

**Coverage:** [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/97f1ed49?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/what-have-self-148137146?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148137146&utm_id=40e538e6-fdc8-420d-bbff-cb47d3ec0289&utm_medium=email), [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/thank-god-it-s-whiskey-friday-with-tony-dokoupil), [Kottke.org](https://kottke.org/26/01/0048163-north-america-kind-of-suc)

Multiple newsletters addressed the Trump administration's immigration raids in Minneapolis. The Browser highlighted Ryan Broderick's Garbage Day reporting on how "brutal state violence and hysterical right-wing internet content work together in lockstep," with Substackers and YouTubers given ringside seats to document the operations.

[Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/what-have-self-148137146?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148137146&utm_id=40e538e6-fdc8-420d-bbff-cb47d3ec0289&utm_medium=email) opened its thread on self-knowledge systems with an acknowledgment of the crisis: "I know it feels weird to have mini-bulletins like this before talking about pop culture or personality tests or WHATEVER but this is what life is like right now: constant compartmentalization and negotiation."

[Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/thank-god-it-s-whiskey-friday-with-tony-dokoupil) linked to Winston Hearn's first-hand account from Minnesota, noting that despite "the ongoing risks presented by untrained clowns who will deploy weapons of war against literal children when they get scared," community response has been "so fucking powerful and beautiful."

[Kottke.org](https://kottke.org/26/01/0048163-north-america-kind-of-suc) linked to a website documenting ICE abuses in Minnesota (mn-ice-witness.org).

### 5. AI in Education and Questions of Authenticity

**Coverage:** [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/d2fb75d1?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

Jide Salawu's essay in Flaming Hydra grappled with AI's disruption of academic integrity. Writing from his experience teaching at the University of Alberta, Salawu pushed back against AI paranoia while acknowledging the genuine challenges.

> "Em dashes are beautiful; they are the pillar of emphasis in writing. They help put the crown on your phrases. But as Hajra Ghuman says that the em dash is accused, not of bad grammar, but of being an 'AI tell,' with the result that 'some professors and editors now treat this punctuation choice as forbidden fruit.'" -- [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/d2fb75d1?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

The piece concluded with a call for ethical engagement: "To use it ethically is the key. Never to surrender human agency to it."

### 6. Journalism, Attribution, and the Question of Credit

**Coverage:** [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/31f0be51?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

Jonathan M. Katz's essay on Netflix's "The Stringer" documentary offered a deeply personal meditation on photojournalism, credit, and the neocolonial dynamics of international news gathering. The documentary challenges the attribution of the famous "Napalm Girl" photograph to Nick Ut, suggesting the image may have been taken by a Vietnamese stringer named Nguyen Thanh Nghe.

> "The power of a photograph lies in its ability to compress reality into a single moment -- to capture the scattered attention of billions of viewers and concentrate it onto a single point, a laser beam cutting through time. This power doesn't belong to anyone, but the demands of the world we live in mean it has value." -- [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/31f0be51?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

Katz drew on his own experience covering the 2010 Haiti earthquake for the AP, reflecting on the seductive power of prizes and recognition -- and their ultimate arbitrariness.

### 7. Bari Weiss and the Collapse of CBS News Relaunch

**Coverage:** [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/thank-god-it-s-whiskey-friday-with-tony-dokoupil)

The Friday edition of Today in Tabs documented the spectacular failure of Bari Weiss's CBS Evening News relaunch with anchor Tony Dokoupil. The "spectacularly expensive" national tour generated "a humiliating blooper reel" and lost over a million viewers compared to the same week last year.

> "'The goal for this road show is not to deliver the news so much as it is to drive the news,' Ms. Weiss wrote in a note obtained by The New York Times. 'We need to be the news for these 10 days.'" -- [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/thank-god-it-s-whiskey-friday-with-tony-dokoupil)

The newsletter also highlighted Politico's reporting on the University of Austin (UATX), revealing internal conflicts at the institution founded by Weiss and others as a free-speech alternative to mainstream universities.

### 8. Notable Curated Readings

**Coverage:** [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/d8737e36?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/63dfbc79?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/0ce2fdf7?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [Kottke.org](https://kottke.org/26/01/0048163-north-america-kind-of-suc)

The Browser's curation highlighted several thought-provoking pieces:

- On psychological congruence: "If you are highly congruent, you disown none of your experience. You accept the stubborn approach of death, the arbitrariness of your fortune, your unimportance on the cosmic timescale, your potential importance for the local environment."

- On the history of scientific methods sections and how financial pressures changed academic publishing

- On medieval pig trials: "A pig eating a child was 'an unbearable inversion of the natural order.' The trial and public execution were seen as a 'surefire way to restore what was broken.'"

- On the death of mastery in boxing: Logan Paul vs. Anthony Joshua as "circus act, not a contest of skill"

[Kottke.org](https://kottke.org/26/01/0048163-north-america-kind-of-suc) featured links on North American elevator costs, the discovery of a starless "almost-galaxy" called Cloud-9, and the worker-owned relaunch of Gourmet magazine after Conde Nast forgot to renew the trademark.

**State Violence and Community Response**: The Minneapolis ICE raids appeared across multiple sources, with newsletters providing both reportage links and personal reflections on how to acknowledge ongoing crises while continuing normal cultural coverage.

**Authenticity and Credit**: Questions of authenticity ran through the week -- from AI-generated writing to disputed photo credits to the manufactured spectacle of the CBS News relaunch.

**Epistemic Uncertainty**: [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/63dfbc79?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) highlighted pieces on "the first type of knowledge to exist on Earth" (consciousness of pain) and the Internet Archive's mission to preserve digital memory. [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/what-have-self-148137146?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148137146&utm_id=40e538e6-fdc8-420d-bbff-cb47d3ec0289&utm_medium=email) invited readers to discuss "self-knowledge systems" from astrology to the Enneagram.
