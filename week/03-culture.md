# Week 03 Culture Newsletter Analysis (January 12-17, 2026)

## Overview

This week's culture newsletters converged on several urgent themes: the ICE immigration raids in Minneapolis dominated political discourse across multiple outlets, while a robust debate about AI's role in creative work and society threaded through technology and culture discussions. The newsletters also explored deeper questions about authenticity, identity, and the relationship between humans and machines---from Twitter addiction to exercise watches to "vibe coding."

Flaming Hydra and Today in Tabs took direct political stances on the Minneapolis situation, while Culture Study wove practical calls to action into broader cultural analysis. The Browser maintained its traditional curation approach, surfacing relevant pieces like Ryan Broderick's on-the-ground ICE reporting. Several newsletters engaged with questions of authorship, credit, and recognition---whether discussing a disputed Vietnam War photograph, AI-generated writing, or the question of who deserves awards and acclaim.

The week also saw substantial literary and artistic contributions: speculative fiction about a dystopian "re-homing" procedure, witch poetry, and reflections on Klaus Theweleit's "Male Fantasies." The newsletters collectively grappled with how to maintain humanity, community, and meaning in an increasingly technological and politically fraught moment.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. ICE Immigration Raids in Minneapolis

**Covered by:** Culture Study, The Browser, Today in Tabs, Flaming Hydra

This was the most consistently covered story across all newsletters, though approaches varied significantly.

**Culture Study** (Anne Helen Petersen) opened multiple newsletters with calls to action:
> "ICE's purpose is surveillance, spectacle, violence, and outright terror."
>
> "ONE SMALL THING YOU CAN DO TO HELP IN MINNESOTA RIGHT NOW: VENMO $5 TO THE ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AMBASSADORS. These students have watched ICE act violently on campus and organized a walkout."

**The Browser** featured Ryan Broderick's "We're All Just Content For ICE" from Garbage Day:
> "Brutal state violence and hysterical right-wing internet content work together in lockstep." Substackers and YouTubers are given a ring-side seat to the offensive. The ICE agents themselves seem to lack training and basic weapons skills.

**Today in Tabs** (Rusty Foster) addressed it personally, noting:
> "I haven't written anything about the Federal death squads terrorizing Minneapolis... it's not because I don't care. It's partly because my feeds have been completely full of horrifying news from Minnesota for more than a week."

He cited reader Winston Hearn from Minneapolis: "In Minnesota right now---despite the ongoing risks presented by untrained clowns who will deploy weapons of war against literal children when they get scared---the change has happened. Our true nature has been given a chance to emerge. It is so fucking powerful and beautiful that I struggle to capture what it feels like."

**Flaming Hydra** (Ian Williams) connected it to broader patterns in "Get Off Twitter":
> "Amid awful days of murder and bloodlust, the news broke last week that Twitter has a massive AI-generated child porn problem."

### 2. AI, Technology, and Creative Work

**Covered by:** Today in Tabs, Culture Study, Flaming Hydra

This week saw extensive, nuanced debate about AI's role in coding, writing, and creative work.

**Today in Tabs** devoted an entire issue to "vibe coding" and Steve Yegge's "Gas Town" project:
> "Vibe coding is the idea that nowadays you can just open a chat window and tell the AI to write your software for you without ever needing to read the code, and possibly without even knowing how to read it."

Rusty Foster positioned himself clearly:
> "Personally I am an AI hater. Anthony Moser captured my attitude perfectly... 'I am here to be rude, because this is a rude technology, and it deserves a rude response.'"

Yet he acknowledged complexity:
> "Writing code is one of the very few places where I could see it being useful as a tool."

He quoted Paul Ford: "AI is your general contractor, and you are the architect... AI can simulate intent, it doesn't actually possess it."

In his Friday edition, Foster presented multiple perspectives on AI coding, quoting Struan Donald:
> "For me the act of making a thing is partly about noticing. If you are taking a photo it is because something has caught your attention, and in order for that to happen you have to be paying attention. Writing is the same. You have to interrogate your thoughts and in the process understand the reasoning or feelings behind them."

**Culture Study** featured an interview with Vanessa Chang on "The Digital Body":
> "Technologies have long choreographed our bodies and primed our senses: keyboards train our hands, smartphones script our attention, earbuds filter our soundscapes, and chatbots train us to write and think in new patterns."

Chang offered a framework for evaluating technology:
> "We should approach technology from a framework of whether it 'expands or contracts our horizons'---whether it makes us more curious, more complex... or 'reduce[s] us to what can be measured and predicted.'"

**Flaming Hydra** (Jide Salawu) addressed AI in education:
> "What I sense coming, on social media as well as in conversation with colleagues, is a growing hunger for human-produced ideas, readings, and arts."

He quoted colleague James Yeku: "To use it ethically is the key. Never to surrender human agency to it."

### 3. Twitter/Social Media Addiction and Digital Wellness

**Covered by:** Flaming Hydra, Culture Study

**Flaming Hydra** (Ian Williams) delivered a fierce polemic in "Get Off Twitter":
> "The connective tissue here is simply that the people who run the world cannot, will not, get off Twitter."
>
> "There's no engagement on Twitter. Get rid of that excuse. If you're still on Twitter, you're a mark and an asshole who evidently approves of child porn."

He connected online addiction to deeper cultural malaise:
> "Something has broken in me because I see that all of it---AI, our collective addiction to this thing we call 'the internet,' the economy, the child porn, oafs murdering people in the streets---is connected but I lack the language, the smarts, to articulate the connection."

**Culture Study** (Vanessa Chang interview) discussed healthier relationships with technology:
> "I stopped charging my phone by my bed. It's a small gesture, but it's been a gamechanger for my sleep."
>
> "There are limits to what personal responsibility can accomplish... Data surveillance and extraction, algorithmic assumptions about who we are and what we want, are highly effective and they aren't problems individuals can solve by setting better boundaries."

### 4. Authorship, Credit, and Recognition

**Covered by:** Flaming Hydra, The Browser

**Flaming Hydra** (Jonathan M. Katz) wrote a powerful personal essay responding to "The Stringer" documentary, which questions who took the famous "Napalm Girl" photograph:
> "I fully inhabited the world shown in the film, whose totems---authorship, credit, and above all, the quest for recognition---were so central to our identities that they were worth risking our lives for, again and again."

On his own experience covering the Haiti earthquake:
> "I do remember thinking, I wish I'd been born rich."

On the nature of photography and credit:
> "The power of a photograph lies in its ability to compress reality into a single moment... This power doesn't belong to anyone, but the demands of the world we live in mean it has value. The purpose of credit is to channel that value to an individual."

---

### 5. The Death of Mastery and Expertise

**Covered by:** The Browser

**The Browser** featured "The Death of Mastery" about Logan Paul boxing Anthony Joshua:
> "Such a fight shows that in many spheres we are living through the death of mastery at the hands of entertainment. Paul ended up with a broken jaw, but his fame means he can keep cutting ahead of those with real expertise."

---

### 6. Media Industry Failures

**Covered by:** Today in Tabs

**Today in Tabs** chronicled Bari Weiss's disastrous week at CBS:
> "The new Anti-woke CBS Evening News with Tony 'Who?' Dokoupil premiered with a spectacularly expensive week long national tour that generated a humiliating blooper reel of technical errors and embarrassing segments and lost the broadcast more than a million viewers."

Weiss's stated goal backfired spectacularly:
> "'The goal for this road show is not to deliver the news so much as it is to drive the news,' Ms. Weiss wrote. 'We need to be the news for these 10 days.'"

On the University of Austin (UATX), Foster noted:
> "It was, after all, founded by the most cursed blunt rotation that the Devil ever assembled" - listing Jonathan Haidt, Larry Summers, Steven Pinker, Andrew Sullivan, Lex Fridman, and others.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Urgency of Collective Action
Multiple newsletters moved beyond analysis to direct calls for action---donating to Minnesota immigrants rights organizations, leaving Twitter, supporting student activists. This reflected a shared sense that traditional newsletter commentary was insufficient to the moment.

### Technology as Choreography
Both Today in Tabs and Culture Study explored how technologies shape human behavior and bodies, whether through "vibe coding" stages that transform how developers work, or through the ways exercise watches and smartphones "choreograph our bodies."

### The Question of Human Agency
Across AI discussions, photojournalism ethics, and political coverage, newsletters grappled with where human agency begins and ends---in relation to machines, institutions, and systems of power.

### Historical Framing
Several pieces reached for historical frameworks to understand the present moment: Klaus Theweleit's "Male Fantasies" on fascism (Flaming Hydra), the history of the "methods section" in scientific papers (The Browser), the Vietnam War era (Flaming Hydra).

## Surprising or Notable Insights

**On the strange optimism in crisis** - Winston Hearn's observation that the Minneapolis ICE raids have paradoxically revealed "our true nature" and something "powerful and beautiful" about community response. (Today in Tabs)

**On the em dash as "AI tell"** - Jide Salawu noted the absurdity of professors treating em dashes as evidence of AI authorship, when Emily Dickinson was famously devoted to them: "Em dashes are beautiful; they are the pillar of emphasis in writing. They help put the crown on your phrases." (Flaming Hydra)

**On technology's real cost** - Vanessa Chang: "A friend recently asked me how, as a woman nearing 40 who doesn't want children, she's supposed to manage the unrelenting ads and algorithmic assumptions about her reproductive future. The truth is: she shouldn't have to." (Culture Study)

**On the unreliability of AI agents** - Steve Yegge's "Gas Town" requires a special subsystem to remind AI agents to do their jobs: "Gas Town has a daemon that pings the Deacon every couple minutes and says, 'Do your job.'" (Today in Tabs)

**On homelessness as isolation** - The Browser featured a piece comparing Bay Area homelessness to Mumbai slums: "Being homeless was perceived as an individual failure... Mumbai's slums... have a real sense of community."

**On awards and recognition** - Jonathan Katz's admission: "I vividly remember standing in the flattened core of Carrefour, beside a building where uncounted bodies were trapped, listening to my boss's boss tell me to keep extra careful notes, because they were surely submitting my work for 'prizes.'" (Flaming Hydra)

**On the Situationist approach to technology** - Vanessa Chang proposed the "derive" or "drift" as a model for reclaiming agency: "You can allow it to serve you---just as a city can---but you don't have to submit to its logic of optimization. You can drift, wander, and play." (Culture Study)

## Literary and Artistic Highlights

**Nathan Munn's "Welcome Home"** (Flaming Hydra) - A chilling speculative fiction about three friends who undergo "re-homing"---a procedure that merges their consciousnesses into a single body due to economic necessity. The narrator reflects: "It was hard to argue with his logic, the brute logic of the market. In truth it wasn't Terrence, or Jenna, or me making this decision; it had been made for us."

**Carrie Frye's "Witch's Lament"** (Flaming Hydra) - A poem about a witch forced to release her beloved newts at a partner's request:
> "and then i walked
> back through the dark where
> nothing knew me anymore."

**Ian Williams on Theweleit** (Flaming Hydra) - A meditation on "Male Fantasies" and fascism: "We are, perhaps only aspirationally but still meaningfully, little Agamemnons underneath the thin cloth of civilization we all wear."

**The Browser on endangered crane chicks** - "If endangered crane chicks are to be successfully released into the wild, the young must believe their human attendants are birds. Thus, aviculturists don an elaborate costume with a bird's head puppet on one arm and a 'wing' on the other."
