# Week 03 Culture Newsletter Analysis (January 12-17, 2026)

## Overview

This week's culture newsletters converged powerfully on the ICE raids in Minneapolis, with [Kottke.org](https://kottke.org), [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email), [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/97f1ed49?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/4712d231?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), and [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/all-gas-town-no-brakes-town) all addressing the violence and its political ramifications. Beyond the immediate crisis, newsletters explored the ongoing tensions between technology and humanity: AI's disruption of creative work, social media's documented harms to adolescents, and how our digital tools shape our bodies and minds. A week of creative writing ranged from dystopian fiction about economic collapse to witch poetry, while curators surfaced eclectic pieces on medieval pig trials, the Iranian regime, and competitive brass bands.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. ICE Raids in Minneapolis: State Violence as Spectacle

**Coverage:** [Kottke.org](https://kottke.org), [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/what-have-self-148137146?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148137146&utm_id=40e538e6-fdc8-420d-bbff-cb47d3ec0289&utm_medium=email), [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/97f1ed49?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/4712d231?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/thank-god-it-s-whiskey-friday-with-tony-dokoupil)

The immigration enforcement actions in Minneapolis dominated culture newsletter discourse this week, with writers treating it not merely as news but as a cultural inflection point.

[Kottke.org](https://kottke.org) featured a direct call to action: "Abolish ICE. Abolish ICE. Abolish ICE. Abolish ICE." The newsletter linked to coverage of ICE killing a woman and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey's response:

> "Get the fuck out of Minneapolis." -- [Mayor Jacob Frey, via Kottke.org](https://kottke.org)

[The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/97f1ed49?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) highlighted Ryan Broderick's Garbage Day dispatch with this observation:

> "Brutal state violence and hysterical right-wing internet content work together in lockstep." -- [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/97f1ed49?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd)

[Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/what-have-self-148137146?utm_campaign=free_member_locked_newsletter&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148137146&utm_id=40e538e6-fdc8-420d-bbff-cb47d3ec0289&utm_medium=email) opened with a frank acknowledgment of the moment: "ICE's purpose is surveillance, spectacle, violence, and outright terror." The newsletter provided donation links and noted: "I know it feels weird to have mini-bulletins like this before talking about pop culture or personality tests or WHATEVER but this is what life is like right now: constant compartmentalization and negotiation."

[Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/thank-god-it-s-whiskey-friday-with-tony-dokoupil) addressed the raids personally, noting ICE may be coming to Maine next, and quoted reader Winston Hearn from Minnesota:

> "In Minnesota right now--despite the ongoing risks presented by untrained clowns who will deploy weapons of war against literal children when they get scared--the change has happened. Our true nature has been given a chance to emerge." -- [Winston Hearn, via Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/thank-god-it-s-whiskey-friday-with-tony-dokoupil)

### 2. Social Media, Screens, and Youth Mental Health

**Coverage:** [Jon Haidt from After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16), [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email), [Kottke.org](https://kottke.org)

Jon Haidt's After Babel published two substantial pieces this week advocating for age 16 as the global minimum for social media accounts, following Australia's lead. The argument centers on protecting puberty as a "sensitive period" of brain development:

> "The average adolescent in the U.S. now spends around five hours a day using social media. Their brains will enhance whichever neurons and circuits are activated repeatedly, at the expense of neurons and circuits that are underused." -- [After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16)

The second After Babel piece presented "mountains of evidence" from Meta's own internal research, including an experiment code-named Project Mercury:

> "People who stopped using Facebook for a week reported lower feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and social comparison." -- [After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/mountains-of-evidence)

[Kottke.org](https://kottke.org) linked to coverage of college students giving up phones for a week: "Most students said they had gotten to know themselves better without their phones butting in all day long."

[Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email)'s interview with Vanessa Chang on "The Body Digital" offered a more nuanced perspective, exploring how technologies "choreograph our bodies" while advocating for ecological thinking about tech rather than individual solutions:

> "If we want healthier relationships with technology, we have to build healthier technological ecosystems--not just better coping strategies." -- [Vanessa Chang, via Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email)

### 3. AI and Creative Work: Vibe Coding, Writing, and Authenticity

**Coverage:** [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/all-gas-town-no-brakes-town), [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/d2fb75d1?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), [Culture Study](https://open.patreon.com/posts/much-more-way-to-148087465?utm_campaign=patron_engagement&utm_source=post_link&post_id=148087465&utm_id=2585b41d-514a-45f7-accc-26c7b59d86f8&utm_medium=email)

[Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/all-gas-town-no-brakes-town) delivered a characteristically deep dive into Steve Yegge's "Gas Town," a development environment for managing multiple AI coding agents. Rusty Foster positions himself as "an AI hater," quoting Anthony Moser:

> "Because the makers of AI aren't damned by their failures, they're damned by their goals. They want to build a genie to grant them wishes, and their wish is that nobody ever has to make art again." -- [Anthony Moser, via Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/all-gas-town-no-brakes-town)

Yet the newsletter also engages seriously with Paul Ford's experiments and Casey Newton's Claude Code projects, noting the irreplaceable role of "taste" in directing AI tools.

[Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/d2fb75d1?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)'s Jide Salawu wrote from the classroom about AI's disruption to education and creative work:

> "What I sense coming, on social media as well as in conversation with colleagues, is a growing hunger for human-produced ideas, readings, and arts." -- [Jide Salawu, Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/d2fb75d1?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

He concluded with a quote from colleague James Yeku: "To use it ethically is the key. Never to surrender human agency to it."

The piece also pushed back against AI detection paranoia, noting that em dashes--"the pillar of emphasis in writing"--have been accused of being "AI tells," when in fact Emily Dickinson herself "might easily have been accused of generating her work on ChatGPT."

### 4. Twitter/X as Moral Crisis

**Coverage:** [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/4712d231?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

Ian Williams at [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/4712d231?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) delivered an impassioned call to leave Twitter after revelations about AI-generated child pornography on the platform. The piece examines how excuses for staying on the platform shifted as each was exposed:

> "The connective tissue here is simply that the people who run the world cannot, will not, get off Twitter." -- [Ian Williams, Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/4712d231?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

Williams connected online addiction to broader cultural malaise, invoking Klaus Theweleit's Male Fantasies:

> "The world feels poised on the precipice, about to topple over. We made it 100 years with the Bomb without annihilating the planet but it feels as though we may only make it through 15 years of Web 2.0." -- [Ian Williams, Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/4712d231?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

### 5. Photography, Memory, and the Power of Credit

**Coverage:** [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/31f0be51?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

Jonathan M. Katz wrote a deeply personal meditation on "The Stringer," a Netflix documentary questioning who actually took the famous "Napalm Girl" photograph. Drawing on his own experiences as an AP journalist in Haiti during the 2010 earthquake, Katz examined how credit, awards, and recognition shape careers--and how arbitrary these distinctions can be:

> "In that world, the world of The Stringer, those prizes open doors. They grant and signal worth. They are the difference between being just another schmuck who lives and dies, and having a chance--not the guarantee, but the chance--of being someone whose work is remembered." -- [Jonathan M. Katz, Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/31f0be51?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

The piece concludes with a meditation on how power flows from the photograph's focal point outward: "You can trace concentric circles of power from the focal point--chosen by the photographer, whoever it was--on the naked Kim Phuc."

### 6. Dystopian Fiction and Political Despair

**Coverage:** [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/b9e0c903?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122), [Kottke.org](https://kottke.org)

Nathan Munn's speculative fiction "Welcome Home" in [Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/b9e0c903?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) imagined a future where economic collapse forces young people to "re-home"--merging multiple consciousnesses into a single body to reduce living costs. It's a dark economic allegory wrapped in body horror:

> "Remember, you guys get all this," Terrence said drolly, sweeping his upturned palm from his chest down past his waist, showing off the goods like a game show host." -- [Nathan Munn, Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/b9e0c903?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

The story follows three broke friends as they negotiate the loss of individual identity, culminating in violence when one consciousness cannot accept the merger.

[Kottke.org](https://kottke.org) linked to a Guardian piece on the psychological toll of "polycrisis": "Many of us have 'lost the future' during the radical uncertainty brought about by polycrisis."

### 7. Bari Weiss and the CBS News Collapse

**Coverage:** [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/thank-god-it-s-whiskey-friday-with-tony-dokoupil)

[Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/thank-god-it-s-whiskey-friday-with-tony-dokoupil) documented the spectacular failure of Bari Weiss's CBS Evening News relaunch with Tony Dokoupil. The "spectacularly expensive" national tour generated "a humiliating blooper reel" of technical errors and lost over a million viewers.

> "'The goal for this road show is not to deliver the news so much as it is to drive the news,' Ms. Weiss wrote in a note obtained by The New York Times. 'We need to be the news for these 10 days.'" -- [via Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/thank-god-it-s-whiskey-friday-with-tony-dokoupil)

The newsletter also highlighted Politico's reporting on the University of Austin, revealing that the supposedly free-speech institution has become "Joe Lonsdale's Purity of Essence Anticommunist University, with only approved free speech allowed."

### 8. The Browser's Eclectic Curation

**Coverage:** [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/53ad4247?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/d8737e36?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/63dfbc79?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd), [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/0ce2fdf7?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd)

[The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/r/53ad4247?m=870013e5-9af6-40f5-bf0e-51ce412162bd) delivered its characteristic range of curated reading this week:

- On the Iranian regime: "Leaderless protests are brave, but fragile."
- On housing and community: "Being homeless was perceived as an individual failure. There is, of course, nothing to romanticise about Mumbai's slums. But despite these hardships, they also have a real sense of community."
- On medieval pig trials: "A pig eating a child was 'an unbearable inversion of the natural order.'"
- On Apple's design: "A squircle doesn't look like a square with surgery performed on it; it registers as an entity in its own right."
- On mastery vs. entertainment: "Logan Paul, a YouTuber, should not be boxing against Anthony Joshua... such a fight shows that in many spheres we are living through the death of mastery at the hands of entertainment."
- On psychological congruence: "If you are highly congruent, you disown none of your experience. You accept the stubborn approach of death, the arbitrariness of your fortune, your unimportance on the cosmic timescale."
- On crane conservation: If endangered crane chicks are to survive release, "aviculturists don an elaborate costume with a bird's head puppet on one arm and a 'wing' on the other."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**1. Technology as Double-Edged Sword:** Every major newsletter this week grappled with technology's benefits and costs--from social media's harm to youth, to AI's disruption of creative work, to the digital choreography of our bodies. The consensus tilts skeptical but not Luddite.

**2. Institutional Failure:** Whether discussing ICE, Twitter/X, CBS News under Bari Weiss, or academia's AI struggles, newsletters portrayed institutions as failing to meet the moment.

**3. The Value of Attention and Craft:** Against AI slop and algorithmic curation, multiple writers advocated for slow, deliberate, human attention. Struan Donald, quoted in [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/thank-god-it-s-whiskey-friday-with-tony-dokoupil): "The act of making a thing is partly about noticing... you have to be paying attention."

**4. Economic Precarity as Backdrop:** From speculative fiction about merging bodies to reduce costs, to discussions of journalist stringers vs. staff, to the crisis in journalism funding, economic anxiety permeated the week's cultural commentary.

## Notable Quotes

On leaving Twitter:
> "If you're still on Twitter, you're a mark and an asshole who evidently approves of child porn, that is, who doesn't disapprove of it enough to exit the child porn factory." -- [Ian Williams, Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/4712d231?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)

## Creative Writing Highlights

[Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/82e98546?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122) published Carrie Frye's "Witch's Lament," a tender poem about a witch forced to release her pet newts:

> "and they slipped their way / back through the silver mirror / of the water without one look / at me (even if the blind one / wasn't able) and then i walked / back through the dark where / nothing knew me anymore." -- [Carrie Frye, Flaming Hydra](https://flaminghydra.com/r/82e98546?m=e1004cfb-97ed-4594-9a60-f0bcd58e4122)
