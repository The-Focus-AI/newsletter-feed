# Week 03 Uncategorized Newsletter Analysis (January 12-17, 2026)

## Overview

This week's uncategorized newsletters span an eclectic range of topics: from mutual aid and class solidarity to AI-driven software development, decentralized protocol governance, and geopolitical analysis. [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) dominated the conversation around AI development methodologies with three posts on autonomous coding loops, while [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/mutual-aid-and-asking-people-what-they-need/) provided social commentary on homelessness, tech industry dynamics, and wealth inequality. [Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd) offered a deep dive into DeepSeek's unconventional business model, and [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy) explored the messy politics of ActivityPub governance.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. AI-Driven Software Development and the Death of Traditional Programming
**Coverage:** [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1), [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/10ca4a06?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1), [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/fb27d3d3?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1), [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/when-the-tech-leopard-eats-your-face/)

Geoffrey Huntley delivered three provocative posts this week about his "Ralph Wiggum Technique" for AI-assisted software development. His central thesis: traditional software development is dead, replaced by autonomous AI loops that can build software "cheaper than the wage of a burger flipper."

> "Software development is dead - I killed it. Software can now be developed cheaper than the wage of a burger flipper at maccas and it can be built autonomously whilst you are AFK." — [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/10ca4a06?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1)

Huntley describes a fundamental shift from "brick by brick" vertical development to loop-based approaches where AI agents perform tasks autonomously. He introduces concepts like "back-pressure" - the engineering of feedback mechanisms that reject invalid AI generations while not slowing the loop too much.

> "Back-pressure is part art, part engineering and a whole bung of performance engineering as you need 'just enough' to reject invalid generations (aka 'hallunications') but if the wheel spins too slow then it's too much resistance." — [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/fb27d3d3?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1)

In a particularly wild twist, [Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) revealed he has become a "walking, talking financial instrument" on the Solana cryptocurrency network, with people speculating on a $RALPH token tied to his work. He claims to have received $300,000 in his bank account within seven days, which he sees as potentially enabling "truly independent research that's published open/freely."

Meanwhile, [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/when-the-tech-leopard-eats-your-face/) covered the flip side of AI's impact on the tech industry: Adam Wathan of Tailwind CSS firing 75% of his engineering team because "AI has had brutal impact on our business." The newsletter notes the irony:

> "Adam has spent about the last decade talking about how much CSS sucks and how broken it is. His entire product - Tailwind - exists to devalue the skills and expertise of CSS professionals... A new technology coming out - one that he himself uses and enjoys - and devaluing his life's work is less tragic and more poetic." — [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/when-the-tech-leopard-eats-your-face/)

### 2. DeepSeek's No-Business-Model Advantage
**Coverage:** [Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)

Kevin Xu at [Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd) published a compelling analysis of why DeepSeek remains noteworthy despite no longer being the most capable, cheapest, or most open AI lab. The answer: its complete lack of a business model.

> "We should pay attention to DeepSeek because it has no business model - a unique and counterintuitive feature (not bug) among all frontier labs in China, the US, and elsewhere." — [Kevin Xu](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)

Xu contrasts DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng's self-funded approach (funded by his quant fund's $700 million profit on 53% returns) with xAI's recent $20 billion Series E raise. The lack of outside investors means no commercialization pressure, no internal resource competition, and no jealousy over compensation or equity.

> "I'm not even sure if I believe in AGI. But as an investor and a capitalist, I would love to get on DeepSeek's cap table. That being said, if DeepSeek ever lets me or any outside investor in, what made DeepSeek DeepSeek would be ruined for good." — [Kevin Xu](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)

The piece notes Ilya Suskevar's insight that breakthrough research often doesn't require maximum compute - AlexNet used just two GPUs, and the original Transformer paper used 8-64 GPUs of 2017 vintage.

### 3. Fediverse Protocol Governance and the Irony of Big Tech
**Coverage:** [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy)

Laurens Hof's [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy) newsletter delivered a fascinating deep-dive into how ActivityPub governance actually works. The W3C has announced a new Social Web Working Group to maintain and update the protocol, but the organizational structure creates an ironic situation.

> "There are only two organisations that are active in the fediverse that are a paid member of the W3C: Meta and the Social Web Foundation. With the Social Web Foundation also receiving funding from Meta, the company that built Threads now has more institutional standing in ActivityPub governance than any of the organisations actually building open fediverse software." — [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy)

> "This is by all accounts an extremely funny outcome for a network that aims to be independent of Big Tech's power." — [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy)

The newsletter also highlights a deeper structural problem: the disconnect between ActivityPub protocol development and the developers actually building fediverse software like Mastodon, PeerTube, and Lemmy. None of these organizations were present at the meeting where the SocialCG voted to charter the Working Group.

### 4. Class Solidarity, Billionaires, and Mutual Aid
**Coverage:** [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/mutual-aid-and-asking-people-what-they-need/), [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/who-stole-your-cookie/)

Chris Ferdinandi at [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/mutual-aid-and-asking-people-what-they-need/) shared a personal story about mutual aid, describing encounters with homeless individuals in his community during freezing New England winter temperatures. He ended up buying four sub-zero sleeping bags and a tent after learning one pair of homeless men had their blankets stolen the night before.

> "Ask 'what do you need?' Don't make assumptions about what someone needs or should want... Offer suggestions to signal what you're willing to give. People asking for help often won't ask for too much because they don't want to scare people off." — [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/mutual-aid-and-asking-people-what-they-need/)

In a separate piece, [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/who-stole-your-cookie/) delivered a sharp critique of billionaires and class dynamics, using Taylor Swift's $1 million donation (0.0625% of her wealth) as a jumping-off point. The newsletter invoked the Pixar film A Bug's Life to argue that power systems pit disadvantaged groups against each other.

> "Billionaire math is wild. Let's say you make $100k a year. It would take you 10 years to make $1 million. It would take you 10,000 years to make $1 billion." — [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/who-stole-your-cookie/)

> "We are all fighting for crumbs that fall from the overloaded trough of the rich." — [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/who-stole-your-cookie/)

### 5. U.S. Foreign Policy and Venezuela
**Coverage:** [Everything is Political](content/uncategorized/everything-is-political/2026-01-13-everything-is-political-we-are-not-living-in-unprecedented-t.md), [Everything is Political](content/uncategorized/everything-is-political/2026-01-15-everything-is-political-sanctions-are-a-tool-of-empire.md)

[Everything is Political](content/uncategorized/everything-is-political/2026-01-13-everything-is-political-we-are-not-living-in-unprecedented-t.md) published two pieces on U.S. intervention in Venezuela, arguing that the recent actions - including Trump's abduction of Nicolas Maduro - should not surprise anyone familiar with American foreign policy history. The newsletter frames sanctions as "a tool of empire" that primarily hurt ordinary people.

The January 15 issue included coverage of:
- "Trump's attack on Venezuela: An Exemplary Punishment" by Simon Rodriguez
- "Dissonant Solidarity: Venezuela and the International Left" by Luken Ignacio Quintana

### 6. Go Programming Language Updates
**Coverage:** [Golang Weekly](https://golangweekly.com/issues/585)

[Golang Weekly](https://golangweekly.com/issues/585) reported on Go 1.26 RC2 release with security fixes in archive/zip and Request.ParseForm, alongside maintenance releases for Go 1.25.6 and Go 1.24.12. Notable coverage included:

- A comparison of atomic operations vs. mutexes (conclusion: mutexes are often the better choice despite being slower)
- A tutorial on writing mutexes from scratch
- A story about finding and fixing a 50,000 goroutine leak
- A remarkably niche project: a Go runtime for the Sega Dreamcast (libgodc)

> "Even Linus Torvalds is 'vibe coding' now." — [Golang Weekly](https://golangweekly.com/issues/585), referring to Torvalds using Google's Antigravity tool for audio work

### 7. Career Transitions
**Coverage:** [Kirby Ferguson](content/uncategorized/kirby-ferguson/2026-01-15-the-exciting-conclusion-of-the-midlife-remix.md)

[Kirby Ferguson](content/uncategorized/kirby-ferguson/2026-01-15-the-exciting-conclusion-of-the-midlife-remix.md), creator of "Everything is a Remix," announced he has taken a job as producer of Sam Harris's "Making Sense" podcast, ending his "midlife remix" career transition period. He plans to migrate his mailing list to Substack.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### AI's Double-Edged Sword
Both [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) and [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/when-the-tech-leopard-eats-your-face/) covered AI's transformative impact on software work, but from opposite angles. Huntley celebrates the ability to build software autonomously at $10.42/hour, while Go Make Things highlights the human cost: layoffs, devalued skills, and the irony of technologists being disrupted by technology. The Tailwind layoffs and Huntley's "software development is dead" proclamation represent two sides of the same coin.

### Governance and Power Structures
Multiple newsletters examined how power actually flows in supposedly decentralized or democratic systems. [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy) showed how Meta has more formal power in ActivityPub governance than Mastodon. [Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd) explored how funding structure determines research priorities. [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/who-stole-your-cookie/) argued that systems of oppression pit the powerless against each other.

> "Using network architecture to solve issues of power distribution simply shifts bottlenecks rather than eliminating them." — [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy)

### Alternative Funding Models
[Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) and [Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd) both highlighted unconventional funding approaches. Huntley embraced cryptocurrency speculation ($RALPH token) as creator funding, while Kevin Xu praised DeepSeek's self-funded model as an enduring advantage. Both represent alternatives to traditional VC funding with its commercialization pressures.

---

## Surprising or Contrarian Perspectives

1. **Geoffrey Huntley becoming a financial instrument**: The idea that AI researchers can be funded through cryptocurrency speculation tied to their work represents a genuinely novel funding model, however speculative.

2. **"No business model" as competitive advantage**: Xu's thesis that DeepSeek's lack of funding and business model is actually what makes it special runs counter to typical Silicon Valley thinking.

3. **Meta having more power in Fediverse governance than Mastodon**: An ironic outcome for a decentralization movement, highlighting how formal governance structures can undermine grassroots intentions.

4. **Pre-commit hooks becoming useful**: Huntley notes that pre-commit hooks, traditionally annoying for humans, become valuable when AI agents are doing the development work.
