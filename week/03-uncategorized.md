# Week 03 Uncategorized Newsletter Analysis

## Overview

This week's uncategorized newsletters span a remarkably diverse range of topics: from mutual aid and class solidarity to AI-driven software development, from U.S. intervention in Venezuela to the governance of decentralized protocols, and from cryptocurrency-funded research to the death of traditional software development. A recurring undercurrent is the tension between systems of power and individual agency, whether in economic structures, technological platforms, or governance frameworks.

## Cross-Newsletter Themes

### AI Disrupting Traditional Work and Business Models
- **Coverage**: [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1), Go Make Things, [Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)
- **Summary**: AI is fundamentally reshaping software development and tech business models. Tailwind laid off 75% of its engineering team due to AI reducing traffic to their docs (despite growing popularity). Meanwhile, [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/10ca4a06?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) argues that "software development is dead" and can now be done "cheaper than the wage of a burger flipper." DeepSeek's approach of having no business model is presented as an advantage for pure AGI research.
- **Notable perspectives**: Go Make Things frames the Tailwind layoffs as poetic justice for a product that devalued CSS expertise. [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/10ca4a06?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) sees it as validation of his "Ralph loop" methodology. Kevin Xu at [Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd) argues counterintuitively that lacking a business model is DeepSeek's greatest strategic advantage.

### Systems of Power vs. Individual/Collective Action
- **Coverage**: Go Make Things, Everything is Political, [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/reports/fediverse-report-148-on-protocol-governance/)
- **Summary**: Multiple newsletters examined how power structures shape outcomes. Go Make Things argued that "nearly every system of oppression that exists today is designed to pit people who share the same struggles against each other." Everything is Political examined U.S. intervention in Venezuela as part of historical patterns of American imperialism. [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/reports/fediverse-report-148-on-protocol-governance/) revealed how the W3C's governance structure means Meta has more institutional standing in ActivityPub governance than organizations actually building open fediverse software.
- **Notable perspectives**: The [Fediverse Report's](https://connectedplaces.online/reports/fediverse-report-148-on-protocol-governance/) observation that "using network architecture to solve issues of power distribution simply shifts bottlenecks rather than eliminating them" applies broadly to all decentralization efforts.

### Alternative Funding Models for Research and Creation
- **Coverage**: [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1), [Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)
- **Summary**: Two contrasting models emerged for funding independent research. [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) received $300,000 in a week through Solana-based speculation on his work via the BAGS platform, while DeepSeek continues to self-fund from its quant fund profits rather than taking VC money.
- **Notable perspectives**: [Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) initially rejected crypto funding as "scammy" but came around to seeing it as "the perfect recipe for truly independent research." [Xu](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd) argues that DeepSeek's refusal of outside capital, even as "one of the richest men in the world couldn't say 'no' to more money" (referencing Elon Musk's $20B xAI round), preserves maximum internal alignment.

### Governance and Protocol Maintenance Challenges
- **Coverage**: [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/reports/fediverse-report-148-on-protocol-governance/), [Golang Weekly](https://golangweekly.com/issues/585)
- **Summary**: Both newsletters touched on the challenges of maintaining and evolving open standards and protocols. The W3C announced a new Social Web Working Group to finally update ActivityPub after 7 years. Go 1.26 RC2 was released, continuing the language's measured evolution.
- **Notable perspectives**: [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/reports/fediverse-report-148-on-protocol-governance/) highlighted the irony that "fediverse developers are excluded from the protocol development process" while simultaneously noting that developers of major platforms "have shown very little interest in engaging with the process when it was openly accessible."

## Surprising Insights

- DeepSeek's lack of business model is presented as a feature, not a bug. The argument that zero outside funding preserves research focus challenges conventional wisdom about needing capital to compete in AI. -- [Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)

- Cryptocurrency speculation on individuals as "walking, talking financial instruments" is now funding AI research, with [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) receiving $300,000 in under a week through the Solana-based BAGS platform.

- Meta and the Social Web Foundation (which receives Meta funding) are the only active W3C members working on the fediverse, giving a Big Tech company more institutional power over ActivityPub governance than Mastodon or other open source projects. -- [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/reports/fediverse-report-148-on-protocol-governance/)

- Tailwind CSS's revenue dropped 80% despite the framework being "more popular than ever" because AI assistants answer questions users previously found via documentation. -- Go Make Things

- You can now build Go programs for the Sega Dreamcast (1999 console with 16MB RAM and 200MHz CPU), complete with goroutines, channels, and garbage collection. -- [Golang Weekly](https://golangweekly.com/issues/585)

- Pre-commit hooks, traditionally annoying because they slow down humans, become valuable "back-pressure" in AI-driven development loops where humans are no longer doing the coding. -- [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/fb27d3d3?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1)

- Ilya Sutskever argues that major AI breakthroughs (AlexNet, Transformers, ResNet, o1 reasoning) were not compute-heavy projects, challenging the assumption that more GPUs always equals better research. -- [Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)

- **Notable Quote**: "Under normal circumstances pre-commit hooks are annoying because they slow down humans but now that humans aren't the ones doing the software development it really doesn't matter anymore."
- **Unique Angle**: Technical guidance on engineering feedback loops for AI agents, reframing traditionally annoying developer tooling as essential infrastructure.

## Patterns & Trends

These newsletters collectively suggest several currents in contemporary discourse:

1. **AI is forcing immediate business model reckonings** - Not hypothetical future disruption, but present-tense revenue collapse (Tailwind's 80% decline) and job elimination (75% layoffs). The speed is notable.

2. **Alternative funding mechanisms are gaining legitimacy** - From crypto-based creator speculation to self-funded quant profits, newsletters are documenting paths around traditional VC that preserve researcher autonomy.

3. **Governance bottlenecks persist despite decentralization rhetoric** - Whether in ActivityPub protocol development or wealth distribution, power concentrates in ways that contradict stated values. The W3C/Meta situation is particularly ironic.

4. **Class analysis is resurgent in tech discourse** - Go Make Things explicitly frames tech industry dynamics through class solidarity lens, while multiple newsletters critique billionaire philanthropy and corporate power.

5. **The "new computer" paradigm is crystallizing** - [Geoffrey Huntley's](https://ghuntley.com/r/10ca4a06?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) framing of LLMs as a fundamentally new form of programmable computer that requires new engineering practices (loops, back-pressure, context engineering) represents an emerging orthodoxy among AI power users.

6. **Open source is fracturing along funding lines** - DeepSeek open-sourced weights but not datasets; OpenAI released gpt-oss under pressure; Meta funds the org governing the protocol; funding source determines openness boundaries.
