## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. The Future of AI-Driven Software Development

**Coverage:** [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1), [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/10ca4a06?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1), [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/fb27d3d3?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1)

Geoffrey Huntley continued his provocative series on the "Ralph Wiggum Technique" - his methodology for autonomous AI-driven software development. Huntley argues that traditional software development is effectively dead, replaced by a new paradigm where code can be generated "for $10.42/hr" while developers sleep.

> "Software development is dead - I killed it. Software can now be developed cheaper than the wage of a burger flipper at maccas and it can be built autonomously whilst you are AFK." — [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/10ca4a06?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1)

His "ralph loop" concept treats software as "clay on the pottery wheel" - iteratively shaped by AI agents rather than built brick-by-brick. He explicitly argues against the multi-agent architectures that others are pursuing:

> "Consider microservices and all the complexities that come with them. Now, consider what microservices would look like if the microservices (agents) themselves are non-deterministic - a red hot mess." — [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/10ca4a06?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1)

In a separate post on "back pressure," Huntley emphasized the importance of fast feedback loops in AI-assisted development, recommending pre-commit hooks as a key tool - noting that they no longer slow down humans since "humans aren't the ones doing the software development."

> "If you aren't capturing your back-pressure then you are failing as a software engineer." — [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/fb27d3d3?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1)

### 2. Alternative Funding Models for AI Research

**Coverage:** [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1), [Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)

Two newsletters explored unconventional approaches to funding AI research outside traditional venture capital.

Geoffrey Huntley revealed he has received $300,000 through the Solana cryptocurrency network's BAGS platform, where fans can speculate on creators. He initially dismissed this as scammy behavior but came to see it as a new model for independent research:

> "What if instead we have the perfect recipe in the making for truly independent research that's published open/freely in the making and all I needed to was open up and communicate with you? I've already got venture capitalists chasing me left right and center for meetings but heading down that path would likely result in the same scenario that I'm in right now: conflicted. I am an old-school hippie hacker that deeply believes that knowledge should be free." — [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1)

Kevin Xu's analysis of DeepSeek offered a complementary perspective on self-funded AI research. He argues that DeepSeek's lack of outside funding - unusual in an industry "drowning in capital" - is its most enduring advantage:

> "DeepSeek has none of those expectations. Therefore, it has no business model and no need for a business model. The road to AGI requires compute, talent, and more than a healthy dose of good research taste. No one said it requires a business model." — [Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)

Xu points out that even Elon Musk's xAI "bent to the lure of outside capital" with a $20 billion Series E, while DeepSeek's founder Liang Wenfeng continues self-funding from his quant fund's $700 million annual profit. The organizational benefits include no internal resource competition and a flat structure without "jealousy and pecking order."

Xu also cites Ilya Sutskever's perspective on compute requirements:

> "Compute is large enough such that it's not obvious that you need that much more compute to prove some idea... AlexNet was built on two GPUs. The transformer was built on 8 to 64 GPUs. No single transformer paper experiment used more than 64 GPUs of 2017." — [Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd)

### 3. Digital Sovereignty and the Post-American Internet

**Coverage:** [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

Patrick Tanguay's Sentiers newsletter highlighted Cory Doctorow's vision for building a "post-American internet" that reduces dependency on U.S. tech infrastructure. The analysis identifies three vulnerabilities in current architecture: legal (anticircumvention laws like DMCA Section 1201), physical (transoceanic cables making landfall in the U.S. where NSA taps them), and software (lock-in to U.S. cloud services).

> "Since the post-war settlement, the world has treated the US as a neutral platform, a trustworthy and stable maintainer of critical systems for global interchange... But over the past 15 years, the US has systematically shattered global trust in its institutions." — Quoted in [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

The proposed solution involves repealing anticircumvention laws and building digital sovereignty on open-source software like the EU's Eurostack project. The first country to embrace this becomes the "disenshittification nation."

> "Let's call time on enshittification. Let's seize the means of computation. Let's build the drop-in, free, open, auditable alternatives to the services and firmware we rely on." — Doctorow, quoted in [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

The newsletter also covered Bryan Alexander's polycrisis analysis, challenging the "sclerotic Europe" narrative by citing Gabriel Zucman's data:

> "The US produces $81 in gross value per hour worked, but at a particularly high environmental cost. The EU produces $71 per hour, yet with far lower carbon emissions. More leisure time, better health outcomes, greater equality and lower carbon emissions, all with broadly comparable productivity." — Quoted in [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

### 4. U.S. Intervention in Venezuela

**Coverage:** [Everything is Political](content/uncategorized/everything-is-political/2026-01-13-everything-is-political-we-are-not-living-in-unprecedented-t.md), [Everything is Political](content/uncategorized/everything-is-political/2026-01-15-everything-is-political-sanctions-are-a-tool-of-empire.md), [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b)

Multiple newsletters covered the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela and the abduction of President Maduro on January 3rd. [Everything is Political](content/uncategorized/everything-is-political/2026-01-13-everything-is-political-we-are-not-living-in-unprecedented-t.md) ran two issues examining the intervention, framing it within the historical pattern of American imperialism and arguing that "we are not living in unprecedented times."

The newsletter positions sanctions as tools of empire that primarily hurt civilian populations rather than governments. The January 15 issue featured articles on "Trump's attack on Venezuela: An Exemplary Punishment" and "Dissonant Solidarity: Venezuela and the International Left."

[Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b) connected the Venezuela situation to Bryan Alexander's analysis of polycrisis, noting how multiple overlapping crises - demographic shifts, climate change, geopolitical tensions - are interacting and exacerbating one another.

### 5. Protocol Governance and the Fediverse

**Coverage:** [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy)

Laurens Hof provided an in-depth analysis of ActivityPub governance following the W3C's announcement of a new Social Web Working Group. The piece reveals a fundamental tension: while the protocol powers a network "that aims to be independent of Big Tech's power," the new governance structure concentrates formal power in ways that contradict these values.

> "There are only two organisations that are active in the fediverse that are a paid member of the W3C: Meta and the Social Web Foundation. With the Social Web Foundation also receiving funding from Meta, the company that built Threads now has more institutional standing in ActivityPub governance than any of the organisations actually building open fediverse software." — [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy)

Hof notes this is "an extremely funny outcome" but adds important nuance: developers of major fediverse platforms like Mastodon have historically shown little interest in protocol governance even when it was openly accessible.

> "Using network architecture to solve issues of power distribution simply shifts bottlenecks rather than eliminating them. A decentralised protocol does not automatically produce decentralised governance." — [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy)

The piece also discusses LOLA (Live Online Account Portability), a proposal for full account migration that could become an official W3C specification, and the disconnect between protocol maintenance and software implementation.

### 6. Tech Industry Layoffs and Billionaire Critique

**Coverage:** [Go Make Things](content/uncategorized/chris-gomakethings-com/2026-01-15-go-make-things-when-the-tech-leopard-eats-your-face.md), [Go Make Things](content/uncategorized/chris-gomakethings-com/2026-01-14-go-make-things-who-stole-your-cookie.md)

Chris Ferdinandi's Go Make Things newsletter delivered sharp commentary on Tailwind CSS laying off 75% of its team due to AI's impact on documentation traffic. Ferdinandi frames this as poetic justice given Tailwind's role in "devaluing the skills and expertise of CSS professionals":

> "A new technology coming out - one that he himself uses and enjoys - and devaluing his life's work is less tragic and more poetic." — [Go Make Things](content/uncategorized/chris-gomakethings-com/2026-01-15-go-make-things-when-the-tech-leopard-eats-your-face.md)

The layoffs were followed by Vercel and Google AI providing sponsorship funding - but notably without rehiring the fired employees.

In a separate issue on wealth inequality, Ferdinandi used Taylor Swift's $1 million donation (0.0625% of her wealth) to illustrate how "philanthropy is PR" and to argue that billionaires should not exist:

> "Billionaire math is wild. Let's say you make $100k a year. It would take you 10 years to make $1 million. It would take you 10,000 years to make $1 billion." — [Go Make Things](content/uncategorized/chris-gomakethings-com/2026-01-14-go-make-things-who-stole-your-cookie.md)

> "When the rich do philanthropy, it's brand sanitization. It's PR." — [Go Make Things](content/uncategorized/chris-gomakethings-com/2026-01-14-go-make-things-who-stole-your-cookie.md)

The newsletter draws parallels to the Pixar movie "A Bug's Life" and systems of power that pit the poor against each other.

### 7. Technical News: Go Language Updates

**Coverage:** [Golang Weekly](content/uncategorized/golang-weekly/2026-01-16-go-1-26-rc2-go-1-25-6-and-go-1-24-12-released.md)

Golang Weekly reported on Go 1.26 Release Candidate 2, including security fixes in archive/zip and Request.ParseForm. The newsletter also highlighted interesting ecosystem developments including a Go runtime for the Sega Dreamcast and tools for compiling Go programs for Windows XP and Windows 7.

Notably, even Linus Torvalds is now "vibe coding" - using Google's Antigravity tool to create digital sound effects.

### 8. Personal/Career Updates

**Coverage:** [Kirby Ferguson](content/uncategorized/kirby-ferguson/2026-01-15-the-exciting-conclusion-of-the-midlife-remix.md), [Hyperfixed](content/uncategorized/hyperfixed/2026-01-15-new-hyperfixed-premium-episode.md)

Kirby Ferguson (creator of "Everything is a Remix") announced he has been hired as producer of Sam Harris's Making Sense podcast, ending his "midlife crossroads" period.

[Hyperfixed](content/uncategorized/hyperfixed/2026-01-15-new-hyperfixed-premium-episode.md) released a premium episode called "Brainsquatch" featuring content about Bob's Burgers.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

### The Independence Paradox

A striking theme across multiple newsletters is the tension between independence and institutional power. [Kevin Xu @ Interconnected](https://interconnected.blog/r/5907b444?m=13ee6092-18b4-4710-96ca-c96c6fd588dd) praises DeepSeek for rejecting VC funding, [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/a0e555fe?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) explores cryptocurrency as an alternative to venture capital, and [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy) examines how decentralized networks still reproduce power concentrations. The common thread: independence requires active design choices, not just different architecture.

### AI Disruption Across Domains

AI's impact appeared in multiple contexts: [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/r/10ca4a06?m=6d763223-fea6-4f7b-98af-864085a0f8a1) proclaiming software development dead, [Go Make Things](content/uncategorized/chris-gomakethings-com/2026-01-15-go-make-things-when-the-tech-leopard-eats-your-face.md) reporting on AI-driven layoffs at Tailwind, and [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b) discussing how AI is "changing the physics of collective intelligence." The perspectives range from triumphalist to critical.

### Critique of Power Systems

[Go Make Things](content/uncategorized/chris-gomakethings-com/2026-01-14-go-make-things-who-stole-your-cookie.md), [Everything is Political](content/uncategorized/everything-is-political/2026-01-13-everything-is-political-we-are-not-living-in-unprecedented-t.md), and [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b) all examined how systems of power - whether billionaire wealth, U.S. foreign policy, or tech monopolies - concentrate benefits while distributing harms.

### Digital Sovereignty and Governance

Both [Sentiers](https://sentiers.media/r/1ce11db3?m=a8fb9fc0-1be9-42e3-a8a8-f807098a7f6b) and [Connected Places](https://connectedplaces.online/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tnptr&nltr=ODI7NjU4O2h0dHBzOi8vY29ubmVjdGVkcGxhY2VzLm9ubGluZS93cC1hZG1pbi9hZG1pbi1hamF4LnBocD9hY3Rpb249dG5wJm5hPXYmbms9NjU4LTNmNmU2NDBmZjImaWQ9ODI7O2Y5MjVkZDBhZThjMWNjMzI2YzM0MDEyYWY5ZTJiNTIy) grapple with questions of who controls critical digital infrastructure - whether through W3C membership fees or U.S. trade agreements that force anticircumvention laws on the world.
