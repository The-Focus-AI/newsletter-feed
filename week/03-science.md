# Week 03 Science Newsletter Analysis (January 12-18, 2026)

## Overview

This week's science-adjacent newsletters covered two distinct domains: nutrition science and creator business strategy. [She's A Beast](https://www.shesabeast.co/r/b1c2d016?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc) delivered an in-depth investigation into "protein inflation" and the collagen supplement scam, while [Jay Clouse](content/science/jay-clouse/2026-01-18-the-most-useful-30-minutes-of-my-week.md) explored productivity planning and self-publishing economics for creators.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Protein Inflation and the Collagen Scam

**Coverage:** [She's A Beast](https://www.shesabeast.co/r/b1c2d016?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc)

Casey Johnston delivers a detailed scientific breakdown of how supplement and food manufacturers exploit a labeling loophole to inflate protein claims. The key insight: collagen, while technically countable as protein on nutrition labels, provides almost no useful nutritional value for muscle building.

The piece explains the science using an accessible analogy:

> "Whey protein is a whole plane, built and ready to fly. But some proteins are 'incomplete,' just wings and landing gear, like rice. Beans are like the fuselage, tail, instruments, and everything else... Collagen is not only not a complete protein... As far as plane parts, it's like a giant pile of the metal panels that make the underside of one part of a wing." — [She's A Beast](https://www.shesabeast.co/r/b1c2d016?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc)

Johnston highlights specific products deceiving consumers:
- **Mel Robbins' "Pure Genius" protein shot**: Claims 23g protein, but 7g is collagen—only 16g is useful
- **"Sturdy Sauce" pasta sauce**: Claims 20g protein with only 7.5g contributing to actual nutritional value

The author explains how to verify these claims:

> "While any essential amino acid content in a food counts toward the number of protein grams on the label, the '% Daily Value' figure only counts complete proteins... This is why nutrition labels usually won't even bother putting % Daily Value figures on collagen-based products: It makes them look bad." — [She's A Beast](https://www.shesabeast.co/r/b1c2d016?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc)

### 2. Supplement Industry Accountability (or Lack Thereof)

**Coverage:** [She's A Beast](https://www.shesabeast.co/r/b1c2d016?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc)

Beyond collagen manipulation, Johnston addresses broader supplement industry fraud, referencing a viral investigation revealing protein powder that was "mainly flour and sugar" with "a tiny fraction of the protein claimed."

Her practical advice for navigating the unregulated supplement landscape:

> "If you want to use a supplement, use the ones that come from very large, established, old companies... Don't buy exciting; buy boring. It is far too easy in this country to 'start a company' with a P.O. box and an LLC filing, fill up a bunch of tubs with sawdust, print whatever you want on the nutrition labels, go 'whoops, haha!' when regulators come calling... and vanish in a puff of smoke." — [She's A Beast](https://www.shesabeast.co/r/b1c2d016?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc)

### 3. Public Health and Regulatory Decline

**Coverage:** [She's A Beast](https://www.shesabeast.co/r/b1c2d016?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc)

The newsletter touches on broader institutional failures, noting that "the government has stopped caring and no longer collects information" about economics, food, health, and jobs. Johnston also comments skeptically on the 2025 US dietary guidelines, suggesting that in "a completely deregulated country" the best approach may be to "all just ignore it and move on."

### 4. The Self-Publishing Advantage

**Coverage:** [Jay Clouse](content/science/jay-clouse/2026-01-18-the-most-useful-30-minutes-of-my-week.md)

Jay Clouse featured an interview with Paul Millerd, author of "The Pathless Path," who turned down a $200,000 book deal from Penguin to self-publish. The decision has paid off: Millerd has earned $325,000 in royalties to date, and recently released an ultra-premium hardcover edition.

The episode explores the economics and psychology of traditional vs. self-publishing, covering:
- The "dark side" of traditional publishing
- What kind of deal would have been worth taking
- When traditional publishing actually makes sense

### 5. Productivity Planning for Creators

**Coverage:** [Jay Clouse](content/science/jay-clouse/2026-01-18-the-most-useful-30-minutes-of-my-week.md)

Clouse shared a personal productivity insight: a task that had loomed on his to-do list for three months (creating a 2026 calendar for his community) took only 30 minutes to complete once he finally tackled it. The lesson is that seemingly "giant" tasks often become mountains in our minds but are manageable once started.

> "It felt like this formalization of my creativity. Plans are constraining! I just want to be punk rock!" — [Jay Clouse](content/science/jay-clouse/2026-01-18-the-most-useful-30-minutes-of-my-week.md)

The newsletter also explored urgency mechanics for evergreen memberships, noting that without open/close launch cycles, creators must find other ways to motivate fence-sitters to join. Clouse uses invitation-only access and timed events like Town Halls and mastermind matching as urgency drivers.

## Key Insights and Surprising Elements

**Consumer Protection Gap**: The [She's A Beast](https://www.shesabeast.co/r/b1c2d016?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc) piece reveals a significant regulatory blind spot—while the FDA requires protein content on labels, the distinction between complete and incomplete proteins allows manufacturers to legally mislead consumers.

**Follow the Money**: Johnston notes that collagen is "profoundly cheap to make and get" with "insane margins," explaining the economic incentive behind protein inflation.

**Practical Verification**: Readers learn a concrete skill—checking the % Daily Value against gram claims to detect collagen padding.

**Self-Publishing Economics**: Paul Millerd's $325,000 in self-publishing royalties significantly exceeds the $200,000 advance he was offered by Penguin, challenging conventional wisdom about the value of traditional publishing deals.

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**Consumer Skepticism and Due Diligence**: Both newsletters share a theme of looking beyond surface claims. [She's A Beast](https://www.shesabeast.co/r/b1c2d016?m=71f42b59-5c9c-43d4-809b-fcdf1c3ac9cc) urges readers to scrutinize nutrition labels and understand the difference between marketing claims and actual nutritional value. [Jay Clouse](content/science/jay-clouse/2026-01-18-the-most-useful-30-minutes-of-my-week.md) highlights Millerd's decision to forgo the prestige of a major publishing deal in favor of better economics, suggesting that established industry paths may not always serve creators' interests.

**Anti-Corporate Sentiment**: Johnston explicitly warns against trusting new supplement brands in a deregulated environment, while Millerd's story implicitly critiques the traditional publishing industry's terms for authors.

**Institutional Decline**: The themes of regulatory failure (in supplements) and industry misalignment (in publishing) reflect broader skepticism about whether traditional gatekeepers serve consumer and creator interests.
