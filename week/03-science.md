# Week 03 Science Newsletter Analysis (January 12-16, 2026)

## Overview

This week's science category features a single but substantial newsletter from Casey Johnston's "She's A Beast," which delivers an incisive exposé on what Johnston terms "protein inflation" - the practice of food and supplement manufacturers using collagen to artificially inflate protein counts on nutrition labels while providing minimal actual nutritional value.

## Main Topic: Protein Inflation and the Collagen Scam

### The Core Problem

Casey Johnston identifies a troubling trend in the food and supplement industry: companies are using collagen to inflate protein numbers on nutrition labels while delivering a fraction of the useful protein consumers expect. Johnston frames collagen as fundamentally worthless from a nutritional standpoint despite its technical classification as protein.

**Johnston's key characterization:**
> "Because it is made of amino acids, it technically gets counted into the protein figure on nutrition labels. But the thing brands really love about collagen is that it's profoundly cheap to make and get, because it has no useful nutritional content. It is, as I wrote then, meat garbage. The margins are absolutely insane."

### The Science Explained

Johnston provides an accessible analogy to explain why collagen fails as a protein source:

> "Protein is made up of different amino acids, like planes are made up of different parts. Whey protein is a whole plane, built and ready to fly. But some proteins are 'incomplete,' just wings and landing gear, like rice. Beans are like the fuselage, tail, instruments, and everything else."

**On collagen specifically:**
> "Collagen is not only not a complete protein, like most protein powders made of, say, whey. As far as plane parts, it's like a giant pile of the metal panels that make the underside of one part of a wing. Theoretically, other proteins could 'complete' collagen, but the only proteins that could do it are proteins that already have all of the amino acids you need anyway."

### Specific Products Called Out

Johnston provides concrete examples of products engaged in what she characterizes as deceptive labeling:

1. **Mel Robbins' "Pure Genius" Protein Shot**
   - Claims 23 grams of protein per serving
   - Only 16 grams are useful protein (7 grams are collagen)
   - Johnston cites Jen Gunter's analysis from The Vajenda

2. **"Sturdy Sauce" Pasta Sauce**
   - Claims 20 grams of protein per serving
   - %DV listed at only 15%, which mathematically equals 7.5 grams of actual useful protein
   - Contains "hydrolyzed bovine bone broth isolate" - which Johnston translates as "a long and fancy term for, you guessed it, collagen"
   - Johnston's verdict: "So of the claimed 20 grams, only 7.5 grams are useful protein. The rest is essence of hot ham water."

### How to Spot the Scam

Johnston explains the nutrition label trick consumers can use:

> "While any essential amino acid content in a food counts toward the number of protein grams on the label, the '% Daily Value' figure only counts complete proteins... This is why, for instance, the grams of protein in milk or cheese or chicken directly correlate—25 grams of protein in those foods will always be 50% of the '% Daily Value.' But 25 grams of beans, say, or rice, contribute significantly less to the % Daily Value than 50%. Collagen, a lot less."

**The tell-tale sign:**
> "This is why nutrition labels usually won't even bother putting % Daily Value figures on collagen-based products: It makes them look bad."

### The Broader Supplement Industry Problem

Johnston goes beyond collagen to address systemic issues in the supplement industry, referencing a viral YouTube video about protein powder fraud:

> "There is a whole viral YouTube video from last week about a protein powder sent for third-party analysis, and the results came back that the powder was mainly flour and sugar, and contained a tiny fraction of the protein claimed."

**Johnston's assessment of the regulatory environment:**
> "It is far too easy in this country to 'start a company' with a P.O. box and an LLC filing, fill up a bunch of tubs with sawdust, print whatever you want on the nutrition labels, go 'whoops, haha!' when regulators come calling (an increasingly unlikely event these days), and vanish in a puff of smoke. I'm only mildly exaggerating."

### Johnston's Recommendations

For those who want supplements:
> "If you want to use a supplement, use the ones that come from very large, established, old companies (for protein powder, but also everything else). Don't buy exciting; buy boring."

For those avoiding supplements:
> "And then if you don't want to use any supplements, which is entirely valid and sounds like a better idea every day: It is very possible to get all your protein from whole foods, even if you are strength training to build muscle."

## Additional Topics Covered

### Body Image and Women in Sports

Johnston highlights rugby player Ilona Maher's response to body shaming:
> "Newsletter spiritual leader Ilona Maher had an amazing response to a guy who said she looked pregnant in a dress. The reason more women don't look pregnant in dresses is because we're contorting our bodies and causing ourselves long-term damage, sweetie!"

This connects to Johnston's previous coverage of "hourglass syndrome" caused by chronic stomach-sucking.

### Viral Food/Fitness Trends

Johnston notes the viral "Orange Julius" protein shake trend (orange juice + vanilla protein powder), pointing out she wrote about this combination in her 2022 protein guide - an example of old fitness knowledge cycling through social media as "new" discoveries.

### US Dietary Guidelines Critique

Johnston references Public Health Dad's analysis of the 2025 US dietary guidelines, commenting:
> "It seems to me it'd be best if we take advantage of the way a completely deregulated country won't be able to apply this at all, and all just ignore it and move on."

### Statistical Infrastructure Collapse

Johnston highlights a Bloomberg piece on the deterioration of US statistical systems:
> "All you need to know is that no one knows what is going on with economics or food or health or jobs anymore, because the government has stopped caring and no longer collects information about these things."

### Scientific Motherhood

Johnston links to a piece arguing that "'Scientific motherhood' promised to create high standards for child-rearing. But it's really a system designed to police women."

## Key Insights and Surprising Perspectives

1. **The collagen profit motive**: The margins on collagen-based products are "absolutely insane" because collagen is essentially worthless nutritionally but legally counts toward protein totals.

2. **The %DV hack**: Consumers can detect collagen inflation by checking if the protein grams and %Daily Value correlate properly - a discrepancy reveals incomplete proteins like collagen padding the numbers.

3. **Regulatory pessimism**: Johnston suggests the current regulatory environment makes supplement fraud increasingly likely to go unpunished.

4. **"Buy boring" advice**: Counter to influencer culture promoting exciting new supplements, Johnston recommends established, large companies as the safest bet.

## Editorial Voice and Tone

Johnston writes with sharp wit and justified frustration. Her Arrested Development references ("hot ham water," "a throne of lies") provide cultural touchstones while her technical explanations remain accessible. She positions herself as an independent voice:
> "I know it sounds like a shill-ish thing to say, but I take no money from anyone..."

Her footnotes provide additional depth, including an acknowledgment that the "hot ham water" joke from 2006 could plausibly become "the next TikTok trend that becomes the subject of a hundred straight-across reported pieces about whether hot ham water is really the secret to health, wealth, and happiness."

## Patterns and Observations

This newsletter exemplifies science-adjacent health journalism that:
- Translates technical nutritional biochemistry for general audiences
- Calls out specific products and public figures by name
- Provides actionable consumer guidance
- Contextualizes individual issues within broader systemic problems (deregulation, statistical decay)
- Maintains a distinctly personal, often humorous voice while delivering serious analysis
