  - Brex uses Mastra framework with TypeScript for AI agents, Greptile for code review, and Sierra for customer experience.
  - [Platformer](https://www.platformer.news/r/103cfadc?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670) reports Meta hired Trump advisor Dina Powell McCormick as president, while cutting 10% of Reality Labs staff.

## Surprising Insights

- **AI Fluency as Hiring Requirement**: [Latent.Space](./content/tech-ai/latent-space/2026-01-17-brex-s-ai-hail-mary-with-cto-james-reggio.md) reveals Brex's new interview process requires agentic coding - "it's impossible to finish" without AI tools. Every existing employee, including managers, had to go through the new interview.

- **Apple Still Doesn't Get Vision Pro**: [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/2026/apple-you-still-dont-understand-the-vision-pro/) argues the Vision Pro's production approach (multiple camera angles, dedicated announcers) actively ruins the immersive experience: "All you need to do is simply set up the cameras and let me get from the Vision Pro what I can't get from anything else: the feeling that I am actually there."

- **Stack Overflow "Dead" But Revenue Doubled**: [Changelog News](./content/tech-ai/changelog-news/2026-01-12-linus-torvalds-gets-the-ai-coding-bug.md) notes only 6,866 questions were asked on Stack Overflow last month, yet company revenue is up 2x since 2022 - both caused by AI.

- **AI's Measurement Wall**: [AI Made Simple](./content/tech-ai/devansh-and-evercurrent-from-artificial-/2026-01-17-ai-is-hitting-a-measurement-wall.md) argues "We've built an entire evaluation infrastructure on exactly the epistemological assumptions that fail at scale" - models might be improving in dimensions benchmarks are structurally blind to. The brain's 100,000x efficiency gap over GPUs "is a physics feature, not an engineering bug."

- **Voice Cloning for Newsletter Audio**: [Platformer](https://www.platformer.news/r/f22155a0?m=5fdc9f67-a5ab-42ee-ab4f-91ba7b47c670) documents Casey Newton creating an ElevenLabs voice clone to narrate Platformer columns, launching "Platformer+" audio feed.

- **AI Companies Fear AI More Than Trump**: [Semafor Technology](https://semafor.com/s/7USHsf6Yja) reports companies now see greater reputational risks from AI misuse than from becoming a political target of the Trump administration - a shift from Q3 2025.

## Patterns & Trends

**1. The "Vibe Coding" Inflection Point**: This week marks a clear inflection in AI coding tool adoption. When Linus Torvalds starts using AI for code, and Casey Newton (a non-programmer) builds five useful tools in days, we've crossed from early adopter to mainstream viability. The tools aren't just writing code - they're enabling new categories of builders.

**2. AI Safety as Business Tension**: The Anthropic/Pentagon conflict and Grok scandal reveal a fundamental tension: companies that want to sell AI capabilities are discovering they can't control how those capabilities are used. Anthropic's attempt to set "limits on how it can and can't be used" in military contexts is being rejected. Meanwhile, Grok's failure to prevent deepfake abuse shows even basic safety guardrails can be trivially bypassed.

**3. Surveillance Technology Acceleration**: The ELITE revelation, combined with Flock camera deployments and ICE's facial recognition app Mobile Fortify, shows AI surveillance infrastructure is already operational at scale. The gap between capability demonstration and deployment has collapsed.

**4. Healthcare as AI Proving Ground**: The simultaneous moves by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google into healthcare suggest the industry views medical applications as a credibility test - if AI can be trusted in life-or-death contexts, it validates the technology for broader enterprise adoption.

**5. Measurement Crisis**: The most intellectually provocative thread is AI Made Simple's argument that our evaluation paradigm systematically destroys information about AI capabilities. If benchmarks can only capture what survives "projection" onto discrete yes/no tests, we may be blind to both improvements and dangers in dimensions we've "defined out of existence."

**6. Corporate AI Adoption Intensifying**: Brex's detailed transformation playbook - AI fluency levels, agentic interviews, specialized teams - provides a template other enterprises will follow. The "Quitters Welcome" recruiting strategy aimed at future founders signals how companies are thinking about AI talent.
