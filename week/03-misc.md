## Patterns & Trends

This week's newsletters collectively reveal a society grappling with fundamental questions about power, technology, and truth. Several patterns emerge:

**The Collapse of Shared Reality**: Multiple newsletters touched on how documentation and evidence no longer function as arbiters of truth. [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses) described the ICE shooting as proof that "consent doesn't even need to be manufactured anymore" - the state can simply declare its preferred narrative regardless of video evidence.

**Silicon Valley's Political Capture**: The revelation of OpenAI's president as Trump's largest Super PAC donor, combined with Palantir's ICE contracts and Musk's X propaganda platform, suggests the tech industry has become deeply embedded in authoritarian governance - a far cry from its libertarian origins.

**The Return of History**: From Niall Ferguson's analysis of counterrevolutions at [The Free Press](https://www.thefp.com/p/niall-ferguson-the-myth-of-revolution-in-iran) to Elliot Ackerman's discussion of Catch-22 to [Erik Davis's](https://www.burningshore.com/p/thar-she-blows) Moby Dick seminar, there's a clear hunger for historical frameworks to understand the present chaos. Multiple newsletters compared 2026 to 1989, 1979, or the 1960s.

**Biotech's Quiet Revolution**: While geopolitical chaos dominated headlines, [Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com) documented remarkable advances in magnetotherapeutics and brain-computer interfaces that may prove more consequential long-term.

**The Philosophy of Decay and Performance**: From [Tamara's](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-grace-in-withering) meditation on dying flowers to [Blackbird Spyplane's](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-anchovy-principle-how-to-build-sauce-berets-are-cool) anchovy principle, several newsletters explored authenticity, aging, and the exhausting performance of being a visible person in a mediated world.

**Institutional Fragility**: The attacks on the Fed, the FBI raid on a Washington Post journalist, the occupation of Minneapolis - this week illustrated how quickly institutional norms can erode when power decides to ignore them.
