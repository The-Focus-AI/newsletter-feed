# Week 03 Miscellaneous Newsletter Analysis (January 12-18, 2026)

## Overview

Week 03 brought an avalanche of coverage across miscellaneous newsletters, dominated by three major storylines: the Iranian regime's bloody crackdown on protesters (with death tolls reported up to 12,000), the escalating ICE operations in Minneapolis following the shooting of observer Renee Good, and geopolitical maneuvering around Venezuela and Greenland. [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/4be8d837-2bb0-4925-94ae-9091440dc17e?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) provided the most comprehensive daily political coverage, while [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-anchovy-principle-how-to-build-sauce-berets-are-cool) offered a striking contrast with fashion philosophy, and [Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-openai-and-sam-altman-back-merge-labs-bci) broke exclusive tech news about brain-computer interfaces.

## Major Topics and Stories

### 1. Iran Crisis and the "Myth of Revolution"

**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/b8a1f759-c266-4e32-abb5-a26086bc1060?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [The Free Press (TGIF)](https://substack.com/redirect/e2a7d8d3-2a74-4907-aa91-1ff7e4739262?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

Niall Ferguson's essay in The Free Press offered a contrarian historical perspective on the Iranian protests, arguing they are fundamentally counterrevolutionary rather than revolutionary. He traces a pattern of American liberals consistently underestimating the illiberal character of revolutions while disparaging counterrevolutionaries.

> "There is a difference between a revolution and a counterrevolution. It is a recurrent mistake of the American media to conflate the two." -- [Niall Ferguson, The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/b8a1f759-c266-4e32-abb5-a26086bc1060?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

Ferguson notes that Iran International reported 12,000 protesters killed in the regime's crackdown and provides historical context on why counterrevolutions typically fail: "The Cold War made it painfully clear, time and time again, that repression works."

The TGIF column added a satirical angle, noting Progressive International's bizarre inconsistency: calling to abolish police domestically while defending Iranian security forces as existing "within a radically different context: a state born of popular revolution."

### 2. ICE Operations in Minneapolis and the Renee Good Shooting

**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/683682f8-e74d-4a87-8879-a2db8f022d2a?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [Blood in the Machine](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses), [The Free Press (TGIF)](https://substack.com/redirect/e2a7d8d3-2a74-4907-aa91-1ff7e4739262?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

The shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent and the subsequent federal escalation in Minneapolis generated extensive and divergent coverage.

[Brian Merchant's Blood in the Machine](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses) provided the most extensive critique, connecting the ICE operations to Silicon Valley's role in enabling authoritarianism. He describes the week as "particularly unmooring" and argues that tech platforms have created conditions where "consent doesn't even need to be manufactured anymore."

> "The Trump administration simply declaring what it would like to have transpired, even in the face of ample and obvious documentation to the contrary, works." -- [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses)

Merchant also provided personal reporting from LA, describing ICE staging at a local church near his home and detailing community rapid-response networks.

[The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/683682f8-e74d-4a87-8879-a2db8f022d2a?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) offered more ground-level reporting with Olivia Reingold joining "ICE Watch" Signal chats and accessing their license plate databases. The TGIF column cited Quinnipiac polling showing 57% of voters disapprove of ICE enforcement methods and 53% believe the Good shooting was not justified.

### 3. Venezuela, Greenland, and Trump's Foreign Policy

**Coverage:** [Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle), [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/4be8d837-2bb0-4925-94ae-9091440dc17e?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [The Free Press (Catch-22)](https://substack.com/redirect/27079505-da1d-4669-bc7a-904a4a591e1d?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

[Tomas Pueyo's Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle) offered detailed economic analysis of Venezuela's oil viability, concluding that extracting significant value would require massive investment that oil companies are reluctant to make after being "stripped of their Venezuelan investments not once, but twice."

> "We have had our assets seized there twice and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen. Today, it's uninvestable." -- ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, quoted in [Uncharted Territories](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/is-venezuelas-oil-worth-the-hassle)

Multiple Free Press editions covered the Maduro capture and Trump's Greenland ambitions, with Matt Pottinger and Roy Eakin arguing "2026 could prove to be the most consequential year in world history since 1989."

[PJ Vogt's Search Engine podcast](https://pjvogt.substack.com/p/the-venezuelan-curse-part-1) launched a multi-part investigation featuring Venezuelan historian Alejandro Velasco, seeking "to understand why a country with so much promise has proven so difficult to govern."

Elliot Ackerman's podcast on Catch-22 in [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/27079505-da1d-4669-bc7a-904a4a591e1d?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) provided timely commentary on war's absurdity, noting that Americans have been "shielded for the past few decades from the true costs of war" through an all-volunteer military and deficit spending.

### 4. Scott Adams Death and Legacy

**Coverage:** [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/5cbf9c0a-40de-4653-8d48-125464c694f0?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [Mailbrew](content/misc/mailbrew/2026-01-14-daily-digest-1769.md), [The Free Press (TGIF)](https://substack.com/redirect/e2a7d8d3-2a74-4907-aa91-1ff7e4739262?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), [The Free Press (Weekend)](https://substack.com/redirect/9c3a6daa-ee44-42c6-8752-ccf2876f611e?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

Coleman Hughes wrote a nuanced tribute in [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/5cbf9c0a-40de-4653-8d48-125464c694f0?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8), acknowledging Adams' controversial statements while crediting him with intellectual influence. Hughes applied Adams' persuasion framework to Trump's "cats and dogs" comments about Haitian immigrants.

> "An easily debunkable lie in the text can be an honest signal in the subtext. ('I care so much about curbing immigration that I'm willing to make a fool of myself.')" -- [Coleman Hughes, The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/5cbf9c0a-40de-4653-8d48-125464c694f0?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8)

The TGIF column contrasted the New York Times' Adams obituary headline ("whose comic strip Dilbert was a sensation until he made racist comments on his podcast") with their Stalin obituary ("Rose From Czarist Oppression to Transform Russia Into Mighty Socialist State").

### 5. Brain-Computer Interface Breakthrough: Merge Labs

**Coverage:** [Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-openai-and-sam-altman-back-merge-labs-bci)

[Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-openai-and-sam-altman-back-merge-labs-bci) broke exclusive news about Merge Labs, a $252 million BCI startup backed by Sam Altman, OpenAI, and others. The company aims to create brain-computer interfaces using ultrasound technology and protein reporters rather than invasive electrodes.

> "One of our core beliefs is that we can build brain computer interfaces that can interface with many more neurons in the brain than is possible with existing technologies in a form factor that is much less invasive." -- Mikhail Shapiro, quoted in [Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-openai-and-sam-altman-back-merge-labs-bci)

The article notes this could eventually become consumer technology rather than purely medical devices, with co-founder Sumner Norman stating: "We fundamentally believe that restoration and augmentation live on a continuum."

### 6. Magnetotherapeutics: A New Paradigm in Cancer Treatment

**Coverage:** [Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-fridge-magnet-medicine-nonfiction-labs-cancer)

[Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-fridge-magnet-medicine-nonfiction-labs-cancer) broke news on Nonfiction Labs, developing magnetically-controlled therapeutics that can be switched on or off by external magnetic fields.

> "A magbody therapeutic could circulate for weeks, inert, activating only where and when it's needed. Local activation allows for safely hitting tumor cells at doses that would be lethal if engaged body-wide." -- [Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-fridge-magnet-medicine-nonfiction-labs-cancer)

This could represent a paradigm shift in how cancer therapies are delivered, offering precision activation rather than systemic toxicity.

### 7. Style and Culture Philosophy

**Coverage:** [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-anchovy-principle-how-to-build-sauce-berets-are-cool), [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/bad-advice)

[Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-anchovy-principle-how-to-build-sauce-berets-are-cool) offered an extended meditation on wearing berets through what they call "The Anchovy Principle" -- the idea that bold fashion choices, like anchovies, must be carefully integrated into one's overall "sauce" before they stop overwhelming the whole.

> "Somewhere down the line, your clothes melt into your whole mf gestalt. In turn, your sense of self expands to accommodate garments that once seemed too potent." -- [Blackbird Spyplane](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/the-anchovy-principle-how-to-build-sauce-berets-are-cool)

A follow-up piece argued against the common advice to "not care what other people think" about fashion, noting: "Clothes are how we speak to others without actually speaking to them... you can't step outside of clothes."

### 8. Agriculture, History, and Human Origins

**Coverage:** [Adjacent Possible](https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/the-agrarian-fall)

[Steven Johnson's Adjacent Possible](https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/the-agrarian-fall) examined the "Agrarian Fall" -- the scholarly consensus that agriculture was initially a downgrade for humanity rather than progress. Johnson notes a "massive, unexplained gap in the timeline between the first domestication of crops and the emergence of the first agrarian states."

> "If we were expelled from the Garden, it appears we spent several thousand years loitering by the exit." -- [Steven Johnson](https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/the-agrarian-fall)

### 9. Trauma, PTSD, and Military Psychology

**Coverage:** [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/network-centric-warfare-from-f-14s), [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/yuval-neria-ptsd-trauma-equine-psychedelics-ooda)

[The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/yuval-neria-ptsd-trauma-equine-psychedelics-ooda) featured Dr. Yuval Neria, a Yom Kippur War Medal of Valor recipient turned PTSD researcher, discussing innovative treatments including psychedelics and equine-assisted therapy. A related piece explored Network Centric Warfare and the F-14 Tomcat's influence on military doctrine.

> "Trauma is the event; the disorder is the emotional charge welded to memory. The job of recovery is to separate the two, restore meaning, and rebuild trust." -- Dr. Yuval Neria, quoted in [The Whirl of ReOrientation](https://thewhirl.substack.com/p/yuval-neria-ptsd-trauma-equine-psychedelics-ooda)

### 10. Technology and Philosophy

**Coverage:** [Contraptions](https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/new-nature), [Digital Grove](https://www.rfleury.com/p/the-magic-of-the-better-software)

[Venkatesh Rao's Contraptions](https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/new-nature) introduced "New Nature" -- technological regimes governed by laws as inviolable as nature itself, with public-key cryptography as the Genesis event. He proposes a "Central Dogma": creating mechanisms for human regulation of technology necessarily creates attack surfaces for capture by the worst actors.

[Digital Grove](https://www.rfleury.com/p/the-magic-of-the-better-software) reflected on the Better Software Conference and "Eternal September" -- the phenomenon where organizational quality necessarily diminishes as membership grows and exclusivity decreases.

> "People are not fungible... the initial formulation of an organization -- who is in it -- is critical." -- [Ryan Fleury, Digital Grove](https://www.rfleury.com/p/the-magic-of-the-better-software)

### 11. The Future of Code: AI Agents and the Death of Software Development

**Coverage:** [Joy & Curiosity](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-70-d85), [Mailbrew](content/misc/mailbrew/2026-01-18-daily-digest-1773.md)

[Thorsten Ball's Joy & Curiosity #70](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-70-d85) delivered the week's most provocative meditation on what AI agents mean for code itself. Ball describes building a Rust program to automate email responses, only to realize the program could be replaced by instructions in a Markdown file for an AI agent.

> "No code, only Markdown. Yes, not every codebase can be turned into instructions for an agent, and yes, it's inefficient and costs money. But, directionally, there are quite a few things that can be deconstructed into simply an agent with the right instructions and tools, are there not?" -- [Thorsten Ball](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-70-d85)

Ball highlights Cursor's extraordinary announcement: they had agents write a web browser from scratch, running for close to a week and producing over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. Michael Truell elaborated that it's actually 3M+ lines with a from-scratch rendering engine in Rust including HTML parsing, CSS cascade, layout, and a custom JavaScript VM.

> "The Death of Software Development: While software development as we know it is dead, software engineering is alive and well. The role has transformed. Engineers are no longer writing software -- they're designing higher-order systems." -- quoted in [Joy & Curiosity](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-70-d85)

Ball also noted that antirez (creator of Redis) is encouraging developers to not "fall into the anti-AI hype," while Linus Torvalds used Antigravity to help fix his audio visualization tool, commenting: "Is this much better than I could do by hand? Sure is."

The week also saw significant tech news in [Mailbrew](content/misc/mailbrew/2026-01-17-daily-digest-1772.md) including Cloudflare's acquisition of Astro and coverage of Erdos 281 being solved with ChatGPT 5.2 Pro, plus Apple's reported selection of Google's Gemini to power AI-enhanced Siri.

### 12. Personal Essays and Reflections

**Coverage:** [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-grace-in-withering), [Molly Young](https://mollyyoung.substack.com/p/little-joys-for-2026), [Erik Davis](https://www.burningshore.com/p/thar-she-blows)

[Tamara's "The Grace in Withering"](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-grace-in-withering) offered a meditation on decay and authenticity, pushing back against filtered beauty standards.

> "Beauty, finally, is just biology relaxing." -- [Tamara](https://museguided.substack.com/p/the-grace-in-withering)

[Molly Young](https://mollyyoung.substack.com/p/little-joys-for-2026) shared "little joys for 2026" including cinnamon-sugar croissants and building theremins. [Erik Davis](https://www.burningshore.com/p/thar-she-blows) wrote about rereading Moby Dick and its "Lovecraftian dimension."

## Cross-Newsletter Patterns

**The Erosion of Truth**: Multiple newsletters grappled with epistemological breakdown. [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses) argued we're "well beyond epistemic closure" where documentation doesn't matter. [Niall Ferguson](https://substack.com/redirect/b8a1f759-c266-4e32-abb5-a26086bc1060?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) noted American liberals' persistent misreading of revolutions. [Coleman Hughes](https://substack.com/redirect/5cbf9c0a-40de-4653-8d48-125464c694f0?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) explored how lies can function as "honest signals."

**Technology's Double Edge**: [Core Memory](https://www.corememory.com/p/exclusive-openai-and-sam-altman-back-merge-labs-bci) celebrated BCI advances while [Brian Merchant](https://bloodinthemachine.substack.com/p/abolish-the-senses) documented tech's role in authoritarian operations. [Contraptions](https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/new-nature) sought a middle path, arguing for "capture-resistant" technologies.

**The Value of Exclusivity vs. Inclusion**: [Digital Grove's](https://www.rfleury.com/p/the-magic-of-the-better-software) defense of selective conferences echoed [Blackbird Spyplane's](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/bad-advice) argument that style is irreducibly social. Both push back against the growth-at-all-costs mentality.

**War Returns to Center Stage**: [The Free Press](https://substack.com/redirect/27079505-da1d-4669-bc7a-904a4a591e1d?j=eyJ1IjoiMWllZnkifQ.sG3OqnkHDNZpplC0eLA9u0NYhAE4J8yHwSPDyeVA8k8) invoked Pope Leo XIV's warning that "war is back in vogue." Multiple newsletters addressed Venezuela, Iran, Greenland, and domestic ICE operations as manifestations of renewed conflict.

## Notable Curated Content

[Jodi Ettenberg's Legal Nomads](https://jodiettenberg.substack.com/p/fifty-eight) provided an exceptionally comprehensive link roundup including year-end lists, Parkinson's research linking the disease to water contamination, and a Canadian water-tasting competition profile.

[Beth Mathews](https://bethmathews.substack.com/p/the-design-history-behind-the-i-am) delivered design history on the "I AM A MAN" protest poster from the 1968 Memphis sanitation workers' strike, relevant for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
